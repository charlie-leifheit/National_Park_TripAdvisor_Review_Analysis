Dry Tortugas National Park,I guess if you're going to do the snorkeling it might be worth it but we don't snorkel so it was an extremely overpriced trip to an historical fort. The fort itself didn't have much in the way of displays and although the tour was interesting to a point the guide thought he was more clever than he actually was and tended to run on and on. The catamaran ride was ok but very long and the food served was cheap and poor quality. The staff was nice but I can think of many better ways to spend that kind of money. Not only was it expensive to start with but then they hit you up for tips at the end.,"October 18, 2019",Just OK,0,"Orlando, Florida",2

Dry Tortugas National Park,"What an awesome adventure. This is a day long ""activity"", starting at 7 am with check-in and ending around 5 pm when you get back. The boat ride out and back can be a bit cramped, and the water can be a bit ""choppy"", but that is part of the experience. The staff aboard the Yankee Freedom III are awesome. The narration there and back is very informative, and entertaining. A galley style breakfast and lunch are served, not 4 star, but appropriate and good. Once there, the narrated fort tour is awesome, as is the snorkeling and snorkeling equipment. Don't let the price fool you, this price covers a full day of entertainment. On the way back, you can have a made to order frozen drink and snack, with ample choices.","October 17, 2019",Excellent day trip,4,"Norman, Oklahoma",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The ferry leaves early in the morning. So arrive earlier like they suggest. We were a bit later than others so we missed the part about downloading an app where once you arrived you could take off and do your own self guided tour using their app. Once you leave Key West you will NOT have cell service to download it anymore. Luckily they also offer guided tours around 20 minutes and after that another extended tour following for about another 45 minutes (free). Your time is limited once at the Park...boat arrives around 10:30 AM and you leave around 3 PM to be home around 5:30 PM. The boat ride over can be choppy so I highly recommend taking motion pills as a precaution. I had my own but they did sell some on the boat for a $1 each. You really should already have them in your system an hour before boating so TAKE some. You don't want to ruin this special day. They serve a nice breakfast buffet (included)...bagels, dry cereals, orange juice, milk, coffee, hot teas, boiled eggs, fruit, peanut butter, breads. You could go back for more if you wanted to. When you arrive they start prepping for lunch (included) around 11:30 AM...several bread options for making sandwiches, assortments of chips, cookies, bottle of waters, a few sodas to choose from. You can also purchase other items like ice cream sandwiches, corn dogs and such. With limited time we chose to sign up for the guided tour and get that behind us and then come back to the board the boat for lunch. The long lines were down by then. After lunch is when we picked up our snorkle gear and there was no line. The ONLY bathrooms are on the boat so if you have to go you'll have to get back on the boat. The boat is very close by though. They do have several changing rooms on the grounds so you'll wnat to bring a change of dry clothes for the ride back. On the way home they will open the BAR (cash or card)...they do not serve alcohol on the way over. However you can bring alcohol in a backback cooler to enjoy once on the island. You cannot bring it into the fort though, but there are many benches to hang out on around the exterior. We brought our backpack cooler so we had several snacks and drinks with us while on the island. I wish I had realized the beach there is crushed shells and coral. It's more fine on the beach walking area, but once in the water it can be one inch to six inch pieces of broken coral...couldn't feel sand at all so bring water shoes for sure.","October 17, 2019",A MUST do Trip!,17,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Great day touring and snorkeling. The crew and the boat ride over are excellent. The fort is really quite amazing even without a formal tour. The water was beautiful, although was a bit cloudy. We had to swim out a ways to get to clearer water and was never quite clear. I think this is maybe due to wind or waves or ??, but still fun. Food on the boat out and back was solid. They even sell mixed drinks and beer after about 2:00. Saw many turtles on the way out and back. Will go again and will take friends, maybe even camp.

He had an excellent knowledge of the history of the area and a true passion for sharing his knowledge and love of the area. It is well worth your time to walk through the self guided tour of the fort and the snorkeling was excellent. It is an all day trip but we found ourselves wishing we had had more time there.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Camping is an amazing experience. Rent your equipment from campingfloridakeys.com. Everything you need except food and water. They bring it to you at the pier and pick it back up from the same spot. Yes there are rats. Yes it is hot. But the sunset, stars, and sunrise quickly make you forget. The snorkeling is amazing. Follow the moat around for the best views. Rent a kayak (call Tracy), paddle the 3 miles to Loggerhead key for your private island picnic and snorkel, then hustle back in time for happy hour and a hot dog on board the Freedom express. Never has a pina colada tasted so good! Fishing is fantastic. We caught a 10 lb red striper right outside the swim area from our kayak, paddled back in to clean it and throw it on some charcoal with a bed of lemon and our dinner was ready right after the breathtaking sunset. Btw... having the freedom express come in every day was an excellent support resource. We took full advantage of the freshwater rinse showers, happy hour, and food and ice for purchase. The pit toilets were the cleanest I’ve ever seen. Way better than 80% of gas station bathrooms. ","October 9, 2019",Camping,2,"Newport News, Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"People from all over the world travel to Key West for the climate and party scene.Yes, it's undeniably there to enjoy, but you're really not experiencing the real Key West unless you take an interest in it's history in the form of the fascinating former military fort , Ft. Jefferson at Dry Tortuga National Park.I and my family were amazed by the architecture,engineering and masonry work employed to build this fort without any modern equipment available today. The fort is truly a testament to the ingenuity of humanity displayed when people put their minds to accomplish something.The island itself is beautiful. Despite the beach being very narrow, it's still a nice little swim in a natural surrounding where, if the visibility allows you can snorkel about .The park is accessible by boat or seaplane. The boat ride is like 2 1/2 hours, however if you or someone in your party is prone to seasickness, the seaplane might be a better option- it can be a bumpy journey.The park is great for families too , especially kids. I saw a bunch of kids there of all ages; not one of them seemed bored to me.You can enjoy balmy weather and party scenes throughout the Caribbean and south Florida but Ft. Jefferson is one of a kind . In my opinion it would be a shame if you didn't take advantage of a day trip there while in Key West.","October 8, 2019",The REAL Key West,29,"Palm Beach, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"At first you pull up on the dry Tortugas ferry and it looks like one of the forts that you may have visited anywhere in the country. It wasn’t until I got inside and saw the untouched condition that I realized that I was someplace very special. I’ve been in many of forts around the country and they have things blocked off, Restrictions everywhere along with no touch signs. This place is crazy in that you can go anywhere you want and let me tell you it is dangerous at times! You have free rein to investigate three floors of the fort. On the top you are literally inches from the edge which is crumbling and falling apart. This is NOT a place for kids. This is a place for adults that enjoy history, culture and peace! You can lay on the beach, swim I. Calm waters on one side of the fort and wi day rougher waters on the other side of the fort. The tour guide was so totally into the fort. His excitement and long tour was great for the very interested but a little too long for me and my daughter. We ventured off alone and had a wonderful time exploring but I was scared on that third floor. I don’t know if I ever need to go back but I am so glad we went.","October 3, 2019","You must find the beauty in old, natural, untouched",372,"Boca Raton, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Yes, this park is quite beautiful. Yes, it is a must do when in Key West. Yes, take the sea plane if you can. The plane took about 30 minutes to get there vs hours by the ferry. Touring the park takes about 90 minutes leaving time to swim/snorkel. The whole trip took about 4 hours, start to return. Read what everyone says if you must, just go.","October 2, 2019",Take the sea plane,8,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"6 years ago Obama shut the Government down and closed the park during our visit, a year later I had a ticket however the night before the ferry had mechanical problems and the rest of our week there were no trips...today having bought my ticket in advance on line I finally got to see Fort Jefferson and I cannot find all the words to describe how wonderful it was to finally see. I did not snorkel, didn’t plan on it and pretty glad because the water was cloudy however to photograph the Fort priceless! Took the boat shuttle which was well worth the price.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I love National Parks and the Dry Tortugas did not disappoint. The water is beautiful and the fort is impressive. You can roam around the island which is a rarity today. You get plenty of time to explore the fort and then go swimming. I have an annual National Park pass and it saved me $30 for two people. If you have a bunch of people in your group, pay the $80 annual fee. I also brought my college student ID and saved me $10. However, The ferry to the island was average. It’s about 2.5 hours each way. The guide gave good information on the boat and while in the fort. The breakfast and lunch was just okay. For the cost, I expected better food. For lunch, they had sandwiches which the bread was stale. On the way back, they opened their bars. The price of the drinks are $6 for a mixed drink. For the price, I believe they should have offered a punch for free. Overall, I would recommend. It was a good tour but it is expensive for what you get.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Visiting Dry Tortugas National Park is a must. I’ve been twice, once by ferry and once by sea plane, with both offering a different experience. Serene as it is beautiful, the clear water surrounding the fort is great place to snorkel. Walking around the fort is also interesting because there is so much history to be learned at DT.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I went to Dry Tortugas National Park a couple of weeks ago and had the BEST time. There were some rough seas during the 2.5 hour ferry ride there & back, so if you are someone who gets motion sickness, I would take 1-2 Dramamine or something 1 hour prior to travel! The National Park is breathtaking. If you take the Yankee Freedom III ferry, they provide breakfast, lunch, use of their bathrooms, snorkel gear, a 20 minute talk about the fort, and an hour long guided tour of Fort Jefferson! I opted for a self guided tour of the fort instead and fell in love with its architecture. The ocean surrounding the Fort is beautiful and it is definitely worth spending some time on the beach in the water. I did not see much while snorkeling, but I hear that if you snorkel closer to the moat wall, there's a chance at seeing some wildlife. I love this National Park so much and hope to visit again in the future. If you're thinking about visiting - DO IT! You'll have the time of your life!","September 28, 2019",Rough seas but worth the journey!,1,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a trip on the Yankee Freedom to the Dry Tortugas National Park, and will definitely do that again! Beautiful island, interesting history, and some of the best snorkeling! Definitely take a few minutes to determine which direction the current is going before deciding to go North to South or South to North... it's very difficult to swim against the current to go from one beach to the other while snorkeling.","September 26, 2019",Definitly something to add to your trip to Key West!,15,"Madisonville, Kentucky",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We couldn’t pass up the opportunity to visit one of the most remote national parks. The fort is huge and it is so interesting to consider why they built the fort vs what it was actually used for. It was very cool to walk along the top of the fort. If coming with small children, I would stick to just the first floor—floors 2 and 3 I would worry about them falling. We did try snorkeling along the moat wall but the water was pretty stirred up that day and we didn’t see much. I think it would be great on a clear day.

Dry Tortugas National Park,This trip is expensive but worth every penny! We booked directly with ‘Yankee Freedom Ferry Tours’ and I would highly recommend them. It’s no cheaper to book with anyone else that we could find.You board the ferry early at 7.30am but a great breakfast is provided. The trip takes around 2.5 hours to get to the National park and there’s a great opportunity to spot turtles and dolphins etc. There’s plenty of seats in the air conditioned cabin or out on deck. You’re then free to do whatever you want for the day.The guide then takes you around the fort on an optional guided tour. Definitely worth doing to hear the history of it. This lasts around an hour. After that lunch is served for a couple of hours back on the ferry and again it was a great buffet with lots of choice and freshness. After that we went snorkelling after the guides told us the best places for it. There are freshwater showers at the back of the ferry and basic changing rooms on land. On the way back there is a bar open onboard for purchasing drinks. Arrived back in key west around 5.30pm.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Made all arrangements months in advance to secure camping and kayak rental. Campers arrive @ 6AM at the ferry landing to load all camping gear. On departure day-Tracy made the kayak rental seamless and loaded the kayak & provided essential safety training. The day before leaving, we mentioned we would be buying folding chairs, large plastic bin (essential for food storage while camping) & 1 ice chest for camping (& would be leaving all this stuff at our last hotel stop). She not only had the kayaks to rent but also, for an extra fee, rented all the stuff we planned on buying! She delivered the items the day before our trip so we could pack. She was easy to work with & we loved her emphasis on fun combined with priority on safety. Once on the ferry (2.5 hr), the staff was amazing, entertaining, & knowledgeable. We found out the hard way that ferry staff share tips daily. So as a camper, you interact with the ferry staff daily but if you were tipping on the return day - some staff that you wanted to tip may not be working that day! The ferry staff work hard and have so many responsibilities - even as tour guides of Fort Jefferson. The fort tour was so entertaining - we loved the pace and the information shared. AS campers- the solitude after the ferry left was incredible as the calmness of having Fort Jefferson to yourself was a one-of-a kind experience. Interaction with the NPS staff was always positive and we walked away with so much respect for those working at garden key.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Get up early and get to the dock for about 7:00am - breakfast on the boat. She leaves about 7:30 and you have a choice - get in early to the buffet or wait about half an hour and go then - it’ll be quieter. Plenty room to move around the boat and she tramps on at about 30 MPH. Get to Dry Tortugas about 10:30. Take plenty of sunscreen. Snorkelling gear is supplied free.and lunch on board after 11:30. The fort and it’s history is fascinating. To get the best out of your visit - do a bit of research. It’ll be worth it as you can’t take it all in on the day. Lot’s of ways to spend your time there and great info and tours given by the staff who were all fantastic, but special mention to “Hollywood” he was a fountain of knowledge and so passionate about the Fort. Boat leaves again about 14:30 and back about 17:00. A once in a lifetime wonderful almost spiritual experience and should be on everyone’s bucket list. But don’t wait until then - do it now.

We toured the fort - although interesting story, not exactly exciting. The reefs are gorgeous and we spent over an hour snorkeling on both sides of the island. The South Swim Beach had by far the better reefs and fish. Were a bit nervous about the small plane and landing on water but it was the smoothest ride and landing of any plane I've ever taken.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had the pleasure of camping here just one night. We had reservations for three nights but Hurricane Dorian altered our plans. The park rangers kept us informed of weather. We likely would have been fine at Dry Tortugas National Park, but our drive home thru Florida was a concern. The campsites are clean. There are pros and cons to the different sites. Shady sites: pro: there is shade which is nice during the day con: no breeze, more black flies (non biting) and more nocturnal rats skittering about. The sunny sites: pro: much more breezy at night, less rats running around you and less flies. con: hot tent during the day. Overall we were very happy with our sunny site. Compost toilets were the best latrines we have used. The ferry comes daily with day trippers and docks from 10:30 am to 2:45 pm. You can purchase ice, coctails and snacks on the boat.

This meant I got to explore Fort Jefferson with only a few other people (some people bypassed the fort to snorkel). This allowed for unobstructed access to all parts of the fort save the area where the workers and their families live and the few areas closed due to danger or work being done. There were ample signs to explain all aspects of the fort. I especially liked the cool structure used to heat up the cannon balls prior to them being shot (would light enemy ships on fire). The staff was also pleasant. The ranger I spoke with was very pleasant but Tammy in the gift shop was so helpful and informative that she made the experience even better. There are also three areas to snorkel. I tried the north pylons which is a bit more advanced but was a great deal of fun. I got stalked by a pelican and swam through a swarm of silver fish.

The provided breakfast and lunch are not so good so bring your own. Make sure you bring a hat that covers your whole head since it is really hot there. The island experience is very unique and the fort is quite interesting. Go at least once to see. Amazingly beautiful.","August 28, 2019",A unique experience,1,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We loved this trip! It was totally amazing! It was a long day but well worth it. We basically took the trip just to see the Dry Tortugas and snorkel and it did not disappoint. It was a perfect day and we got to snorkel all the way around the moat wall. So beautiful! The service on the boat was great, you are served breakfast when you board and it is buffet style get what you want, perfect! Long ride out to the island but the crew goes over all the stuff you need to know so not bad at all. We had time to snorkel all the way around the fort and still make it back to the boat for lunch, which was again buffet style for sandwiches and chips and drinks. Went back out and snorkeled some more closer to the pilings but the current was stronger there so we didn't spend much time. Showered off and changed for the long ride back. Very tired by the ride back but took a short nap and watched a video. A once in a lifetime experience for us being farmers from Illinois. Highly recommend!!!","August 27, 2019",Amazing!,12,"Elliott, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We travelled here by early morning sea plane in August 2019 and it was an amazing experience! The tour guide (Kris) for the sea plane company was so knowledgeable, friendly and funny which made the trip even better. When we arrived at the island, we were the only 8 people on it (book the early morning one for this as the boat doesn't arrive until about 10:30am) which made exploring it even more special. We essentially had a beach to ourselves for the morning to snorkel, sunbathe or wonder. Definitely worth a trip and the money if you're in Key West!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Fort at Dry Tortugas is a great place to visit. That particular state park is the least visited due to it’s location and only two ways to get there, either by boat or sea plane. That Fort too held Dr. Mud just like Fort Zackery Taylor. That’s the doctor who helped John Wilkes Booth with his broken leg after shooting President Abraham Lincoln. Anyhow. Dr. Mud was later acquitted of conspiracy and freed. This Fort too has wonderful views from the top and you can see a neighboring island with a light house on it. We took the New Freedom Vessel over to the Dry Tortugas and it was great. You’re price includes breakfast and lunch and they both were really good. Capt Meagan and her crew were great and very accommodating. Please be aware that it’s an all day affair. You leave sometime around 8 ish and return around 5:30. And the Freedom crew does provide snorkeling gear if you want. Also included in the price. The snorkeling is really good and a must to do after seeing the fort. Check it out!!","August 23, 2019",Great State Park to visit!,16,"Gloucester Point, Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the seaplane and it was FANTASTIC!! I tend to get a little sea sick, and the 2hr boat ride didn't seem very appealing, and I'm so glad we took the seaplane, because it gave us more time on the island, earlier in the morning. We got to tour the fort a full 1.5hrs before the boat (and crowds) arrived. (this was also the earliest part of the day, and the coolest) By the time we were done, we had worked up a sweat and were ready to go snorkel while the passengers on the boat were just starting their tours of the fort. What a cool national park!! I wish we would have had more time /energy to snorkel all the way around the island, but I guess that's a great excuse to come back. The beaches and water were picture perfect - seriously, so blue. .just like in the photos you see online. .","August 19, 2019",AMAZING,15,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was one of hte highlights of my viist to Florida. We booked well in advance and I was so glad that we had as it seemed that the boat was almost full. However there was plenty of space (and food for everyone). The directions provided to find both the ferry terminal and parking were extremely helpful - as was everthing on the day. We enjoyed a good breakfast on out way to the Dry Tortugas while watching the views fromt he deck. Once we arrived we opted to join the guided tour of Fort Jefferson and after lunch we spend the rest of our time snorkelling. Although a novice at this activity I really enjoyed it and was blown away by the number and variety of colourful fish and other marine life. It was, however, sad to see so many bleached and dead corals. Departure time came all too soon but on the return voyage we enjoyed the very reasonably priced bar and agian watched out for marine life - we didn't see any turtles but did catch a glimpse of a dolphin. If I ever return to Key West I will defintely revisit the Dry Tortugas but next time I will spend the night there - it was so beautiful.

Breakfast is served as well as lunch. Both were very good. Liquor was modestly priced at $5 for a margarita. Once at the national park, you are free to tour the fort on your own or with a guide.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Once at the park, there isn't much to do. They suggest bringing food and something to drink - providing you a little cooler. I understand why, the water is needed for the heat but the food will give you something to do. Once you walk around the ruins, there isn't anything else to see. It will take you about a half an hour but you are there for 2 hours. I feel the trip should be shortened.","August 6, 2019",The seaplane was awesome!,8,"Siesta Key, Florida",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I have committed to getting out to as many national parks as possible and were so thrilled to head out to this one on the Yankee Freedom. As a few reviews have said it is well worth the cost. The ride itself for us was very smooth, and I think half of our deck was lulled to sleep pretty quick. Our 4 year old was our nearly instantly. The napping portion works out well because between losing sight of the terminal and sighting the fort there is nothing but open ocean as far as your can see. Staring out into the abyss and maybe catching some sealife is a nice relaxing start to the day in my book.Getting to the island, we did the self guided tour. It might be recommended to bring an umbrella for portable shade --- the top of the fort in August was definitely warm. Walking through the halls on the lower and middle levels was quite nice though. Really cool building and history behind it. Kind of odd to me is that from the boat it looked smaller than I'd expect and then next to it it felt even bigger. Maybe the illusion of distance at sea. The beaches were nice and not too crowded even with the rest of the ferry folks. When we were on the island a small storm passed through and stirred up the water a bit so it wasn't the clearest for snorkeling, but was still nice to get out. During the storm lunch was being served on the boat so timing was about as perfect for that as it could get at least. Last thing I would say is if you're going, and going with a group, consider an annual parks card, if if a qualifying person is in your group, a lifetime senior card. Presenting it at check in will take the $15 park admission off, so for a party of 4 that's a 60 dollar savings from an 80 dollar pass. And you can use the card for the rest of the year for entrance to any national park. Boarding is by group number on cards they hand out at check in. So get in line early for a lower number pass to get your choice of the best seats. We really liked the back middle 4 of the upper deck for the trip to the fort. On the way back we got a table on the upper deck to say out of the sun and rain.","August 5, 2019",A unique must-do adventur,12,"Tulsa, OK",5

The breakfast and lunch were nice and had a pretty standard assortment of food. The tour guide and crew were very knowledgeable and friendly, and we enjoyed learning about the park on our trip over. We opted out of any of the history tours, and instead spent the majority of our time snorkeling. It wasn't the most exciting scenery that we have snorkeled through, but there were plenty of fish to see, and it was cool to be so close to an old fort.

The trip with the Yankee Freedom crew did not disappoint. Hollywood, our guide, was the most enthusiastic tour guide I’ve ever met, and I’ve been on many tours over my 51 years on this earth. He is extremely knowledgeable and a delight to have as a guide. The breakfast and lunch that was provided was delicious with many choices. Way better than I ever expected. The place is just beautiful and the snorkeling was great. If there are campers there you might want to ask them which side was the best for snorkeling. The north side was definitely better when we were there. The south side was a bit too wavy and it made it hard to fight the currents and try to enjoy the fish.

It was warm and the water was calm. You need to be there about 7am and will be back about 5:30pm. One tip, take a container for water with you.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We booked this trip well in advance after reading such positive reviews. It exceeded our expectations. From the moment you arrive at the ferry to the moment you get off, they are organized, cater to the passengers and the crew goes out of their way to do an amazing job. The 2.5 hour trip was relaxing. They serve a simple breakfast and lunch that’s fresh. They offer coffee and water for free and other drinks for purchase. Fort Jefferson was massive and the history was so interesting! We took the full tour with Adam Hollywood who was so passionate about the island, he kept us all so engaged and was a great storyteller. We also went snorkeling. The water was crystal blue and we saw tons of beautiful fish along the moat wall and the dock area. Plus we relaxed in the calm beautiful, serene water as well. We left exactly on time and enjoyed some cocktails and conversation with people on the 2.5 hour trip back. Although people mention getting sea sick, I took a Bonine to be sure so I was fine but the waters were very calm to me. The yankee freedom is super clean and it does not feel crowded.

We did manage to get onto the boat and had a fantastic day out, the ferry trip was smooth and enjoyable we saw turtles and flying fish, the breakfast and lunch were perfectly adequate. The guided tour of the fort was entertaining and informative and we felt privileged to be in such a beautiful and unique place, in the afternoon we went snorkelling, it was nice but not the best in the Caribbean.

We were on the last interior row by the front of the boat which was fine. The boat ride there was beautiful. I stood outside almost the entire time. One of the workers pointed out turtles as we rode along. The Dry Tortugas Park was HOT!! We packed our own water and refilled with the free water on the boat. We could not walk along the shore to see the birds because they were nesting, but I took binoculars. If you plan to snorkel, take your own gear. The gear provided was old and outdated.

There are three places to snorkel, along the wall of the moat which we saw the most fish, then the pile ons and the coral beds. Around the coral beds we saw sea turtles, anemones and conches.

The view from the top was amazing! The snorkeling around the moat wall was fantastic and the water and beaches were pristine. Bring an underwater camera if you are going to snorkel. Also bring something to read or do (listen to) on the way back because you'll be extremely tired. It was a long day, but well worth it!

We talked with another couple and kept each other company to pass the time. The water is so lovely, clear and blue. Saw LOTS of fish. The corals were ok we snorkeled along the moat! It’s worth the price to me to get out far into some clear water. The ship was full that day but we still had our own space on the island and didn’t feel crowded at all! Nice staff! Decent food.

They provide all food for the day and even offer drinks for purchase on the way home. Bit of advice, TAKE DRAMAMINE, if you are unsure how you will feel on the water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Dry Tortugas (“turtle”) was nice to visit. My husband and I took the sea plane over. 35 mins trip Each way and very cool way to travel over. And a lot faster than the 2+ hour each way ferry. We had just about 2 hours on the island and that was plenty of time. There are no amenities over there. No chairs to sit on. No stands to buy refreshments from. There is a HUGE fort to tour. There was a ferry docked that had brought over passengers that we could use the facilities and but food if we wanted to go onboard and inquire. The beach was nice. My husband did snorkel and saw some big beautiful fishes. Lots to see he said. I found glass on the beach (green beer bottles broken) so be careful. As we traveled by plane we could see sooo many turtles in the water below. We didn’t see any around the island. It was also bird nesting season. Soooo many birds! Very cool to see as they swarmed that part of the island we were barred from! It was a nice day. And 2 hours was plenty of time on the island.

Not sure if it was a bad day, or different expectations. South beach was better all around, but the water was not as clear as we had hoped. You need to go towards the pillars to really see coral. We did see some fish and a sting ray! Not very colorful though.There is no shade by the beaches, so plan accordingly. I suggest water shoes as the north beach was quite rocky.

The Yankee Freedom III crew, the contracted catamaran that takes you from Key West to the Dry Tortugas, were very pleasant and accommodating.

Definitely bring a book, playing cards, a video, a game, or whatever you need to stay entertained for the 5 hour round trip. If you forget motion sickness pills they sell them prior to departure at check-in. The Yankee Freedom offers fins, snorkels, and masks to use free of charge while on the island, after you sign a release form. They also offer a Free 20 minute - 60 minute guided tour with some key highlights. The tour was interesting and informative. There was enough time to eat lunch back on the boat and still snorkel after the tour. This is an amazing piece of American history and it is a must see.

The canons that are still there are truly awe inspiring (and personally, it's always a little sad for me how much we stock up to defend against ""them,"" whomever ""they"" are...). Additionally, there are a ton of informational plaques and a nice book / gift store on the island. The weather was beautiful. We had the opportunity to snorkel, but just didn't feel like we had the time (we're more history buffs than water people). There is also a nearby island that is a nesting sanctuary for a number of bird species. We weren't supposed to get too close, so we observed from the top of the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I got lucky. We arrived in the Florida Keys without a reservation for this trip which is recommended on the Frommer’s website. Fortunately there was a cancellation so we were able to book the trip. It's a long day, from about 7 am to 5:30 pm. It takes about 2 hours each way by high-speed catamaran. It was fascinating to me to travel to the start/end of the Florida Keys in the Gulf of Mexico. I highly recommend the hour-long tour of historic Fort Jefferson. It’s a six-sided building with thick, thick walls in the middle of nowhere with an interesting history.You are served breakfast and lunch on the ship, nothing fancy or elaborate. On the trip home, you can buy souvenirs, snacks, and drinks.You are provided with snorkel equipment to use on Dry Tortugas. I brought my own mask and snorkel tube. I enjoyed snorkeling along the moat around the fort and at the Coaling Dock ruins (think of a 3 x 9 grid of wood pilings). There are vibrant coral formations and hundreds of fish in and among the Coaling Dock ruins. The best snorkeling is among the South Coaling Dock ruins (head away from Airplane Beach and pass the Dockhouse). If you want to snorkel at the North Coaling Dock ruins, it is not straight-forward to get back to the Dockhouse. Ask one of the staff the best way to return. Instead of snorkeling, you can just relax on the South Swim Beach, or chat with your fellow passengers or the campers who will be staying behind when the boat leaves.","May 8, 2019",A long trip but educational and interesting,220,"Wilmington, Delaware",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I don't think you can go Key West without the trip to Dry Tortugas. It's a 2 1/4 he ferry ride on the catamaran ferry but the trip was fairly smooth. I took some Dramamine any way and was fine. We spent most of the time standing out front on the boat. Saw a sea turtle and some dolphins doing this. You could go by sea plane and get there faster. The ferry ride included breakfast, lunch, and snorkeling gear. The fort is huge and not for people with mobility issues. Tried our hand at snorkeling but wasn't darning enough to go too far.","May 5, 2019",Must do,20,"Cleveland, Ohio",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the 8 am seaplane out to the Dry Tortugas National Park. The ride is about 35 min. Grab the front seat next to the pilot if you can or at least the left side of the plane to see what the pilot sees. He pointed out Spanish galleons that had wrecked, treasures found near the wrecks, sea creatures, and other geological features. We had a bit over two hours to explore. Enough time to walk the fort then hop in the ocean and snorkel around the old docks. Perfect timing as we had the place to ourselves till10:30 when the ferry arrived. We changed into dry clothes then hopped our plane back to key west. Great way to see this place and worth the extra $$.","May 2, 2019",Go by sea plane!,47,"Vail, Colorado",4

The ticket to the ferry includes breakfast & lunch & they are good about labeling potential food allergens. We also went snorkeling- equipment also provided by the ferry.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I guess you have to go to say you've been there. So-so for handicapped. Guide said the whole place is a tripping hazard. There's a 20-min info session on the grounds, or you can stay for 40 additional minutes for a tour. We spent the approx addtl 2 hours we had there sitting on the small beach which was enjoyable. A little shade under the very low mangrove trees. If you snorkel, I'm sure it would be very nice. Boat ride gets pretty rough at times. Staff is great taking care of you. I've never gotten sick but I did. Didn't take dramamine soon enough I guess. So that kinda spoiled it for me. Breakfast and lunch - plenty of food. Lunch is make your own sandwiches. Breakfast had most everything you'd want except no hot food. Coffee was decent! Ice cream and alcoholic drinks for sale. No need to go again. Trip on boat was very long and it was absolutely and utterly freezing inside the boat. At times you could not go outside on the boat due to the rough water.","May 2, 2019",Nice,10,Virginia,3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We enjoyed our visit to Dry Tortugas so much. Half the fun was the seaplane getting there, but the fort, island, bird sanctuary and snorkeling are amazing on their own. The history of this place is incredible (still can't believe they were 1) able to construct it and 2) it's still standing despite saltwater, hurricanes, etc.) and photo opportunities abound.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The site is a National Park with a Civil War era fort - Fort Jefferson, built to support the fleet attempting intercept to intercept blockade runners heading for the Gulf Ports. Although, the history goes back to Ponce De Leon and the Spanish exploration of this area. Access is through the Yankee Freedom - a big high speed catamaran. Round trip - 4 hours. The crew is great. I had a wonderful time exploring the Fort. I am a history buff. One of the few places you can still see the huge muzzle loading cannon. Snorkeling was good - particularly in the remains of the coaling docks. If you are a birder there are species you may not see elsewhere in the US. All round, a very good time.

A 2 1/2 hour boat ride gets you here. Very good onboard snacks, great lunch, staff was fantastic with helping with snorkel gear. My regret was taking too much time to tour the fort which reduced our snorkel time. We confined snorkeling to one of the beach areas which by early afternoon was stirred up a bit and water was not as clear. My advice-snorkel all the way around the fort. Water is clearer. But an absolute must do in my opinion.","April 24, 2019",Don't miss this.,7,"Elmhurst, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our family of four, kids ages 10 and 18, camped at Dry Tortugas for two nights. Our time here was the highlight of our Keys vacation. A day trip would have left me wistful, and one night is just not enough. Staying for at least two nights ensures that you have one day without any set up or breakdown.Dave's review pretty much covers it. We were there at the same time. Hi Dave! We also rented gear from Kelly at campingfloridakeys and two kayaks from Tracy. Both Kelly and Tracy were very helpful pre-trip. Tracy's kayak outfitting included all the safety gear we might want, including radios, first aid kit, anchor and a diving bouy. Kelly provided terrific advice about packing and gear. Her camping kit was complete, and all of the gear was in great shape.We took Tracy's advice and camped in a site that was very open. Yes, we were exposed during the day. But at night, the breeze was welcome. We loved campsite Number 1. We had a great view of the fort and could watch the kids at the beach or on the moat while we were dealing at the campsite.Most campers we met kept the food to a minimum. We made the decision that we would eat lunch on the ferry each day. This was a good call and really cut down on our grocery/condiment needs. The boat buffet lunch includes fruit, deli items, chips, soda, etc. I appreciated free coffee. We also made good use of the ice water, and refilled our reusable water bottles. Cold water was very welcome.We did cook each evening and morning. For us, preparing and sharing a real meal together is one of the joys of camping. Because we didn't want to lug pots and pans, we experimented with ""foil meals."" Most of our inspiration came from Delish.com . Mornings were eggy creations and dinners were flank steak with veggies and sausages with veggies. The results were great. We even brought Florida tomatoes(which we were gifted by a friendly roadside vendor mid-Keys) and had a simple salad each night. It was fun and easy.We spent our days and evenings playing: snorkeling, swimming, exploring the fort, reading, playing cards, stargazing, telling stories, meeting other campers, fishing. Both kids enjoyed doing the Jr. Ranger program. Due to wind conditions, our kayaking was limited. We were able to paddle out to Long Key and to take in the Frigate nesting and see many other species. The early mornings and evenings, pre and post day-trippers, were magical. Our kids were not bored! We loved the fact that there is zero cell reception, as we were not competing with media and could get a break from the dreaded daily ""screen time negotiations."" We didn't have any rat issues, but we did put away water and kept food up.Bring sunscreen. Lots of sunscreen. Bring hats/coverups. It is sunny out there! Yes, it is ""primitive"" camping, but this is basically car camping. As mentioned, the bathrooms were in great shape. They are much nicer than many of the ""pit toilets"" you will find at other parks or primitive camp sites.Our kids loved this trip and so did we. If you are on the fence, go for it! It was worth every penny, minute and extra planning time.

Having the island only accessible by boat and sea plane, we felt like we had it to ourselves.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Not many people can say they've visited Dry Tortugas National Park as it is one of the more remote attractions. It's an investment, both in time and money; however, in my opinion, it's entirely worth it. The ferry ride itself was very pleasant with friendly staff. My only complaint about the boat ride would be the speaker system is very loud/blaring. We opted for the 20 min tour which was informative enough and chose to do the self-guided tour following so we could explore at our own leisure. Even though the ferry seems packed, once on the island, everything is so spread out that it's not nearly as congested as you might fear. By walking the entire top of the fort, we were able to see that nearly everyone was on one beach but only one family on the other, smaller beach. Once we finished exploring the fort, we ended up heading to the smaller beach and we had it entirely to ourselves!!! for about 20 minutes until another family joined. I would definitely recommend visiting Dry Tortugas!","April 20, 2019",Once in a Lifetime Adventure,22,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I are big history buffs and study the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Going to Fort Jefferson, the place where four of the Lincoln assassination conspirators were imprisoned, has been on the bucket list for many years. It took a great deal of planning and preparation to get there and to get all the supplies we needed from Maryland, but was totally worth it. We camped out on Garden Key for three nights (the max the Yankee Freedom ferry allows) and wish we could have stayed longer! There is so much to do there that you really have to camp for multiple days to take it all in. Those who only come out for a few hours on the ferry or seaplanes are really missing out on the key experience Dry Tortugas has to offer. Once all the day trippers leave, it really is a magical time with just you and the few other campers. The sunrises and sunsets are phenomenal as are the stars on a clear night. We rented a kayak from Tracy in Key West and enjoyed paddling around the Fort. It was a bit windy while we were there which prevented us from heading over to Loggerhead Key. The fort is massive! We enjoyed walking all around the inside and around the top with breathtaking views of the water. Snorkeling was a blast though the higher winds made the water a bit murky on a couple of the days. During the spring, the park is also a big draw for birders who want to view the migrating birds and those that lay their eggs on nearby Bush and Long Key. We learned a lot of new facts about the different bird species from the kind and knowledgeable birders who camped alongside us. The park rangers and gift shop employee were all very nice giving us advice and answering our plethora of questions about the fort. If you're a fan of history, snorkeling, and just getting away from it all on a beautiful beach, the Dry Tortugas is a must visit place.Here is some additional advice for campers:* Don't let the idea of primitive camping scare you, it's really not as bad as it seems. My wife had never been camping before in her life and still loved it. When the ferry is there you can use their bathrooms which have sinks so you can wash up. When the ferry is gone, the composting toilets on the park are well maintained and don't really smell. Our campsite was right near the bathrooms and we never smelled anything. You will probably get hot and sweaty, but a nice dip in the cool water is very refreshing.* It's important to remember that the ferry boat is docked there everyday from 10:30 - 2:45 pm. They sell bags of ice for $7 each so you can replenish your coolers whenever you need to. If you bring your own ziploc bags to transfer the ice into, you'll have nice cold drinking water as the ice melts. We brought two 5.5 gallon jugs of water with us out to island and never even touched one of them because we had cooler water to drink from the melted ice. * While there are rats on the island, neither my wife nor I saw any during our three night stay. They are nocturnal and so if you are in your tent after dark you'll probably never encounter them. Still, it's important to pack your food, water, and trash in hard plastic containers.There are also posts you can hang trash from that keeps it away from the rats. The ranger told us that sometimes the rats can chew through the flimsy gallon sized jugs of water you can buy at the convenience store but the 5.5 gallon Reliance Rhino Pak jugs we brought were perfectly fine sitting out all night. If you use common camping sense and keep all food and water in hard shell containers outside your tent, the rats won't bother you at all.* You probably won't eat as much as you think. We packed way too much food. While there are little grills on a post that you can use with self-lighting charcoal, we were fine with the food in our cooler and other prepared foods that didn't need cooking. You are going to be having so much fun enjoying the Fort and the beaches that cooking is the last thing you'll want to do.* Bring headlamps for the nighttime. This may be common sense but our headlamps were way easier than having to use flashlights when the sun went down. Having our hands free in the dark made a big difference.* All campsites are not created equal. Check the weather condition before you go to see how windy it will be. The only times we were miserable was the first night when the winds were low and our tent got quite warm. We had chosen a campsite with ample shade and, while this was nice during the day, at night the trees blocked some of the much needed wind. While the trees provide a sense of privacy during the day, you want to wind at night even more. If you're going during a period of time when it won't be very windy, we'd suggest investing in a portable fan of some sort to help keep the air moving in your tent. When the air stops circulating at night, you can get real sticky and uncomfortable.* If you are flying to Key West or live outside of Florida like we are, make things easier on yourself and rent your gear from campingfloridakeys (dot) com. The owner, Kelly, gives you everything you need to set up camp. They drop off your supplies to you at the ferry terminal on the day of your departure and pick them up when you get back. She also allowed us to pick up the cooler we rented from her the day before so we could get all the food packed ahead of time. I'd recommend you get the chairs and beach umbrella along with your gear. Many of the day trippers wished they had my chair when I was sitting out on the beach.* A lot of reviews on here mention Marty as the guy in Key West to rent kayaks from. We had originally contacted Marty and reserved our kayak with him but he has since retired from the business. He recommended Tracy for our kayak needs and she was great. Give her a call at (207) 907-6105 or tracystravelingkayaks (at) gmail (dot) com if you're interested in renting a kayak to take out with you. Tracy gave us a lot of great advice on the morning of our departure.If you're thinking about camping out on the Dry Tortugas, just do it. You will not regret it.","April 19, 2019",Camp here.

I took my time not realizing that those that ""checked-in"" earlier got the earlier boarding numbers - yes, they board by number. The number you get is where in line you checked in.

Dry Tortugas National Park,There are some pros and cons in visiting this important historic site. My wife and I are history and nature fans so it appealed to us and we are glad we went. The pros are you get a very thorough and enthusiastic guided tour of the southernmost historic fortification in the Keys and get to see a bird nature preserve with a nearby beach for swimming and snorkeling. The tour includes a continental breakfast and sandwich lunch. The cons are you need to plan your trip at least two weeks in advance with on-line purchase. This trip is in demand and usually sells out. The ferry ride to and from the Dry Tortugas is four hours and if you are a birder you cannot explore nearby Bush Key during nesting season to get great bird pictures. You are limited to see them from afar with binoculars. All in all worth the trip for us even with the small inconveniences. ,"April 13, 2019",Unique Historic Site to Visit,286,Florida,5

We snorkeled around the moat wall and walked around the fort on the inside as well. I have to say that the half-day flight was not enough time to do everything that I wanted to do. I wish I had a chance to snorkel the pylons and to walk around the top of the fort, so if we were to do this again I'd go a whole day. I'd also recommend a rash guard as it is really hard to get out of the wonderful water and sunscreen is damaging to the reef.","April 12, 2019",Beautiful park,4,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Ok, if you are looking for a location to get away from it all, this is not the place. There are boats coming in and out. There are sea planes coming in and out. There are helicopters coming in and out and there are generators running 24/7. And with this comes many people that overcrowd the very small island. So it is like Disneyland for much of the day. When they are gone for the night it is better as all you can hear is the generator running the remainder of the time. What we did find very nice and awesome was the water, snorkeling and the night sky. We brought our kayaks and had a wonderful trip to Loggerhead Key. Best snorkeling around!! The snorkeling near the for was ok but Loggerhead was excellent!! Please don't go because of the birds as you are not allowed to go and see them. What a disappointment. And the stars at night are pretty awesome too! Not as good a Utah, but very nice. The fort is just ok. Nothing much important ever happened there and looks to be a total waste of money to build, but it is large and you can look around. So if you like snorkeling, hermit crabs, large crowds, generator noise, and blue water, this is the place for you!! Would recommend coming with your own boat so you can stay longer and get around better to hit the best snorkeling locations.

Dry Tortugas National Park,This was a big item on the bucket list for me. We went on the Yankee Freedom and it was a beautiful day for the boat but my husband is very prone to motion sickness so the 2 and 1/2 hour ride there and then back was hard on him. The crew was great and gave him ginger ale on the ride out. They let him stand on the dock until the last minute on the way home. Breakfast and lunch are both included. The food is okay and gets you through the day. I loved the boat ride and thought it was very smooth but I have no issue with motion sickness. So if you have that issue you need to know it can be an issue. Also staff said that they go out everyday unless the weather is extremely severe....like a named tropical storm or worse. Once at the National Park you can tour Fort Jefferson. It is huge and very interesting. If you can snorkel....make sure you leave time for it. We went out around the pilings and there were tons of fish. We saw huge barracuda and plenty of tropical fish. The day we were there the visibility was outstanding. As we were on the dock getting ready to board the boat to return we saw a big shark chase a fish up to the shore. It is amazing what you can see. It is a must do. So glad we made it there. Even my husband has no regrets even with the sea sickness.,"March 27, 2019",Bucket List,79,"Clearwater, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We purchased our tickets before the US Government shutdown, and luckily, the park was reopened by the time we went in early Feb. 2019. Well worth going to understand the history of the fort. Ferry ride was no issue either way. Ferry crew were great, and the weather was perfect for walking on the protected beach and snorkeling. My friends had the Park on their bucket list, and we agreed it was one to remember. You can even camp on the island if you preregister.","March 27, 2019",Island National Park,0,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,The park is well worth the 2.5 hour ferry ride each way to get to the park. Our kids had fun exploring the fort and playing at the beach. Exploring the fort is a good hot day activity since much of it can be done in the shade. Coral reef snorkeling was underwhelming. Maybe the hurricane last summer wiped out some of the coral. ,"March 26, 2019",Well Worth the Trip,25,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"WOW! Everything from the crew and the ride to the island itself, you WON'T be disappointed. Wonderful views, very accommodation crew -- Hollywood, our guide, was incredibly knowledgeable, easy going and SO helpful. Everyone was there when you needed them and then no where to be found when you wanted to explore on your own. We traveled with three little ones (2, 4 and 6), and brought some little containers of play doh...LIFESAVER for the long rides. Also invest in Dramamine before you go--it's preventative and worth it. The snorkel gear was perfect, I wish there was better visibility, but not much you can do about that due to weather conditions (choppy/wind). We saw a barracuda, a nurse shark, and then a little baby sea turtle off the bow as we were taking off to go back. Water is CRYSTAL clear. You get back in to port RIGHT in time for some dinner and sun set celebration at Mallory square. The whole trip was just perfect and was the HIGHLIGHT of our entire vacation.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Having the dubious honor of being the least accessible national park, the dry tortugas are not easy to get to. The 2 hour ferry is your least expensive option at $180/person. This requires a reservation well in advance, especially during peak tourist season. There are limited other options: seaplane (2-4 times as much) or taking your own boat. That said, the park and the fort are well worth the trip. The fort is well maintained (given the frequency of hurricanes). The tours provided by the ferry company were excellent but you have plenty of time to explore the 3 levels of fortification on your own. Snorkeling is a popular option on the adjacent beaches though the waters were a little rough on our visit and we did not take part. Camping is also an option to those who reserve well in advance.","March 23, 2019",Excellent remote national park,13,"Copenhagen, Denmark",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were a little anxious about taking such a long boat ride to get to the island, but the experience was absolutely worth the trip. The Yankee Freedom vessel ran smoothly but once we go to the Dry Tortugas National Park we really had great time. The fort is incredible and the snorkeling was unbelievable. Don't expect to see too much in the way of large fish/sea life, but the rocks and pylons (posts?) are teaming with small sea life and tropical fish in crystal clear waters. Pictures cannot do this place justice. With the somewhat limited number of people who can physically access the island, we also never felt crowded while snorkeling or exploring the fort- which is not something you can say of every beach/reef in the Keys.As far as our time on land goes, we debated giving up snorkeling time in order to take the extended tour of the fort. I'm glad we did. The tour was extremely entertaining (for history buffs and casual tourists alike) and the tour guide (Hollywood) was among the best I've ever seen. You'll still have plenty of time for getting in the water and soaking up the sun, so this tour is well worth your time. Final notes: Bring sunscreen as shade on the island is limited, underwater cameras are worth bringing, and the island is home to amazing seabirds for anyone interested.","March 21, 2019",Worth the Journey and Don't Skip the Tour,10,"Greeley, Colorado",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The National Park itself was very cool. It was an amazing place to see since it is 70 miles off the coast of Key West and you can only get there by ferry or sea plane. (The ferry is about a 2-2 1/2 hour ride each way with 4 hours at the Park. The ferry ride on the Yankee Freedom was fine and I reviewed them on their own page. Note that they are a separate entity from the actual National Park). When we were planning our trip to south Florida we made sure to fit this in because we aren't sure we'll get the chance to go another time. Fort Jefferson is a spectacle to behold, you can go into the fort and up to the second and third (top) level to get different views of the Park. There were also signs around that gave information on what the different places in the fort were and what they were used for. We do love to snorkel, so I will admit that the snorkeling was a bit of a let down. There was not all that much to see and the visibility was not great. We heard the snorkeling was great and so were a little disappointing by that, there was some fish and coral, but nothing overwhelming or in any way amazing as far as snorkeling goes.","March 19, 2019",Definitely something to check off the bucket list!,5,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We left on the Yankee Freedom out of Key West at 7:00 am for a 2 1/2 hour - 70-mile boat ride to Fort Jefferson at Dry Tortugas National Park. They boat served breakfast which was much more than expected; ham, boiled eggs, cereal, bagels, toast, yogurt, orange juice, coffee, milk. The ship, a 110-foot catamaran provided a comfortable ride. As we approached the Fort could be seen rising from the water. Construction on Fort Jefferson began in 1846 to protect the vital navigational waters between Key West and the fort and from the fort to Mexico. The 60-minute narrated fort tour was great and extremely informative. Lunch was then provided on the ship; several choices of cold meat, various breads, fresh fruit, salads, water bottles, and a selection of pop (Soda)After lunch allowed almost three hours to explore the fort or snorkel in the clear waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Masks, snorkels and swim fins are provided with the cost of the boat fee.On the return trip we saw dolphin swimming alongside the boat. And the boat offered two cash bars.It was on our bucket list and we were pleased it was one we could check off.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I agree with the other positive comments in the recent reviews so won't repeat them. This trip is a wonderful way to spend a day while you are in Key West. You do need to reserve this excursion at least several weeks in advance, as it usually sells out. The 2-hour ferry ride to the Dry Tortugas can be extremely bumpy for about 1/2 of the trip (mid-trip, where the water is deepest, according to a crew member); anti-nausea medication is strongly recommended for EVERYONE (many ""white bags"" were handed out on our trip)...in fact, they recommended that you take a 2nd dose of anti-nausea meds after lunch, before starting back!!! They do sell Dramamine for $1/dose in the ferry terminal. The ferry ride includes buffet breakfast (bagels, eggs, fruit) and lunch (cold cuts, salads, fruit, cookies), as well as hot drinks (and soda for lunch). The food was plentiful, fresh and tasty. The guide for the tour of the fort (""Hollywood"") was exceptional...he was an engaging speaker - insightful and well-versed on the history of the area. Take the extended tour that he offers. There is time to walk around the island on your own, or snorkel (pretty chilly on the day we went out, but quite a few people did snorkel - equipment included in the tour price). There is a small national park store in the fort, but no bathroom facilities on the island itself (4 restrooms on the ferry). On a hot day, this might not be everyone's ""cup of tea,"" (it's a huge red brick fort)...we went on a day when it was about 72 degrees; it was lovely and breezy. The cabin of the ferry is air-conditioned; you can get on and off while at the island. The interior cabin has a number of tables, so you can play cards coming and going- not much to see for most of the ferry ride. They also show some relevant videos en route to the Dry Tortugas. Seniors can use their National Park Pass to get an additional $15pp discount when they pick up their tickets at the ferry terminal (in addition to the discounted senior rate at the time you purchase the tickets).","March 19, 2019","A Very Bumpy Ferry Ride, but a Wonderful Overall Experience",10,"Laurel, Maryland",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I took a half-day seaplane trip out to the Dry Tortugas and really enjoyed ourselves. The flight was about 35 minutes each way and flew at about 500 ft. above the water so you could see sharks, dolphin, sea turtles, and shipwrecks quite easily. It also provided some of the most beautiful views of Key West, the Marquesas Keys, and the Dry Tortugas and Fort Jefferson. Once you land you can change into swimming attire, though I'd suggest you wear it under your clothes on the way out and beeline for the Fort and take about a half hour looking around. Then I'd head to the beach and go snorkeling for about an hour, then change before heading back on the plane. I think the full day would be too long for me, but the half-day was a bit short and didn't permit us enough time to go in the Fort. We did see some pretty amazing fish, sting rays, eels, and even a barracuda while snorkeling! Definitely bring sunscreen, a hat, longsleeve UV sunshirt, and wet suit booties for walking on the ""beach."" The beach there is allllllllllll crushed coral -- very little sand -- so walking on it in bare feet is excruciating. Even the ""sandy bottom"" is really crushed coral so getting out of the water is difficult as well. Going by Key West Seaplane Adventures, they give you a little cooler with 4 drinks (for 2 of us), and even provide fins, snorkel and mask. We brought our own full-face snorkel masks and just used their fins. You must pay an additional $15 in cash for your admission into the park (even if just snorkeling). It was one of the most ahhhhmazing excursions I've ever taken!The only downside... There are no ""real"" restrooms on the island. There are some compostable toilets you can use when the ferry is not at the dock. When the ferry is in, they shut those toilets down and you must use the ferry bathrooms (even if you took the seaplane over). After getting dressed, I thought I'd use the ferry restroom before I headed back to our seaplane, only to find the ferry pulling out. The compostable toilets were about a five minute walk out and back but would make me late for the plane since they were in the opposite direction. Thank heaven I didn't really have to go that bad, but if you do, make sure you allow plenty of time to get there and back to your plane and you know the ferry schedule!","March 6, 2019",Get Wet at the Dry Tortugas National Park!,11,"Houston, Texas",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,We love National Parks and this one does not disappoint. Starting with the only negative: website and boat representative suggests parking garage at a cost of $32. Website says $19 but we were told the price went up and to expect to pay $32. When we got there we saw a closer parking garage closest to the dock for $14. Parked without a problem. Next day we called the office and innocently asked about the parking costs as if we were going on the trip the next day. Again we were told a specific parking garage at 300 Grendel street and that the cost would be $32. We confessed that we were there the day before and asked why they don’t recommend the one closest for$14. The agent became curt and defensive saying that the garage they recommend is manned and secure and that they can’t vouch for the other one. Come on - that is total BS. The National Park shouldn’t endorse the boat company on this charade. Shame on themBUT - the day was glorious. Perfect weather for a boat ride- great snorkeling - and the fort is fascinating.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had been told we needed to visit this fort, Fort Jefferson, on the Dry Tortugas and did book a sea plane ride out to it. It turned out to be one of the best things we did all week while in Key West. the booking was thru our hotel Concierge at the LaConcha hotel and it was a well run avaition adventure with a super pilot, Gary. He not only knew what he was doing but made it fun and even played his own music list while enroute. We flew from the KW airport and landed in the water just off the fort and taxied to the beach, where he helped us off the plane. Only takes about 35 min to fly there compared to the 3 hours plus on the ferry. lot more expensive but well worth it for us. Gary showed us sights all the way out and back including an old shipwreck. total time to do it all is about 4 hours and we flew out in the morning. We did not snorkel but a lot on our plane did and seemed to enjoy it greatly. It was February and the water was warm enoght to get in and snorkel. I recommend walking the fort, which you can do around the top, almost all and around the moat, which also you can't quite do the full loop. Storm Irma took out a small part and you can go mostly around it and back. Can be windy so bring a jacket or long sleeve. hat and sunglasses for sure.We really enjoyed it and would do again if ever back in the Keys.

The destination is awesome, Fort Jefferson in’s a lot to take in. The snorkeling is just so so, but it’s fun to get in the water and it is super easy to gear up and down. Food is good in transit. The only “bad” thing I would say is the the aggressive pitch on tipping at the end. Guy at the bottom of the gangplank with a bucket? Cmon guys! Besides, who carries cash?

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We flew out to Dry Tortugas on the first flight in the morning. Plane only holds 10, so make reservations well ahead of your trip. Every one get a window seat, and you fly low enough that you can watch for sea life and ship wrecks. It only takes 1/2 hour to fly out there, the ferry takes 2 1/2 hours. We had the while fort to our selves during that time. Some of our group planned to swim/snorkel while and the float plane company provided the equipment and coolers if needed. You have 2 1/2 hours on the island, just your small group and you might see a ranger or two that live there. The fort is a self guided tour with plenty of signage and walking paths. It was so quiet you could almost hear the history. Either way you get out here, it is well worth the trip. One of the few hard to reach National Parks. There is Dry Camping available on the island.

The staff briefed the passengers on the trip, (what to do if you feel sick, etc). The trip was 1.5 hrs, we got off at the fort and one of the staff gave a free tour. They serve breakfast and lunch on the boat. The staff is VERY attentive and professional. The breakfast included hard boiled eggs, Bagles, ham, cheese, fruit, yogurt, milk on, coffee or tea. Lunch was 3 different breads ham, chz, chicken salad, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, potatoe salad, chips. Sodas are supplied. The fort has beach access, some people snorkel, (they have equipment). The park allows primitive camping, the ferry transports your gear. There is not enough time to snorkel and tour the fort, if you don't want to feel rushed. Alcoholic beverages are offered after the departure from the fort. It was an enjoyable day.","February 9, 2019",Fun,20,,5

Fort Jefferson is amazing - the largest masonry building in the Western Hemisphere. It's a photographers delight. We wandered around the fort using the self-guided tour, and we spent quite a while bird watching. Snorkeling was fun although not that flashy (no huge coral reefs). And the food was perfectly adequate and casual for breakfast and lunch. We're very glad we went.

Then you can explore on your own while there or tour with someone learning all about why the biggest fort ever built at that time was put there. Very cool story that I won’t spoil. Also included is snorkel equipment and this place looks like a place for a photo shoot with bright turquoise water and white sand beaches.

The boat ride is very long, and half of my day was spent simply riding on the boat. The fort itself is interesting, but you do not need much time to explore it. Of course, the beaches around the fort are beautiful to look at, but there are beaches all over Florida. The beaches of Dry Tortugas would not be a reason to make this long journey from Key West. We were provided four hours to explore the island; two hours would have been sufficient. The staff of the ferry were great, very helpful and knowledgeable. The ride over was not smooth sailing and a few people were getting sea sick. Definitely use the motion sickness meds available to you if this would be a problem.

Go by seaplane and make the trip in a half day.Fort Jefferson is the only reason to go there (beaches and water are readily found everywhere in the Keys). The size of the fort is awesome and the blood, sweat and tears (literally) that it took to build it were shameful, especially since the fort was never completed and never took part in a battle. Of course, the fact that it was there and formidable may have had a part in the latter.Go there for the history and for a fine example of what humans can do in the face of adversity.","January 24, 2019",Fascinating Part of American History,3,"San Antonio, Texas",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We debated taking a sea plane in order to have more time at the fort, but you really don't need it. Save your money and take the ferry (unless you get seasick). Since admission is limited, you will never feel crowded in the fort or at the beach, even with a full ferry docked. We took the ferry, which had a pretty smooth ride out. We didn't know that breakfast was also included in the price. You can leave your bags behind a seat as you walk around the boat, but you can't leave them on the boat after you dock. However, you can leave them near a bench or tree and nobody messes with it. Everyone has to return on the ferry so even if someone did steal it, you'd be able to find them again. There are 2 changing stations (stalls) at the dock for you to change into a swimsuit later. There are no bathrooms at the fort - only on the ferry. Lunch is also provided and the price is included in your ticket. You only need some cash for beer ($5 per can) or souvenirs at the gift shop. We toured the fort in about 1.5 hours by walking around on our own. It's a great view and some cool sights to look for, but you can't walk around the whole thing. Some sections are closed off. It's mostly empty inside.Then we had lunch and went snorkeling. The beach along the fort wall had little fish, but the coaling dock ruins had a lot more to see. We still had plenty of time to snorkel both locations, and dry off a bit before heading back to the ferry.The ride home was pretty rough due to a cold front coming in, but it smoothed out a bit once we got into deeper waters. We saw some dolphins and sea turtles along the way.","January 23, 2019",Cool fort and beautiful beach,23,"Detroit, Michigan",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We him hawed over whether to fork out the money for an excursion out to the dry tortugas for sometime and finally opted in, as we probably will never be back to Key West again (not that we wouldn’t like to). It was a beautiful plane ride to and from the island, however we were not so lucky to see any sharks, dolphins or sting rays along the way. Once we arrived, we had about 2 1/2 hours to explore. We walked around the fort, and explored the beaches. We saw lots of hermit crabs and sea shells, but not much else. It’s worth noting that bc this is a protected national park, you can not remove any shells from the island.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the seaplane out to the park and are glad that we did. It's more that the ferry but worth the views and it takes only 40 minutes instead of 2+ hours on the boat. We flew at only 500 feet each way so we could see any sharks or sea turtles below. On a recommendation we booked the afternoon flight because the ferry would be gone and there would be no other tour groups to bump into. The fort is amazing in its construction. You can walk around nearly the entire fort and island. There is a self guided tour that you can download on an app that will tell you all about it. If you have the National Park pass, entrance fees are not charged. The seaplane trip leaves you on the island for 2 and a half hours which is plenty of time to see the fort and even snorkel for a few minutes.

It was a choppy boat ride and too cool to swim without a wet suit. I was pleasantly surprised they were open during the Goverment Shutdown. They contract with a third party for both the transportation and tours. Dramamine was a life saver. Others who thought they could tough it out were not so lucky.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had some apprehension about the visit during the government shutdown. However, everything was open - visitor center, gift shop, and rangers. Perhaps this is because so many live here in homes cleverly hidden among the fort's ruins or because of immigration and drug-running interdictions. I noticed that some rangers were packing side arms. And the all-important stamp for your NP passport was available! Touring the fort is OK, but walking the beach is better for seeing shells, coral, and, especially, birds. There were lots of frigate birds soaring about and up close. You can also snorkel, although we did not as the days was windy and cool. There are campsites, but you have to bring everything for your needs including water as the Dry Tortugas are dry - no fresh water.","January 15, 2019",A remote and interesting national park,692,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wow! Our visit to the Dry Tortugas has been the highlight of our trip. What a hidden gem with so much history. We booked with the official tour company who operates the yankee freedom ferry to the park. This is a big day and absolutely worth it. You check in at 7 am and board at 7.30 am departing at 8 am. A buffet breakfast is served onboard. Consisting of boiled eggs, deli meat, cheeses, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, orange juice, tea and coffee.The ferry trip is about 2.5 hours so suggest you bring something to read or do especially if you have kids. There is no cell phone coverage! The Dry Tortugas is incredible and surrounded by crystal clear water full of sea life. If you want to snorkel you complete a waiver form and are provided snorkel gear and you are away. Lunch is served between 11 am and 1 pm. It’s a make your own sandwich buffet and was great. With chips, cookies, bottled water and sodas. There are two options for tours at the fort. The first is a 20 min educational talk to find out a little more about the fort. This is at 11 am. The second option is at 11.30 am and takes 45 mins to 1 hour and you visit key areas of all three levels where the guide explains all about the fort and tells you about its history.Either way I highly recommend either the talk or tour. We took the tour and loved it. Our guide David was excellent. I suggest signing up for the talk or tour as soon as possible when sign up sheets are available as numbers are limited. After the tour there is still plenty of time to continue exploring the fort, to snorkel, swim or just enjoy beach time. The snorkelling was great. We went all the way round fort and saw loads of fish and beautiful coral.All aboard time is 2.45 pm with departure at 3 pm. A cash bar is open for the trip home and you can buy drinks and snacks.It’s a full day but absolutely fantastic. A must if you visit Key West.

The Fort is worth exploring, although it's easy to get turned around in there. Climbing to the top was rewarded with beautiful views.The water was cold for me, but a few friends did snorkel.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom to Dry Torugas on 1/8. The water was stunning, snorkeling was so much fun and Fort Jefferson was a site to behold! Libbie and Tim were knowledgable and pleasant during the trip to and from the park.Now the catch. The Yankee Freedom is the ONLY company that can take money and travel people to the island. That means most of us will need to use their service. The fee is $180 per person with about 165 people on board. During the trip they showed videos prepping us to tip them, did a 50/50 raffle to raise money for themselves and then proceeded to sit at the exit ramp with a large jug asking for more tips. To add to my frustration I listened to the crew being asked how much the guest were drinking and they should encourage more for more money. So disheartening. I left feeling agitated and wondering why my entry fee was not good enough for them to share their knowledge as they went through a days work.Good luck and enjoy the trip! The island is amazing!","January 9, 2019",Beautiful with a catch,10,,3
Dry Tortugas National Park,Extortionate price for a long and dull 2 and a half hour ferry ride with basic breakfast and lunch.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My son (age 12) and I had a fabulous day visiting this unique National Park. We traveled on the Yankee Freedom, which includes breakfast, lunch and snorkeling gear in the price. We both love history, so we opted into the longer tour, which was excellent. Walk the top of the fort, as well as the beach. The snorkeling was great, too. We also saw beautiful frigate birds. A really awesome trip while in the Keys.","January 1, 2019",Perfect for beach lovers and history buffs,8,"Ojai, California, United States",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,Fort Jefferson and Dry Tortugas NP is an absolutely gorgeous site. The fort has so much history and there is so much to explore.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We have done many national parks, and choose to visit Dry Tortugas because it’s uniqueness in both location and what it offers. We had such an amazing day....it did not disappoint. We didn’t have time to snorkel, as it was important for us to really learn about the fort and for our kids to do the junior ranger program. But, we did spend a bit of time at the beach, and the water was amazing!","December 23, 2018",Great day!,7,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Although I have been to Key West many times this was my first excursion and we were thrilled we did it and booked with Yankee Freedom. The ferry ride was easy and the crew were so helpful and accommodating. Our guide for the day Hollywood was engaging and extremely knowledgeable. His passion for the fort and the Dry Tortugas was genuine and he ensures all of his guests have a good time. The history and the sheer engineering aspects of the site are many. It is a unique day trip and the amenities onboard from the food, toilets, and fresh showers accommodates all. And the coral reef around the moat provides a great Snorkeling experience. Don’t park in the City parking garage for $32 go a bit further down the street to Coral parking for $14.","December 15, 2018",Fantastic day trip,48,"Louisville, Kentucky",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We really loved the sea plane ride to Fort Jefferson on Dry Tortugas National Park. The ride itself took 32 min. and was very smooth. They provided us with life jackets for snorkeling at the island, and will provide you with snorkel gear if you want it. They also gave us some water for the trip. Be aware there is a $15 per person charge (cash only) to visit the national park which they collect. During the flight, we were able to enjoy incredible views of the ocean below, including the area where they continue to search for treasure from the Spanish Galleon, Attocha. You will also see a sunken ship used for target practice during WW2. Narration or music continues throughout this flight. We did the half day tour which was 4 hours long, and in our opinion, all you need.. We explored the fort on our own, and then snorkeled next to the fort. We saw many lobsters in the wall crevices. Not much else, however, as the water was pretty murky. We arrived about 10:30am just about the same time as the ferry which takes about 2 and a half hours from Key West. One guy on the ferry returned on the sea plane with us because he was so sea sick from the ferry crossing. While the ferry is in port you are asked to use their restrooms, as the ones at the fort will be closed. Food was only available on the ferry and it served a very small buffet of cold cuts and fruit for $7 per person, until 2:00pm when hot dogs and hamburgers were then also available. However, we were departing before 2:00pm. There is no other food for sale on the island. There is a ranger talk at 11:00am which we missed as I was unaware of it. It would be nice if they posted that info. The fort movie was not shown that day as the DVD player was broken. Overall, we enjoyed the history of the fort, and the sea plane ride to Dry Tortugas National Park. We were able to do this tour as cruise ship passengers in port for one day.","December 13, 2018",Signature Aviation Sea Plane to Fort Jefferson,51,"Manhattan Beach, California",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This trip has been on my bucket list. The trip to Fort Jefferson was enjoy. The historical and engineering aspects of the site are many. Downloading the information from the website is a good primer for exploring the site. Dr. Mudd’s cell is a must stop from the historical perspective while walking the top and gazing the vastness of the surrounding ocean emphasizes the remoteness of the fort. Nature and time are taking a toll on the structural integrity and appearance, but that adds to the uniqueness of the fort. Snorkeling gear is provided and there are beaches for swimming. A good day trip with a nice breakfast and lunch provided onboard the transit vessel.","December 12, 2018",Bucket List Trip,39,Florida,5

I am prone to seasickness and took 2 Dramamine and did fine, but if the seas had been rougher I would have been miserable. The boat serves a solid breakfast and lunch and then opens the bar for drinks to purchase on the ride home. A couple of things: we did not think the underwater sights were that impressive, having snorkels in some pretty amazing places, but we were told Hurricane Irma had damaged the coral.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I boarded the Yankee Freedom II for a full day excursion 70 miles off the Keys to Dry Tortuga National Park. The water was indescribable in color and clarity! There were several beaches and bays to snorkel and if you wanted, could work your way all around the Fort! The fort itself is incredible considering the conditions the soldiers and civilians had overcome to build it. The heat and sun is blazing, so sunscreen and a hat is a must! Consider long sleeves as well. The ride out and back was two and half hours each way, so if you are prone to motion sickness, take your dramamine! Once you arrive, you could take a quick guided tour or wander on your own, which was what we did. The photo ops are endless here and the history is worth the read. Stop in the small visitor center and say hello to the park ranger, they have 10 day rotations on the island! Buy a National Park patch or other momento but bring cash and small bills to boot! If you are so inclined, you can plan ahead and tent camp here for a few days, we were told by an adventurous camper that the stargazing at night was amazing!The staff on the Yankee Freedom II will serve a tasty lunch and at 2:45pm promptly, you are headed back to the Keys. We saw some wildlife on the way home including a hammerhead shark, close enough to the boat and surface of the water to identify!We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend it for all ages.","November 15, 2018",A day spent in Paradise!,4,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped on the Tortugas for 2 nights and loved every minute of it. We read up on what to bring and what to expect and that saved us. We rented kayaks when we booked our passage on the Yankee Freedom III and the was glad we took them. There is so much to explore on such a small island. The fort is amazing, but you need to be prepared for a lot of walking on uneven ground due to the age of the fort. There is also no guardrails or anything to stop you from falling if you are on the second or third floor. Wear comfortable shoes, flip flops aren't great for walking the fort.When not exploring the fort, snorkeling is a must, the water is beautiful and there is coral and fish abound. We also loved it when the boat and sea planes were gone and the island was just the handful or campers and the park employees. Camping is very primitive with composting toilets and no water. We read up about the rats that have been on the island forever and live in the tree that is in some of the sites. We just made sure we put all our food in hard bins and hung our trash on the poles in the site, in bags they provided us. They didn't bother us and we didn't have any issues with them. There is also hermit crabs that live in the base of the tree. We loved watching them and they became our nightly entertainment. The employees at the park were very informative and helpful. There is a small shop in the fort, but take cash just encase the wifi for the shop isn't working. With the island being so far out, there is no cell service. This park is a must see.

If you go with the tour guide, you won't get to enjoy the entire island. I walked to the farthest point and the water was beautiful. Snorkeling was excellent in both places!

Although I was expecting to see way more ocean life around us & only saw a few different species of fish, but it was still worth it for the 1 time.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"For those who think Key West is the Southernmost part of the USA, think again. If you have the money, take a flight out to Fort Jefferson and spend the day. If you are a camper, take the ferry and spend a night in a tent. It’s in the middle of nowhere, if you are one that loves to escape. I dropped my brand new Tommy Bahama hat in the moat, which sunk to the bottom when the Park Ranger tried to use a fishing rod to get it out. Please return it if it ever resurfaces. I wanted to jump in to get it until the ranger told me the moat was used as a toilet for all those years people lived on this rock in the middle of nowhere. It’s appropriate really because the government built this monstrosity of a fort that was obsolete the minute it was finished. So I guess it isn’t just my hat that got flushed down the toilet of Fort Jefferson. All joking aside, however, it is really worth a trip out there if you want a very unique relaxing experience with a great mix of history.","October 23, 2018",Government Spending At It’s Best,11,"Key West, Florida",5

During our walk we were the only people up on top of the fort, the stairwell wasn't easy to find and was harder to locate when we wanted to come back down.

Breakfast and lunch are included in the trip, but you can also bring your own snacks and drinks (another thing I didn't realize beforehand).

Even though you only have about three hours there, or less, it’s a beautiful place to see. Because access is so limited, you really feel like you’re away from all the tourists. On our visit bush key was open so we were able to sit on a basically private beach even though we couldn’t get in the water. The Fort grounds themselves are beautiful as are all the surroundings.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"As the tour guides will describe, this place probably should not have ever been built, But, it was, and there isn't much else to do with it except open it up to tourists to look at. The swimming is OK; the snorkeling close in was average, except for the 5' baracuda that seemed to love saying hello to swimmers. Food offering is limited so bring anything you want over and above sandwiches. A lot of walking but good scenery mixed in with bumpy trails. Takes a lot of time to get there and home (about 2.5 hours each way) so bring some good reading material.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited the Dry Tortugas via the Yankee Freedom and enjoyed (nearly) every minute. The crew was very helpful and informative, friendly and thorough. The trip out to the Tortugas (which takes approx. 2 1/2 hours each way) was very comfortable and included a continental breakfast which was serviceable. Youre not making the trip for the food, though. The real treat is reaching your destination and hitting Garden Key beach. We began exploring Fort Jefferson on our own. It is an amazing piece of history; there is an organized, led tour but we didn't want to spend that much time touring. There is also a self-led tour available for download, which I would recommend if you want to have plenty of time to snorkel, which is what we wanted to do. So we set out solo and explored the fort then went back to the ship to eat lunch (sandwiches, chips, cookies and soft drinks) to get all that out of the way before snorkeling. This was a great plan for us. We started out on the beach to the right as you exit the Yankee Freedom. The sea was quite stirred up that day and we did not encounter many fish while snorkeling, although we did see some beautiful hermit crabs under the foliage on the beach. So we headed over to the other beach, on the other side of the fort and found tons of undersea life there, particularly along the rock wall. The beach there is also quite spacious and the swimming/sunning area was perfect. The water was so many shades of blue! We enjoyed every minute and only wish we had more time to spend there.On the trip back to Key West, the seas were ROUGH; many people were seasick, so be sure to bring some Dramamine and take it well before boarding. The closer we got to Key West, the calmer things got and we were able to enjoy the ride more. The crew was prepared for the rough seas and was very attentive and caring to all the passengers. This was a beautiful day and a truly excellent adventure! ","October 12, 2018",Simply Wonderful!,4,"Edmond, OK",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This place is AWESOME!!! My girlfriend and I went for the day on the Yankee Freedom. It's a little expensive but mostly worth it. Long boat ride but very serene on the water. Its about a 2.5 hr ride. They have breakfast on the boat on the way out. Did not participate because I had breakfast before we got there. When you arrive you can either go on a guided tour or make your own tour. We walked around ourselves and it was still interesting. Great pictures from the top of the fort. Only wish you could actually go into the lighthouse. Maybe it was just closed when we went. Also they show this other island that is somewhat attached, you also can not go onto that island. Looked fun to hang out on but maybe was closed that day also because of the storm that just passed. After the tour or before you can go snorkeling. My girlfriend and I tried the snorkeling on a different all day adventure last year and did not like it at all. But we figured we would try it again this year. Very glad we did. It was amazing seeing all the sealife around the fort. Got some good pictures and held a living conch. Would probably do it agian if it wasn't for the long boat ride. You could also go camping out there overnight or for 3 days. Which to me seems very creepy. But overall it was a great trip. Definately recommend!!!","October 5, 2018",awesome!,1,"Ohio, Illinois",5

Dry Tortugas National Park, While the history was interesting I didn't find the place to be near as beautiful as people had written about. I had no idea we had a National Park that was practically inaccessible. The boat ride each way was 2.5 hours which they did explain ahead of time. You can get a pass to camp for a few days but heard the wait is long. We went tho on the heels of hearing of a family member getting some very serious health news so I'm sure my 'lack of enthusiasm' has more to do with that than the actual experience.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I can’t describe this place in enough words. First of all the Yankee Freedom ferry was fabulous. That’s a whole other review. If you decide to make this 3 hour calm boat ride MAKE SURE YOU CAMP AT LEAST ONE NIGHT. You will be sorry for not witnessing the immaculate sunset and sunrise. You will not see that riding the ferry in/out on same day. The turquoise blue water during mid day in clear about 30-40 feet down beaming with tarpon, angel fish, parrot fish, yellowtail, pin fish, and the list goes on. While snorkeling on a day trip or camping trip —From the camping beach follow the moat wall directly out into the ocean. Do not fear; it doesn’t get that deep. Aim for the white buoy out in the distance. You won’t go that far. On your way you will swim up upon a huge natural coral wall teaming with hundreds of species-fish, live queen conch, lobsters, turtles. It took us less than 10 mins to get there with flippers and only 5min back directly to beach. We floated out and explored about 45 mins. I wish I would have camped 3 nights instead of 1.

It's a unique place but the fort wasn't all that interesting and the snorkeling we did around the fort was not nearly as good as what we were able to do further up the Florida Keys. When you factor in the 5 hour round-trip, it's a lot of work to get to something that I just wasn't that impressed with. The area you are allowed to snorkel in was not a reef but just along the edges of the moat wall and the coal shoals. We did see some fish and a stingray but no turtles and the visibility wasn't great even though it was a sunny day with calm water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"As a birthday gift, my husband and children took me on a trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park. In order to get there, you have to take the Yankee Freedom ferry (unless you dish out more $$ for a seaplane). The worst part of the trip is the very early morning start time. You have to be at the dock by 7am and that makes for very grumpy family members. The lunch provided by the ferry, Yankee Freedom, when you arrive, is quite nice. Once docked the crew sets up for the day and then puts out the lunch. We found our spot out on one of the beaches and then went back to grab the food. They serve a variety of meats, cold salads, sliced cheese, tuna salad, a nice selection of sandwich breads, chips, cookies and drinks. You can eat on the boat or bring your meal onto the island - just make sure you throw your trash away properly.Once on the island, 2.5 hour ride to get there, you are welcome to snorkel, explore, swim, float, or whatever. Move and decide quickly because the day goes by quickly. The island is small and there are no amenities. There is a salt water hose to rinse sand off before boarding the ferry again and there are changing rooms. The ferry has fresh water rinsing showers where you can rinse off before returning to the island to change. You can bring your own snorkel gear or they can supply equipment for you. We snorkeled so much that we never even went into the fort that the island is famous for. You can explore the entire moat from the inside the water on the outside. There are tons of fish, and lots of colorful coral growing on the outside underwater part of the moat. We saw huge sea urchin, colorful fish and some really huge fish within small sections of the moat that had been damaged by hurricane Irene. The fish had found there way through the holes in the wall. Further out from the moat others saw barracuda, spiny lobster and larger fish. Water shoes are not necessary but there are spots that are rough on the feet. The scenery was stunning on the sunny day we were there and the color of the water was gorgeous. There is not much to do but explore and relax. Bring EVERYTHING you need for the beach. There is almost no shade so an umbrella is a great idea. We brought our beach blanket, towels, chips, and snorkel gear. I noticed others had beach chairs and still more passengers were coming to stay overnight and had camping equipment with them. But with NO bathrooms or fresh water on the island, be prepared to rough it. We brought a cooler, but with the lunch provided, didn't need our own food. The ride back is more relaxed and quiet since everyone is tired. There is food for sale, the kind you get at any snack bar including ice cream bars, baked pretzels, corn dogs, etc. We got all 6 of us seated together at a table on the way back and played games. Bring a deck of cards and you're in business. There is not much else to do. A lot of napping from the day in the sun.","September 1, 2018",Paradise and relaxation,66,"Pembroke Pines, Florida",5

A day round trip boat ride is available from the Dow town Key West Harbor. The seaplane ride was very cool, the views were stunning. The tour of the fort is interesting with lots of insights. There is time to swim, snorkel, and enjoy the beach. Pack a lunch, drinks, enjoy. Be sure to check out the gift shop. A bucket list sort of thing, by seaplane, fairly priced, shirts and t-shirts, sunglasses, hats, and very easy and safe.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were very lucky to travel by seaplane to this magical island. If you can afford it, its the best way to go! Once the ferry left then it was just the 12 of us on the plane, left on the whole island. My husband and I went snorkelling around the fort and then just chilled on the beach until the plane came back to collect us. Its like being in paradise. Unfortunately you only get 2.5 hours on the island, but it was enough to snorkel, swim in the sea and just relax. The company provide all the snorkelling gear you need, so you just have to turn up and look for the fish, of which there were many. This was a really fabulous experience for us and we really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend it as a holiday highlight.","August 26, 2018",A magical experience,15,"London, United Kingdom",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"While in KW, we booked the trip to Dry Tortugas. Was it expensive? Yes. Did it take a long time to get there by boat? You bet. Was it a fantastic use of the better part of a vacation day? ABSOLUTELY!They feed you breakfast and they feed you lunch. They tell you about the islands and Fort Jefferson and when there, the time is all yours. Go snorkeling, check out the Fort, or just hang at the beach. The snorkeling was just ok, on the north side of the island, but that is the rougher water, too. I suggest bringing games or cards or a newspaper, something to make the time getting there go quicker.I also recommend booking the trip before getting to KW, as the trip was booked all week the week we were there.Have a great time there!","August 25, 2018",Dry Tortugas and Fort Jefferson,3,"Brookfield, Wisconsin",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,By far the highlight of our trip. Honestly the reason we went back to Key West was just to visit this place with so much history.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the ferry to Dry Tortugas and had an excellent time! The boat ride was long (2.5 hours each way), but the weather was great, the view beautiful, and we met some very nice/fun people while on board. They served a continental breakfast buffet (simple but fresh; cheeses, meats, hard boiled eggs, breads, fruit) enroute. We did take Dramamine (just to be careful) so we did not have any problem with seasickness. Once at the island, we put our backpacks down and went snorkeling along the moat wall. Aside from the variety of coral, there were many different types of fish to view as well. We had our own equipment, but you could use the boat's gear if you needed to (included in the price). After snorkeling for over an hour, we went back to the boat to grab lunch; there was salad, fruit, cheese, lunch meats, peanut butter and jelly, bread, cookies, soda and water. Picnic tables were available outside or you could eat in the air conditioned boat cabin. After lunch, we toured the fort and its grounds - simply amazing and historical, and all with spectacular views! Be warned that there is little, if any, shade on the beach, so you may want to bring an umbrella…sunscreen is a must . You also cannot leave bags unattended on the boat, so whatever you bring you must take with you. We felt comfortably safe leaving our backpacks on the grounds while snorkeling and exploring the fort. (BTW, if you have the money to spare, there is a seaplane that can take you to the island in far less time than the ferry.)","August 25, 2018",Worth the day trip!,119,"Somerset, New Jersey",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Visited the Dry Tortugas on a friend’s boat. The perfect place for adventure sailing, diving, and history. The reefs, coral, wrecks and wildlife deliver some of the most beautiful diving in the US. But, this type of trip is not for the faint hearted. There is no public potable water, or flush toilets, or medical care, or marina, or tow boat service, or decompression chamber. The coast guard is not nearby if you run into trouble. If you are going it alone on a private boat, be sure to bring plenty of water and first aid supplies. Follow conservative diving guidelines and all safety procedures.

However you get there, it is a one-of-a-kind adventure where you truly feel like you are at the ends of the earth. The ruins of Fort Jefferson are neat to explore, and the snorkeling and beaches are wonderful, even for those who aren’t very experienced. It is a bit primitive, so be prepared for that, and while we’ve not done it they do allow camping. It’s just a truly neat place to visit.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were lucky enough to get the last two seats on the ferry, late in the afternoon on the day before the excursion. During the busy tourist season, I would recommend planning ahead to ensure you are able to get a reservation on the desired date. The Yankee Freedom III has two levels of seating, both indoor and outdoor. Some shade is provided with the outdoor seating. The number of reservations accepted allowed for a few extra seats around the boat. We enjoyed the ability to freely move around and not feel cramped or crowded during the 70 mile; 2.5 hour ride to /from Dry Tortugas.Upon arrival we enjoyed touring Ft. Jefferson at our leisure. The self guided tour signs were very informative. Followed by about an hour of snorkeling before washing off the sand and going back on board for lunch. Lunch could be eaten on board or taken to one of the many picnic tables provided on the pier or between the pier and Ft. Jefferson or on the beach. After lunch there was plenty of time for more snorkeling, touring, changing into dry clothes, or simply relaxing.The breakfast buffet offered a wide selection of traditional breakfast foods, including boiled eggs, hot and cold cereals, ham, cheeses, breads, bagels and cream cheese, with juices, milk and coffee. We opted to have lunch close to the end of the designated time and there was still plenty of tuna salad, hummus, peanut butter and jelly, lunch meat and cheese, chips and cookies. Condiments included tomato slices, romaine lettuce, pickles, Hellman's Mayo, mustard and ketchup. Three types of bread were offered. I may have forgotten some items, but needless to say there was something offered for every type of diet or taste.Several people did not return to Key West with the boat, instead they came prepared to extend their visit by staying in the primitive campground. There is no fresh water on the island and only chemical toilets for use when the Yankee Freedom III is not docked. It appeared that all equipment was inspected before being allowed on the boat. Be sure to know the rules for camping if you are thinking of staying overnight. The return to Key West included an open bar with very reasonably priced alcohol drinks, soda, candy and snacks. The staff was friendly and helpful.We would gladly go on this excursion again. ","August 18, 2018",Excellent way to spend a day!,12,"Columbia, South Carolina",5
Dry Tortugas National Park," Took my young adults on the Yankee Freedom trip. We hate getting up early but this is worth it. In Port terminal a staff member kept us informed of what we needed to know. On board we were surprised at the variety of items offered for breakfast. The boat was sold out but we did find 3 seats together. The drone of the boat can lull you to sleep. Information is played over the speakers from time to time. We passed one of Mel Fisher's treasure hunt ships in the sea. Snorkeling is included in the trip. Listen close to the instructions. I saw one flying fish. Others saw dolphins. If you don't want to watch the ocean for 2 and a half hours, bring a book or some post cards to fill out. We brought Dramamine but none of us needed it for sickness. The boat sells it for only a dollar a dose if you need it. Music is played over the loudspeakers for most of the trip. If you don't like Jimmy buffet bring some earplugs. The captain narrated some things we came across as we neared the destination. On the island with fort Jefferson we took the hour long tour of the fort. Amazing that such a giant structure could be built out in the middle of nowhere. Lots of cool tidbits of information about the history here and the people who built it. You can go off and on the boat all day on the island and use the bathrooms or enjoy the very nice lunch that was provided.The inside of the ship is air conditioned and quite comfortable. Strugglers are cautioned not to touch any Coral in the water as it could damage it. There's also something called fire Coral.It does not always look like Coral and comes in different shapes. And if you should brush against it as one of us did you will be stung as if a jellyfish got you. Not fun. It can look like moss, seaweed, Coral, or leaves, tricky stuff this fire Coral. The three foot barracuda stayed near me for a while under the water. I realized he may have been attracted by my shiny silver watch band in the sunlight. and a 5-foot Tarpon just glad it passed me. The fish don't seem to be scared of you and your snorkeling. Really cool.Most of us were pretty tired on the way back and cut a few Z's.. This trip is not cheap but you get your money's worth and it's a long boat ride out there. There are also options to Camp here if you make plans through the park and the Yankee freedom. We noticed that the seaplane comes and goes from here a few times a day if you have the extra money it's much quicker.","August 18, 2018","History, Beauty, and Breakfast",4,"Palmetto, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The fort is pretty cool to see. We had a cloudy day for the most part which made it cooler but harder to see in the water. Even with pretty smooth waters, sand was kicked up by small waves and so that also contributed to it being difficult to see anything. The currant was really strong pulling us back to shore and so we could not make it out to see the coral reef, which is a bit farther off shore. We were really disappointed. I would say unless perfect conditions need to be a moderately good swimmer and have experience snorkeling to get out to see the reef.

Dry Tortugas National Park," There was not enough time to enjoy all the beauty in this little place! We took the Yankee Freedom boat to Dry Tortugas. The boat ride is a little over 2 hours each way. The boat offered a pretty good selection of breakfast foods on the journey to the island. On the trip there, you have a chance to sign waiver forms for snorkeling as they offer free snorkeling equipment. Once we docked you were able to do your own thing which included: touring the fort on your own or following the hour long tour, or swimming or snorkeling. We chose to do the tour. The fort is very beautiful and the views from the top are amazing. Once we finished the tour we went back to the boat for lunch. After lunch there was time to go swimming and snorkeling.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took a trip aboard the Yankee Freedom III last Saturday. It was a wonderful ride out to the park. A little over 2 hours. Breakfast and lunch provided as part of your tour. We had 4 adults, 2 teenagers, 2 kids and 1 toddler in our group. We had a huge discussion about taking an umbrella stroller so we would not have to tote the toddler. Location is not too friendly for this. You have to climb to the mid level and top level of the fort to see everything. Maybe a backpack or sling would be better depending on the child. You can go with the guide or do a self directed tour of the fort. If you are going to snorkel and see the fort, you need to plan and move out when you get there. It is a gorgeous place, beautiful views of ocean. Lots of history to learn. I've been told the coral is not as pretty as it was before the last hurricane. It is still very interesting for me, the novice. Would love to some day camp and/or kayak there. If you take the Yankee Freedom, you have to be back to the boat at 2:45 pm for the ride back to Key West.

Good for all members of your group...walkers, birders and other nature buffs, primitive campers, snorkelers. I cannot say enough good things about it. If you are not lucky enough to own your own seaplane or ocean going boat, take the Yankee Freedom catamaran out of Key West or a seaplane from the Key West airport. Both are nice and give you about the same time on the Tortugas. The seaplane is pretty trilling and gets you there and back quicker, but the boat ride is a pleasure with breakfast included....a bonus is you go close to where the Atocha shipwreck was found.Oh and one other thing the name Dry Tortugas refers to Dry = no natural occurring fresh water on the island and Tortugas = turtle or tortoise for the sea turtles you often see near the island.

The beauty of Garden Key and the water are the real attraction. (60 miles west of Key West) I've gotten there by both methods. If you can afford the airfare, it's worth the extra cost. The ferry ride is about 2h 15m, and on a nice day it's quite nice. The plane ride is 30 minutes, and you can stay longer beyond the time the ferry departs with all its passengers. The ferry was carrying 175 passengers the day we went.As far as the ferry, the Captain and crew were pros, and ""Hollywood,"" the main tour leader, gives a very complete overview. Hollywood gives a 20 minute overview (do not pass this up) and an extended 1 1/2 hour guided tour.The ferry provides snorkeling gear, breakfast and lunch (simple buffet style breakfast and sandwich board lunch with soda/water) If you already snorkel, bring your own gear. The snorkeling here is actually quite good. Also pack any extra goodies you like that might not be on a typical concession stand menu.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our epic 3 night/4 day camping experience at the Dry Tortugas National Park is one that will always bring back beautiful memories.We rode the ferry ""Yankee Freedom III"" 70 miles out of Key West to Garden Key the home of Fort Jefferson. The trip itself was amazing and the crew of the Yankee Freedom III were very accommodating and first rate. As you approach Garden Key you can see firsthand how big the fort actually is. The third largest fort built by the USA Fort Jefferson is magnificent and truly captures ones imagination.The weather was perfect and we spent MANY hours swimming at the lovely beach less that 50 feet from our campsite. The camping is primitive (you have to pack in your own water) but the Yankee Freedom III is in port every day from around 10:30am to 2:45pm so you use their ""flush toilets"" and you can rinse with a fresh water shower off the stern. You can even have lunch on the ferry every day from 11:00am to 1:00pm for around $7. You can rent snorkeling gear from the ferry as well (free). The guided tour of the fort by Yankee Freedom III crew is very interesting...our particular guide was ""Hollywood"" who gave an excellent tour!The snorkeling was great on Garden Key and we saw several huge tarpons and a grouper that was at least 5/6 feet long!We rented a tandem kayak from ""Marty"" in Key West (the crew on Yankee Freedom III know and recommend Marty for kayak rentals as he provides everything you need...life vests, radio, anchor, dry bag, dive flag, etc.). We paddled the 6 mile round trip to Loggerhead Key and spent the day diving the ""Little Africa"" reef. The snorkeling on Loggerhead Key was amazing and we were able to view some colorful tropical fish and hard and soft coral. We were also treated to a great display of hungry pelicans soaring and diving as we sat on the beach that we had all to ourselves...all day!The island is busy during the day with folks who come out for the day on the ferry...but once they leave you have the island practically to yourself! Every night we would take our chairs to the wall that surrounds the moat and we would sit and watch the sunset and enjoy until the stars made their debut. Since there is almost no light pollution on Garden Key the stars are breathtaking! We came to the Dry Tortugas in July as the waters are very clear at that time and trip out/back is normally smooth. This is a trade off as it is very hot in July!The best part of the trip was the feeling of complete freedom...no cell phones, not computers, no hectic schedule, not time constraints...we wore our swimsuits 90% of the time and if we got too hot, we would just hit the beach and swim to our hearts content.This special place is amazing and I recommend it to all who seek an island adventure.The fee for the ferry is pricey...but considering the 140 mile round trip and the experience it is worth every penny.Most important things to bring: Swimsuits, sunscreen, water & hat.We will be returning to this lovely place one day and I hope you will be able to experience the Dry Tortugas as well.","July 16, 2018",Camping and Kayaking at the Dry Tortugas National Park an epic adventure!,28,"Sanford, Florida",5

You can take their tour or download the info to your phone and go it alone, which is what we did. It is stunningly beautiful and rich with history. This is a must see, no matter how you get there.

We were able to walk to the front of the boat to see the water. There wasn't much to see except open water. The boat was large and very stable which made for a pretty smooth ride. Fort Jefferson was really neat and we all enjoyed walking around it. There were a few areas to snorkel which were enjoyable, although not anywhere near comparable to some other reefs in the keys.

We took a seaplane over to the island from Key West and arrived in 30 minutes.The flight was pricey but worth it. We spent 2 1/2 hours roaming around the structure and the island. We weren't allowed to enter one part of the park because birds were nesting. It was interesting to learn the history behind Fort Jefferson and its part in the Civil War. There isn't a lot of shade nor any amenities so be prepared before you take a boat or plane to this island.

Do yourselves a favor take the Dramamine even if you don't normally get seasick, the crew spent most of the trip passing out and collecting vomit bags, and it wasn't much fun for the rest of us watching sick people that you hoped wouldn't hurl on you. The views are beautiful from the top of the Fort but there are no railings and the steps up are very narrow and curving I would be concerned taking small children or older adults. As for the Fort itself, if you have seen on Civil War Era Fort you have seen them all, in fact there are three on Key West all very similar. Because of the wind the water clarity was not good for snorkeling. The beach and swimming area is small. The lunch was basic, the crew though were outstanding and informative.

The snorkeling was a lot of fun and there are a lot of fish to be seen around the outer wall of the moat and the old boat dock poles on both sides. If you're on the fence, go.","June 28, 2018",Totally worth it!,17,"Bonaire, Georgia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,This is truly a dont miss location and in fact worth the trip to Key West in and of itself. Boat ride out is a bit bumpy but just take your dramamine and brave it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,I traveled to the Dry Tortugas National Park and it was jaw dropping. The water is so aqua and crystal clear. The coral reefs are colorful and filled with many fish. The only thing that was a little scary was the large barracuda I saw while snorkeling. If you are like me (I’m afraid of sharks and barracudas) I would recommend staying in the shallow snorkeling areas and make sure there are other people around you. Otherwise than that the Dry Tortugas is a trip i will never forget!,"June 27, 2018",Stunning Serene National Park,17,"Tampa, Florida",4

We took the 20 minute guided tour of the fort (but they did offer a longer tour for the history buffs) and then self toured the rest. The highlight of the trip was the snorkeling - if you go make SURE and snorkel around the dock ruins around the North or South beach - I saw more variety and larger numbers of fish than I ever had snorkeling in the Caribbean. On the trip back the crew had snacks/drinks for sale. It was a fantastic trip and I would definitely do it again!,"June 27, 2018",Who knew this was out there!!,11,"Tignall, Georgia",5

We saw some nice coral on the old piers and along the moat wall along with parrotfish, sergeant majors, and other colorful fish. The boat ride was long but smooth. The time on the island was a lot of fun.","June 26, 2018",Dry Tortugas,32,"Olathe, Kansas",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is quite an adventure. Take tge seaplane and maximize your time! Boat ferry takes too long. Make your reservations in advance and try to get the 2 p.m. flight if you can as the boat tourists are leaving when you get there. You will have the place to yourself. Recommend spending a half-hour touring the fort and the rest of the time snorkeling in the waters where you will see amazing fish. Snorkel gear included with plane ride. Go to the Northern or Southern piles and snorkel in that area. Absolutely stunning views on the plane of the water, sharks, hundreds of turtles, and flying fish. Well worth the money. If your time is limited in Key West do not bother with a boat, just pony up for the seaplane. The guide also points out shipwrecks and other attractions in the water and the area.

Lunch was also included in the fare, and we were invited to return to the boat any time between 11:00 and 1:00 for lunch of simple sandwiches, and fixings. All this for less than $200. The day on the island was fabulous, Magnificent Frigatebirds, Brown Noddies, and Roseate and Bridled Terns escorted us in as the captain eased us gently into the dock, and we disembarked. The boat provided snorkeling gear to anyone who wanted it. Our goal was birds, but snorkeling in the crystal-clear water was very tempting.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I would say my time at the dry tortugas was just okay. The day starts by checking in before 7:30AM. Upon arrival you are presented a numbered ticket that tells you what group you are in for boarding. The later you arrive the higher your boarding number will be. Boarding begins at 7:30AM and the boat takes off at 8:00AM. The staff members are very friendly and helpful. They serve free breakfast, which are bagels, boiled eggs, fruit, and different assortments of cereal. The narrator is very thorough in explaining everything. He provides details for how the day will run. The boat ride to the Tortugas is 2.5 hours, which sounds like a long time, but if you bring something to read or take a nap its not that bad. After about an 1.5 you lose all cell phone and internet service so beware of that because its a remote island. The trip there is beautiful as you see the water change different colors at different points in the ocean. Once, arrived the the island you have option of bird watching, snorkeling, laying on the beach, or walking around Fort Jefferson. BEWARE depending when you go it can be VERY VERY HOT HOT HOT HOT!!! IT was so hot because the sun is beaming but there is no shade on the beach and the heat from the sand is bouncing up. The sand is HORRIBLE. Its not smooth at all. The sand is sooooo rocky. So please bring swim shoes and a hat to black the heat. There is no shade so bring an umbrella. The water is cool and feels great. The water is sooooo cleared beautiful. The trip back is actually nice because you are so exhausted from the day that all you want to do is sleep. I gave this trip a three star because its so hot and the beach is not comfortable. TIPS: 1. Bring a hat, probably a flopped hat  2. Bring an beach umbrella 3. Bring LOT of water 4. Bring LOTS of sunblock you will need it for sure 5. Wear swim shoes.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This fort is truly a unique stop while you're in the keys and I would urge you not to miss it. You can arrive via ferry, private charter, or seaplane and explore around the island. I choose the ferry which was sold out so I had to physically wait first thing in the morning to see if anyone cancelled or didn't make it in time. Lucky enough we were able to go. The ferry ride is over an hour which is a good time to get some shut eye. They did have a breakfast on the boat ride over. Once you get to the Park it is not huge. You have options to snorkel, go to the beach, wander around, take a tour of the fort, or even camp out overnight. It was very hot and humid so I imagine camping out would be pretty rough. I would say a day here is more than enough to see and do everything. It's a pretty cool picture spot and the water has beautiful colors. The snorkeling was ok, you do see a decent amount of fish. It is a bit expensive to come here but for a unique experience I think it is worth it. Make sure to take advantage of the full day if you do make it out.

The tour guides (Hollywood in particular) were enthusiastic and seemed to enjoy their job on the Ferry that transports you between the Fort and Key West.

Getting up at 5 a.m. to be loaded onto the ferry by 6 a.m. was a little tough, but after that everything was excellent. The Yankee Freedom staff provided great customer service. The park staff was knowledgeable and helpful. Bring a hat and sunblock because the sun is pretty relentless. The camping area is small, but felt more private than bigger places I have visited. We borrowed snorkeling gear from Yankee Freedom when we arrived and were able to keep it until we left. When the ferry departed at 3 p.m., the island got very quiet. And after the last seaplane departed that evening, we dozen or so campers had the place to ourselves. The snorkeling was amazing -- we saw barracuda, parrotfish, cuttlefish, and dozens of other fish. Watching the sunset from the fort's brick moat was exceptional. We spent hours on the South Beach watching the stars come out and tracing satellites across the sky. The highlight was seeing the Milky Way sweep across the sky.

It’s a 2 hr boat ride on The Yankee Freedom. A nice comfortable boat with a happy, talkative crew. Fort Jefferson is an amazing historic fort and I think everyone should see it once.... go on the tour. A primary reason we wanted to go was the amazing snorkeling we had read and heard about. My experience was it was not good. I understand weather has a large part to do with it but even taking that in effect there is very little corral and minimal fish to see. Bring a water bottle.

Unfortunately our trip was during an unusual cold spell, so we did not get to enjoy the swimming or snorkeling here, but we found plenty to explore in the park to fill our time there regardless. I can see why people choose to stay overnight here. Fort Jefferson was amazing and it's crazy to think about how difficult it would have been to build, especially considering it's location.

Yes.. .the moat; and you couldn't snorkel there. Other than Fort and Snorkeling, not much more to do but work on your tan. You can camp there, but unless very easily amused I can't imagine it as much fun. No stores, shops, or services of any kind; so pack well unless you want to take a 3hr boat ride for a supply run.

We could have taken far more time at the Fort. There is snorkeling in the area. I went. But since I didn't go too far out, I didn't get to see too much. I was disappointed that there wasn't much of a Visitor Center at the Fort. And no Rangers. Would have like that.But an interesting place.","May 28, 2018",It's Way the Way Out There,323,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,A long ferry ride (2 1/2 hours each way) and then the park service only allows you to stay there for 4 hours (the ferry drops you off around 10:30 AM and you need to get back on the boat by 2:30. With lunch and exploration you only have around 2 hours for snorkeling. A good trip but if you just want to snorkel there are closer spots from Key West. The contractor that runs the official ferry is first class though-- very organized with a decent breakfast and lunch on board. But 5 hours for a 4 hour stay is not a good payoff.,"May 28, 2018",A beautiful isolated island,16,,4

It was expensive and hard to do as we were flying with camping gear from Dallas... but both felt it was totally worth it. It’s far different than the car camping. Seeing the sunset from what is basically a deserted island will be an experience I cherish the rest of my life. I’m not sure I would recommend the day trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I planned a trip to Dry Tortugas for her 40th birthday and didn't regret a moment of it. But know this: There are only three ways to get to the island (Garden Key) with Fort Jefferson and the national park: a 2-hour ferry, a 40-minute seaplane or your own private boat. We had two days planned in Key West and set aside a day to visit by ferry, but a week before our trip, we were informed that the ferry had to be taken out of service for maintenance. I quickly booked us on a seaplane (at twice the price and for half the time), but it was still the experience of a lifetime. Sure, we had to walk through the fort (inside the walls, on top of it, across the parade ground in the center) more quickly and spent less time snorkeling, but we wanted to make sure we experienced as much of it as we could. Not having ferries running actually meant that only about two dozen tourists (two seaplanes' worth, plus a few private boaters) were there when we were. It was a much more private experience. Alas, we took home no souvenirs -- the gift shop was closed because of some computer problems, even though it's cash only.When planning this trip, we figured it would be a once-in-a-lifetime thing ... but we've talked about going back sometime -- and taking the ferry so we can bring a tent and spend the night on the key.","May 21, 2018",A life-changing experience,14,"Clifton, New Jersey",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,A must if you go to the Keys. We took the Freedom III Ferry and booked online. The staff and tour guide were amazing. The snorkeling for a novice like me was unbelievable.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It's a bit of a long ride out to the park and on a bad weather day I can see it being dicey. They called the seas moderate but we had no ill effects either out or in, nor did we see anyone on board in trouble. I would worry about that forecast. The day was overcast but we got burned, easy to make the mistake with no sun but use sunscreen if you are susceptible. Park was interesting with both history and beaches, snorkeling was ok especially by the walls of the fort. Not the greatest, but I have been on trips and seen much less. Breakfast and Lunch were nothing spectacular however it would be unfair to expect gourmet, it was nice they provided something at all. Next time I might bring my own and enjoy something nicer. I think the experience is well worth a one time trip, not sure if I would ever go again.","May 20, 2018","Cool place, everyone should do it once.",8,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is a national treasure and wonderful place to visit with friends and family. The Yankee Freedom ferry is well organized and clean with a friendly crew. Hollywood was a wonderful host. The park is situated on a small island with a bird sanctuary. Ft Jefferson is a great place to walk around, but for us snorkeling was the most fun thing to do with clear water, many varieties of brightly colored fish and corals. I do not recommend this for babies because the trip is longer and their aren’t services available for babies and the sun is strong. Toddlers are okay. Well worth visiting this national landmark.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"By all means, if you are going to Key West, try to allow an entire day to visit this park. It is fairly expensive, but you are going on a large National Park boat 70 miles offshore and the price also includes a nice breakfast and lunch. This was the highlight of our visit to Key West. We had a wonderful tour guide -Hollywood- who taught us an incredible amount of history about Fort Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas Natl Park. Some in our group chose to go snorkeling, but we did not. We took the 1 hr tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. We spent the rest of our time walking around the island. We were able to see marine life in the moat around the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Park itself is beautiful. Even with the all boats and planes visiting you can find a spot and be by yourself. BUT It is not worth the 2.5 hour boat ride out and back. It is a loooooong ride. If you chose to go, bring earphones and ignore the boat schtick as it is difficult to hear and exceptionally cheesy. Also pack your own bfast/lunch/snacks, food provided is abysmal. However, drinks are cheap to purchase. If you have a beach umbrella bring it as there is no shade unless you stay in the fort itself.","May 15, 2018","Park is a 5, Journey is -10",17,NYC,3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was a beautiful place to visit and would be ideal for camping. For a day trip though, it was a bit too short of a time onshore. the ride out to the park is about 1.5 hours (same with ride back) so be prepared to spend a lot of time on the Ferry. When we were there the storms had caused the waters to be a bit muddled so we did not see any fish when snorkeling. I would definitely suggest that if you go; bring gear, food and water to stay a few days!","May 15, 2018",Beautiful spot for a camp or a picnic,1,,3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our family is trying to visit all of the national parks, so off we went to Dry Tortugas. This was an amazing trip in every way -- the fort has great historic value, the water is amazingly beautiful, and the day was so much fun! We took the ferry over (about $175 per person), and the ride takes around 2.5 hours. Your ticket includes breakfast (a buffet including cereal, yogurt bagels, fruit, cheese, boiled eggs, etc.) and lunch (make your own sandwich with several meat/cheese/bread choices, fruit, potato salad, soft drinks). The only downside is that there isn't enough time at the island. You will have to make choices and prioritize how you spend your time while you are there. There is a 20 minutes quick intro to the history of the park, and there is a more comprehensive tour that is a bit more than one hour. Here area few observations that might be useful:1) There are changing rooms on the dock when you arrive, but there are only two and they are very sparse -- I wish I had worn my bathing suit with clothes on top.2) There are fresh water showers on the ferry, but you have to shower on the ferry and then get back off to change in the changing room on the dock. If you don't mind riding back in your swimsuit, you can do that.3) Be sure you have a jacket for the ferry ride!4) Time on the island is really limited -- if I had it to do again, I would skip the talk (it was really interesting and only 30 minutes, but I think I could have read online to get that information--if you are there mainly for the historical interest of the park, then the longer tour would probably be something you would enjoy). I think that to maximize time on the island, it might be a good idea to eat lunch as soon as the ferry docks -- everyone else will be rushing to get off the boat and you will avoid lines that will likely have formed if you come back later. When you have finished lunch, you can leave the boat and not have to come back until time to depart -- moving back and forth between the boat and the rest of the island can take up a lot of time. The only restroom facility is on the ferry, so use the facility right before you leave the ferry so you don't have to come back mid-visit to the park.5) Arrive at the check in point early -- when you check in you are given a boarding pass, and you board by the number on your pass. You will want to have an early boarding position to be able to choose your seat. The bottom deck only has enclosed seating (although you can stand on the bow), and the top deck has outside seating and an enclosed seating area as well. You will likely be sharing a table/seating area with people outside your group as all seats are open for anyone to use. 6) You have to take everything off the boat with you during the day. There are no lockers, so you are carrying everything -- PACK LIGHT! 7) Everyone will be in different seats for the return trip home. If you care about getting a particular seat, you will need to get back to the ferry well before departure time -- but that eats into your time to tour the island, so you will have to make a choice. 8) If you ever get motion sickness, take dramamine -- you can buy it on the ferry if you forget it. 9) We went snorkeling very briefly -- we had never been before. The equipment isn't available until about 20 minutes after docking, but there is plenty for everyone, so don't feel like you have to rush to get that.The tour guides on the ferry are a wealth of information, and the information they provide will help you have a great visit. I felt that everyone working on the ferry really wanted the guests to have a great experience. I really loved this park, and we are considering going back to camp one night (and I DON'T camp) so we would have more time and be able to see the night sky from there!","May 14, 2018",Fantastic and Not to Be Missed,61,"Apex, NC",5

Snorkeling isn't really my thing, and the fish here weren't very colorful...doesn't compare to Caribbean or Hawaii, but others in my group enjoyed it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The park is a fort and water activities are typical for Florida. It is an amazing site for the civil war buff. On clear days the snorkeling would be amazing. The fort itself is in a ruinous state and you have the run of the place with limited oversight. Exceptionally unsafe areas are marked off, but there are none of the minimal guard railings to safety. Those would detract from the ruin and probably create a false impression of safety. It is a long ride to the park by concessionaire boat. The crew keeps you well fed and entertained on the way.

There are some old pilings from 2 long gone coal storage warehouses that have lots of coral, sponges and fish. If the wind is up they are a bit dangerous as there is a LOT of rusty metal beams and supports to watch out for. There are also some coral heads about 150 yds off the beach. My wife and I did three 1 hour excursions through the piers only. There are barracuda, sea fans, a nice variety of coral and plenty of fish. We saw two Barracuda at least 5 ft long and one 7ft nurse shark (common in the area). We had packed a picnic lunch we enjoyed and then we hiked around the fort for a bid.

The site could have used better markings where to go see tropical fish. The breakfast and lunch meals served were delicious, and the bartenders fixed up some fancy tasty frozen drinks. It was a special day this trip we got to see a whale shark, a rare siting. Don't forget to take some Dramamine with you for the way back. Sometimes the waves can be a little rough. If you don't have any, the crew will sell you some for a dollar a pill. Plan this event way in advance because it always sells out quickly. If you want to go camping at this site, call ahead.

The tour was a great experience with good breakfast and make sure you listen to Hollywood's 20 minutes presentation before walking the fort and enjoy the beach.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We've been trying to get to as many National Parks as possible and this one was on our list. We're history buffs so we like old forts, museums, places of scenic beauty and history. This trip to Fort Jefferson is a popular attraction and it takes a full day to take the ferry out, tour the fort, trying swimming or snorkeling and get back. Would be a hot trip in the summer so I'd advise going in fall or spring. We had a perfect balmy day.The cost for us was $155 per person (a $20 discount because we are National Park passport holders).Nice ride out on the Yankee Freedom with breakfast provided (bagels, granola, coffee, pastries, etc.) Lots of kids and teens on board. The Freedom crew kept the peanut butter and bagels around for most of the voyage. We bought some soft drinks along the way. Nice ride. Saw some loggerhead turtles in the water from the front deck and there were dolphins jumping, too.The Fort was build after the War of 1812 and was used to hold some some Confederate prisoners after the Civil War, including Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was convicted of conspiracy in the assassiantion of President Lincoln. His cell is on the tour. There is a guided tour but you can wander around on your own. There are interesting sections in the fort such as a building were they could heat cannon balls to make them more deadly. There are a lot of birds on the island and you can see a lot of fish while walking around the moat wall.The island was Discovered by Ponce de Leon in 1513, and named after the sea turtles (tortugas in Spanish) found there. It's ""Dry"" because there is no fresh water on the island.The 70 mile trip takes 2.5 hours and you have plenty of time to explore and swim. Masks and swim fins are provided. The changing room has no water but there are outside showers on the boat. You are free to snorkle without guidance so be careful.You can't take anything from the island. No shells, no rocks, nothing... There is a long lunch time set aside at mid-day for a help yourself sandwich buffet.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Had always wanted to visit this sourthen-most state park, and was not disappointed! Took the Yankee III ferry out from the ferry terminal, which to start with was a very organized affair. The fares are $175/person, but that includes breakfast, lunch, unlimited coffee & tea during the voyage. The food fare was fresh and fairly expansive for a ferry voyage - mixed cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, assorted breads, meats, cheeses, and spreads. Passengers were also welcome to go back as many times as they wanted. The 2.5 hr voyage passed by relatively quickly with additional tidbits about the surroundings from the tour guide throughout. Once arrived, disembarking was another organized affair, and we had about 20-30 minutes to search/explore on our own before some of the ‘organized’ offerings were available. Plenty of folks were going snorkeling, but there was also a couple of different guided tours offered by the tourguide - one about 20 minutes, and one approx. an hr/ hr & 15 minutes, depending on how much you wanted. There was also a set-guided tour available that was introduced and downloadable before we left the dock. We took the longer guided tour, which was very informative and definitely worth it. Our guide welcomed any and all questions and seemed very knowledgeable about the fort/park. After the tour, we had time to grab lunch - mixed selection of lunch items, fresh fruit, chips & pretzels, as well as plenty of water & soft drinks. We then had about an hour or two left to explore and relax around the fort before heading back to Key West. On the return trip, there was an open bar making drinks for folks, as well as a variety of snacks/food items offered for additional cost (not included in original fare). The tour guide also gave some additional commentary, but mostly, the trip home was an opportunity to enjoy the views, rest & relax - either inside one of the two levels that were enclosed and air conditioned, or outside in th breeze either fore or aft. Definitely worth the trip and worth spending a day this way. Would definitely recommend and do again.","April 26, 2018",Great day trip getaway from Key West,11,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The ferry really is nothing more than a mode of transportation to the Tortugas. There isn't much to see for the 2.5 hour trip from the dock to the island. One good thing is if you are prone to motion sickness, then this ferry should work for you. It's big enough to not really roll with low seas. Once you get to the island, you will have MORE than enough time to snorkel and visit the Fort. The snorkeling can be pretty cool, although when we were there, the water was a little murky (not the host's fault). The tour around the fort is nice, but doesn't take long. Food served was OK, nothing special, but filling. The interaction with the crew was limited, mostly with one crew member who seemed to act as the guide the whole time. If you are looking for an intimate trip (there were about 175 people on this) with full access to knowledgeable people then this might not be the trip for you. If you can afford it, I would recommend flying to the Park, you also might see more marine life in the water when you are in the air. Also flying takes a lot less time.","April 25, 2018","Boat Ride uneventful, snorkeling and fort very good",27,"Big Sky, Montana",3

The weather did not interfere with our walk around the fort. It was interesting to see the shear mass of this fort. I would have loved to have a tour by the rangers that live on the island but that was not available when we were out there. We snorkled a little. The water was clear but we did not go out far due to the wind causing choppy water. We have been to Key West several times and always wanted to take this trip so I am glad we did.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We got a partial refund as all National Parks were free on the day of our trip. The boat is pretty crowded so arrive early if you want your choice of seats--inside or outside. My wife and I chose outside to enjoy the scenery. Even though they don't sell all the seats, it was still pretty cramped. We had a beautiful day with no wind and the water was very calm. Smooth ride both there and back. We saw some dolphins along the way to Dry Tortugas. The sun was very bright and we definitely needed to use suntan lotion on the boat. Once getting to Dry Tortugas the time will go faster than you think. We opted not to do any tours but to explore on our own. It's a fascinating place with lots of great photo ops, and the water is just spectacularly beautiful. After exploring the fort and climbing around the top it was already after noon. Since you have to be back on the boat by 2:30 we had to rush to get lunch and do some snorkeling. Lunch was decent--sandwich meats, cheeses and snacks. That left us with about 90 minutes for snorkeling. There were plenty of fish by the sea wall. Sadly, there is a lot of dead coral about. We had time for a few more photos after snorkeling and were able to visit the book store to get our NPS stamp and some souvenirs. On the trip back you have the option of buying alcoholic drinks.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our group of 4 checked in at 7:15 am to the Yankee Freedom for our day long trip to the Tortugas. We were reimbursed $10 per person by presenting our National Parks membership card. One of our group has some mobility issues but he found he could easily maneuver getting on and off the ship. Seating was to capacity and tight. Probably about 175-200 passengers. Seating inside is mostly at tables and difficult to get in and out of easily. Take only the bare necessities in a back pack because there little room to store anything - I wore my swimsuit on trip out underneath my clothes, then brought a change for after swimming. Bring hat and sunscreen. There's very little shade at the fort! We had a generous and varied continental breakfast on the trip there. The waters were relatively calm the day we went with swells only 1-2 feet. We did purchase Dramamine which was sold for $1 per dosage. Our guide, Rob, was very affable and talked there and back about the history of the islands and about Fort Jefferson's own history. We arrived at the fort at @ 10:15 am, passengers had options to walk around the island, attend an informational tour, snorkel, swim, or stay on boat. Rob offered two opportunities for historical fort tour, an hour long walking tour and a shorter 20 minutes overview tour. Snorkeling gear was free for the use, with two areas designated for safe snorkeling. Changing facilities were available on the dock. Bathrooms were only available on the boat. Lunch was served on the boat from 11 - 1 allowing passengers to explore, snorkel, swim, and come and go for lunch at their leisure. My husband and I went to the shorter information session, then toured the fort at our own pace. This worked best for our companions who were not as mobile. While we swam and snorkeled, our companions had brought art supplies and camera to enjoy painting/photographing the interesting wildlife and architecture. The passengers had been asked to return to the boat no later than 2:30 pm. We arrived back at Key West at 5 pm. The trip out took about 2 1/4 hours and 2 1/2 on the way back. We all agreed that there were it was a fabulous trip!","April 16, 2018",Dry Tortugas on Yankee Freedom an interesting and fun trip!,13,"Winter Park, Florida",4

The 2.5 hr ride over can be bumpy depending upon the weather, ours ride was pretty good and comfortable. The food was pretty basic but def filled us up for our hours of walking thru the fort and snorkeling! Def bring sunscreen as your in the sun most of the time while at the fort and when on boat unless you sit inside. Try to get a table inside right away so it's comfortable for eating. You can always walk around to take pics. We brought our own snorkel gear however I would recommend using what they have so your not carrying everything around, although the ferry stays docked you cannot leave anything on the ferry. Be observant of the wind direction as this will determine which side is best for snorkeling. Def snorkel around the pilings you will see LOTS of different fish, beautiful! The fort is huge, so safe time to walk around. We did not do the tour as we wanted time to snorkel. You can download the self guided tour pdf on your cell but do this before you leave as you have no service once the ferry leaves. Bring water with you during the fort walkthrough as it gets hot.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Rented a car from FLL and drove to Key West the night before our ferry trip to Dry Tortugas. Used the parking garage across the street from the ferry terminal and checked in around 7:15am for our 8am departure. The Yankee Freedom was large and clean with 4 restrooms (heads) on the lower level. My daughter and I found a table downstairs in the air conditioning while my husband and son preferred to sit outside in the sun upstairs. Had a bowl of cereal, yogurt and orange juice from the cold breakfast buffet offerings that included cheese, ham, bagels, hard boiled eggs etc. The trip to Dry Tortugas lasted just over two hours and was very nice. We were able to walk around the boat and enjoy the views. Around 9am, they had a sign up for those that wanted to snorkel and use the equipment. We had to fill out a waiver and get a stamp on our hands. Around 9:45am, there was a sign up for the Fort Jefferson tours that either lasted 1 hour or a quick version of 20 minutes. Since my family was snorkeling, I signed us up for the 20 minute tour. Ferry docked around 10:15 am and we walked over to the beach and put our towels and bags down in a spot that had some shade. We headed over for our 11am tour where Ryzee was our guide and gave great information on the Fort. After our tour, we walked around the fort on our own, and went upstairs to the second level to view the island and take some pictures. After walking around a bit, we headed back to the ferry for a quick lunch. They offered make your own ham, turkey and tuna sandwiches, hummus, raw vegetables, potato salad, bags of chips or pretzels, fresh fruit, cookies and bottled water or canned soda. After lunch, we grabbed our snorkel gear and walked back to the beach area. The area along the moat and the back of the fort where our guides told us to snorkel was not very good. Visibility wasn't very clear and there weren't a lot of fish. The other snorkeling area with the pilings which is the suggested area on the free map of Fort Jefferson was MUCH BETTER! We saw large barracuda, colorful sea fans, many different tropical fish of all sizes swimming in schools or hanging around the coral beds. It was beautiful. After snorkeling, we hung out another 20 minutes on the beach, swimming in the water before heading back to the Yankee Freedom for the trip back to Key West. Everyone was to be aboard before 2:45pm. The trip back lasted 2 1/2 hours and they had a full cash bar which was great. Once back at the terminal around 5:30pm, we decided to walk over to Mallory Square to grab dinner and watch the sunset.

It is hard to do much with the time allowed. As far as the cruise out to the fort the crew is top notch and very helpful. We will probalbly not go out again but I can say we are glad we went out to the fort a second time. The issue is it takes about 2.5 hours to get to the fort and 2.5 hours back.

We had done a lengthy tour of the fort on a previous visit. It was good snorkeling. There is new growth coral on the wall of the fort. The March water temperature allowed for a leisurely snorkel. Later that day we met a couple who had flown out that afternoon. They arrived as our boat was leaving and they had the park to themselves. They described a flight where the pilot pointed out ship wreaks and dolphins. The mode of transportation is worth considering as well.

It really was a once in a lifetime experience. The national park was the entire Key and there was more than enough to do to fill the 4.5 hours you were actually on land. I was totally unaware of this national park and fort until this trip and its history was really interesting. We took the 45 minute tour included with the price of the boat ride and were happy that we did. The guide was very informative and shared lots of information that we would not have learned had we taken the self-guided tour of the fort. The tour covers all three levels of the fort and you do need to walk curving staircases between the levels. It is a lot of walking for those with mobility issues but we joined and left the tour at will and did not attempt the 3rd level steps. No big deal at all. There was also enough time to snorkel, had we chosen to do so or to walk around the grounds outside the fort, which had a moat. How cool was that!!

The boat was clean, the crew was helpful, super-friendly, and knowledgeable, and the food was great!Didn't take the tour of the fort - just wandered around on our own. Decided to snorkel the north wall of the fort after lunch. Visibility wasn't great because of the wind/waves, but still well-worth it. Snorkeling gear was okay, but bring your own if you have something decent. Seas were at a moderate chop going out and pretty severe for the first half coming back, but absolutely worth every bit of discomfort!

It was rough the day we went and a lot of people had to use the supplied ""little white bags"" both on the way over and the way back. Since the sea was rough, the snorkeling was not good that day. They serve both breakfast and lunch so your food is covered. The bar opens on the way back and has a nice variety.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It's a boat ride. It's a Fort. It's snorkeling, and it's all one day. I highly recommend this trip, if you get the chance -- it is well-worth it. It's 70 miles off the coast of Key West. I took the tour of the fort, and that was extremely interesting, to learn why the fort was built, and how it was key to the defense of the U.S. in the Mid-19th Century. The trip includes snorkeling, gratis, and that was interesting, although I didn't see much colored coral, but did see fish, and white coral, and it was fun. There are two spots to snorkel, so I don't now what is available on the other beach. There are no lifeguards, so you snorkel at your own peril, although there are no tough tides or waves. The boat ride was comfortable and fun. This was a great day. The ride is 2/1/2 hours each way. Like everyone says, you could use more time on the island.

We did the seaplane trip which was well done and a great experience. Much quicker than the ferry. Also, if you do the seaplane do the first morning trip or last afternoon trip - you will miss ALL the ferry traffic and have max people on the island of about 20 people for your whole visit. We did not snorkel since the water was pretty murkey on our trip but the flight, the history and exploring the fort and history was great. I, personally, wouldn't do one of the all day trips unless you want to just hang out on the beach all day, there are no activities on the island. DO bring some snacks - there are no services on the island. Another couple on our trip brought a small cooler of beer which was a great idea.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I took half day tour by sea plane, so it’s only 45 min one way ( including boarding, loading and unloading ). The flight is new experience to both of us, never fly so low before. The man made structure on the island is full of history and engineering values ( how crack in the structure compromises the island fresh water storage, and advancement in cannon make the fort obsolete).The reserved area is the nature part, you can see bird is having good time at that area ( despite activities by boat and sea plane nearby )Is the place perfect get away or must go ? I think NOT for the following reasons:1) it’s not really totally untouched, I see cigarette butt in sand on beach, the place is nice but not untouched like surface of moon. You won’t feel WOW when you arrive.2) the travel time ( especially by boat ), time is money, unless you haven’t experienced boat ride before, spending 6 hours to travel here doesn’t make sense especially if you are visiting Florida from somewhere far. I wouldn’t mind visiting here by plane again, but no way I will do it by boat.3) there’s nothing much to do on the island except sit back and relax. One advise for people who plans to do snorkeling here, check the water temperature before changing suits. My wife and I realized the water is too cool ( as we don’t have wet suit ) to our liking after we gear up. So a big embarrassment when other asked us whether we see any nice fish or coral...

Dry Tortugas National Park,"After a choppy 2.5 hour ride on the ferry, we arrived at the park. Fort Jefferson was interesting, and we were able to explore most sections. The beach area, however, was very small, with a large portion blocked from use. This was disappointing. We were led to believe there would be ample unspoiled beach to explore. This is definitely not the case. The park, at least the areas we were allowed to see is pretty small. 5 hours on a ferry wasn't really worth the 4 hours we spent at the park. Would we go again?

On the beach, you will find beautiful coral everywhere (don't take it!) and plenty of fish. We snorkeled near the walls of the fort for the best views of the underwater life. If you take the plane, you'll have the place to yourself for the most part after about 2/2:30, which is nice when you want to kick back and relax. We made the mistake of not thinking we needed to go for a day -- you absolutely should!

There is very little shaded area, so you might want to bring an umbrella, sunglasses and hat. You can snorkel and enjoy some of its reefs and underwater wrecks and/or at an additional cost stay to camp (must be planned ahead of time check out their website for more info). There is nothing else on the island not even a restaurant. You can tour the old Fort Jefferson which has the only restrooms on the island.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the half-day trip on the floatplane (Key West Seaplane Adventures)--worth the splurge! Instead of a 5-hour round trip on the ferry with dozens of others, we did the 8am flight that took less than 45 minutes, with 9 other people and had the island to ourselves almost the entire time. The downside: only 2.5 hours so not enough time to snorkel AND see the fort. I'm still not sure what everyone is raving about with the fort. It is neat looking, but I can't see spending hours walking around it--it's pretty barren. We wanted to snorkel. The water was fairly cold--you'll adjust, but it's kind of tough. We were thankful for our rashguard shirts that gave us a little extra warmth, but after an hour of snorkeling I had to get out. Snorkeling was awesome around the North Beach docks--beautiful variety of coral and colorful fish, including a barracuda! Also sea urchins. On the beach we found a conch with the critter still inside, and a few crabs. A full day might be too long unless you are a sunbather, reader, or you want to spend hours walking around the fort. It was HOT on the island and there's very little cover except the shade inside the fort. Lastly, don't worry if it's rainy in Key West on the day you are headed there. It was on our day and I almost canceled our trip. Very quickly it became dry and sunny as we headed out to Dry Tortugas, and the weather there was beautiful!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"A two and a half hour boat journey on a high speed catamaran takes you to Fort Jefferson. An island half-way to Cuba. This National Park is home to a colony of frigate birds (present in February anyway), which for a UK resident like myself is a sight worth seeing.. The fort is interesting in its history, which at times is quite moving, having been built,largely, by slave or prisoner labour. This should be a little paradise for snorkelers and birders, but be warned a little more information would be helpful to the visitor. We were advised by the guide to take a walk around the moat wall. This was enjoyable, especially spotting the fish and sea-life taking advantage of this protected salt-water channel. HOWEVER, half way around the moat the wall just disappears leaving an impassible section, requiring you to retrace your steps the way you came, you can't tell this until you have walked quite a way around the fort, which is quite large.Snorkeling is best at North Beach - go around to the supports for the old dock and swim through the old pier legs, there are living corals and quite a variety of fish.You should be aware that the fort gives the ONLY protection from the sun - so take LOTS of sun-screen with you and some SPF clothing. This should be little paradise for quiet contemplation but our visit was marred at North beach by the constant maneuvering of a 'shovel truck' moving rubble or similar. At the South beach the sounds of workers drilling was distracting. I would advise on checking what remedial work is being undertaken before travelling out there. We had bought this trip as a late Christmas present to each other, this noisy building work took the shine off ,an otherwise, splendid trip.

The views are breathtaking, especially from the walkway on top of the fort. Then we went to the beach for snorkeling. The trip back was fun, met 2 people who work for the park that were on the ferry, a marine biologist and a combat veteran turned park ranger.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Booked a week in advance after reading the great tripadvisor reviews. Didn’t disappoint. Visited with our 12yo boy, promising a fort and snorkeling adventure. Started at the port where we received a great intro from Rob, our tour guide, who continued to be engaging and entertaining for the day. Note that the only bathrooms were those on the boat (4 heads), none on the island, though there are changing rooms. Boat trip was long (2.5 hrs each way) but the crew was great, kept everyone busy with fun facts and videos. Our boat was full, so there were big lines for the meals - food was fine, with bagels, fruit, yogurt and cereal for breakfast and cold cuts and tuna salad for lunch. Fort was cool to explore, but hot on a sunny winter day. Snorkeling was better on the South Beach, but varies depending on weather. Maybe not as good as some other Caribbean islands for the density of fish. Wouldn’t choose fins - we tried but they just bogged us down. We were too timid to go to the coal pilings. Exhausted on the trip back. If you are addicted to your smartphone, download apps or bring other stuff to do ahead of time, since you’ll be off the grid. Lots of fun overall.

The catamaran ride is delightful, plenty of time to rest before the days adventures begin. The crew is helpful, friendly, and full of information. Once you get to Fort Jefferson you can do a guided tour, or walk around at your own pace, or you can just get write into the water! I highly recommend walking along the moat at least, it's not long or strenuous, but you will see the fort, and some fish/coral if you're not planning on snorkeling. The water is clear, and there's plenty to see.","February 12, 2018",Little Bit of Everything,11,"Laguna Niguel, California",5

The ferry ticket is a little steep but it’s cheaper than the seaplane option for sure! If you get seasick, take some Dramamine before you get to the ferry port since we hit some pretty rough waters on the way there. The included breakfast and lunch were okay and I don’t have any complaints about them. The park itself is amazing. It just pops up out of nowhere and it’s like a dream. The waters are so blue and Loggerhead light is beautiful in the distance. We split up and the fort has a very interesting history and some really good views!!

The crew was especially understanding and took really good care of those of us that ended up getting sick.They served breakfast and lunch included in the ticket and then snacks and alcohol for purchase at the end of the trip. I wasn’t brave enough to try snorkeling because it was quite a bit chilly and the water was very cloudy but the trip was still worth it.

It's an awesome boat ride out with a huge Breakfast Buffet and a guided tour passed islands used by sea turtles for nesting and lots of fun facts. The bartenders definitely know how to make a drink worthy of any Caribbean Island! The amount of time to explore the Park and do some snorkeling is perfect. We walked the whole structure, picked up debris (the hurricane had left some evidence) on our way to the permitting edge of Bird Island which is amazing too. The National Park Ranger inside was a hoot and full of awesome suggestions. We Snorkelled all over and the fish were not at all phased by our visit.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This place has been on my bucket list for years. It did not disappoint! We went there on a day trip. Now, I have something new on my bucket list. I want to come back and spend the night. We took the boat to get there (separate review). It really does not give you much time to explore the park. However, the plane ride was cost prohibitive for our family of three adults. When taking the boat, they offer a 20 minute or an hour and a half tour of the fort. We opted for the 20 minute tour. We just had time for a quick walk in the fort; then, the tour; a quick lunch; snorkeling by the fort walls and pier pilings; another quick look at the fort; a stop in the gift shop; back on the boat. It was like a whirlwind. Two of us did bring our own snorkel and masks. The other one used the boats equipment. Their supplies were nice. The beach is ground shells and very hard in the feet. The best snorkeling was by the old pier pilings. We saw lots of fish and coral. We would have loved to spend more time exploring the islands but just didn’t have time. My family was not familiar with the park at all. They truly enjoyed it. It was definitely one of our top things we have ever done. I will definitely be back.

Luckily we ran into a ranger from the park when we were out one night. She started telling us all about the Dry Tortugas National Park. She was so passionate about it and even offered to give us a personal tour if we came out. We decided later that we would try it and we are so glad we did. It was an amazing trip. The staff on the boat out were great and the park was so cool and such wonderful history. And as promised, Kelly Clark, the ranger we had met a couple of days before took time out of her day to give us a personal tour. She's a real asset to the park.

That way, you get to the park just as the daily boat trip is departing and you have the island to yourself and your 10 fellow passengers. The seaplane is a DeHaviland Otter--an Alaska bush pilot favorite. People who worry about ""small planes"" don't need to worry about the Otter. The Park Service provides fishing poles at the dock. Take your own bait for catch and release. Or just take a reel of line, some hooks and some bait. The fort is fascinating, and the park staff could not possibly be more gracious or accommodating--as long as you follow the rules. Your bring it in--you take it out. Take sunscreen, towels, water and any food you want. Take them at their word...once the ferry leaves the only facilities on the island for visitors are some outhouses.

Dry Tortugas National Park,I recommend taking the sea plane as it is an experience on its own. From the the plane you can spot marine life such as large sea turtles. You can also see sunken boats and ships on the bottom as the water is quite shallow and the plane flys at around 500’. If you time your plane departure properly you will miss the ferry crowds and have the island almost to yourself. Don’t expect someone to entertain you on the island as it is a national park and your experience is what you make of it. There is a tremendous amount of history here and a lot of hiking around and reading.The snorkeling is good around the fort. There are also tons of Hermit Crabs on the island.

I recommend taking the 8 am seaplane out of Keywest airport, you get there before the Yankee Freedom ferry arrives with hundreds of tourists. Other than handful of campers, only 20 people arrived by two seaplanes. The park takes about 40 mins, snorkel the rest of time and depart 11am, more than enough time to explore.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had a very good time on this trip. The staff is quite organized and very friendly, no delays on departure and return to Key West. You get plenty of time on the island itself and you chose if you want to do the tour inside or not. The only disappointment was the snorkeling. I assume it is because of the hurricane that there was pretty much no coral or fish to see and the water was not clear but that is beyond anyone's control. There is plenty of equipment provided for anyone who wants to try. With the tour you get breakfast and lunch and you can purchase drinks on the way back at very reasonable prices. The only people on the island will be those working on the fort itself, the people on the boat (staff and guests) and eventually a few people who come on a small plane so if you worry about having your bag on the beach or leave it on the boat, you will be just fine, everyone is there for a good time.","December 29, 2017",Great all day trip!,11,"Fairfax, Virginia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom ship to the Dry Tortugas. This was about a 2 hour trip and the ship and crew were great and helped make the trip go by quickly. Fort Jefferson itself was very interesting and the park rangers conducted some interesting tours. From the path along the wall, the views are magnificent. The water, the clarity and the colors are fantastic. We went snorkeling off the South Beach and didn't find too much to look at, perhaps because of the recent hurricane but some of the other folks who snorkeled off the North Beach seemed to have seen more fish and coral. Overall, this was an excellent trip and I would certainly recommend it as a unique and relaxing way to spend some time while in Key West.

The fort is full of colorful history (strongly recommend the guided tour offered by the Yankee freedom cruise). The park is largely under water. And it part of the third largest coral reef in the world. Take a walk around the fort or try snorkeling (we did both), and you'll see the amazing world happening in the water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"An amazing place. So often you hear so much about a place that you are a little let down when you finally get there, not the Dry Tortugas. Visitors are limited to those who arrived by boat or seaplane, so no crowds. Just you on a perfect beach, surrounded by azure water, in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. We took the Yankee Freedom there and the service is great, plus they provide everything for your visit. We toured the fort, snorkeled, lounged on the beach and enjoyed the provided picnic lunch. Special kudos for the hot shower before changing out of our swimsuits.","December 22, 2017",A bucket list must do,34,"Show Low, Arizona",5

This old brick fort, probably the last one built by the U.S. became obsolete as soon as it was finished. This key is not so big, The fort takes almost all of the land. You are visiting the fort, that is about it. If you are in to history... Abe Lincoln era, it's a great place. Interesting to visit but once you have seen it... you know it forever.","December 22, 2017","this is the end of the world, well almost.",6,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Perhaps the most amazing trip you can take is here to the Dry Tortugas. Camp if you can. and disregard the angry campers who really dont understand that the fort needs to be repaired after the hurricane damaged the walls. We had the unfortunate luck of camping next to some awful campers who did nothing but complain about the construction and actually camped outside of designated area and set up their tent in the closed off tree zone, also yelled at people who were walking through that area, which they shouldnt have set up tent there. People who cannot understand that the fort needs to be repair needs to reschedule their trip. If you plan to camp you have to book in advance, and if you did any research or watched the weather, you would have realized a hurricane did come through, so be mindful of that. the park gave you the chance to cancel post hurricane, but if you still come and complain then you're just an awful angry person. camping here was a lot of fun and if you bring enough drinks you wont be so grouchy.  If you're exploring the fort or walking on bush key or snokeling, you dont hear the construction sounds. Also if you're camping bring some earplugs it might make your stay a bit more pleasant. the workers do their best to start closer to 8 but if you're camping you should wake up for the most amazing sunrise anyhow and start your day. For the day trippers out there, this place is awesome. Went on the tour with Hollywood and he was amazing!, tons of history in the fort and around the wildlife is amazing. spent much of my lunch time watching all the hermit crabs just do their thing. Bush key is open during the dec time if you're headed there and you can see some of the most amazing birds just not too far flying overhead. Amazing birding for those who own binoculars. Snorkeling is awesome depending on the day you go, we didnt even have to go into the water to see two huge goliath groupers, they were at the dock. also spotted a sea turtle and sharks in the area so you can totally not get into the water and see some cool animals. overall a must visit.","December 17, 2017","Wow. also, come prepared for your adventure.",51,ispeakfoodtooblogger,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Amazing place, 5 stars for the park. But there is a massive construction project right next to the campground. Jack hammering and ban saws start at 7am and go until 5pm. It's camping in a construction zone--see photo for how close it is our tents. It's incredible to camp, I highly recommend it. Great stargazing, sunsets/sunrises and very few people after the boat leaves at 3. Bush key was open so we beach walked. However had this been a simple 4-6 hour drive away or had there been any other place to camp or a KOA or motel or hostel, no possible way would we have stayed camping there after the first day of 10 hours of jack hammering 25 feet from our tent. (Having flown to key west then spent $200 to ferry to an island 70 miles away, you make the best of it). Wait a few, 6 months until the construction moves to the other side of the fort. Then go and have an epic camping trip. ","December 14, 2017",Don't camp right now Dec 2017,10,,3

Dry Tortugas National Park,If you are collecting National Park rights or love old Forts this is a must see. Generally only 2 ways to get there. Boat or sea plane. I opted for the later as it was much smoother and faster. The fort it’s self is basically all there is. They do allow camping with preapproved reservations. You can stay up to 3 nights and you better love solitude or make fast friends with the few other lonely people on island. There is limited wildlife and snorkeling boring. Bring a big book. Only 2 rangers on the island today but can be more we are told. The ferry boat takes 2 hrs I was told from Key West and this is how campers bring their gear to island. Note there are no provisions including water so be good scouts. I was told by one camper that you cat take a cold shower from a hose on the ferry when it is docked. ,"November 24, 2017",Go but take a plane. ,23,"Colleyville, Texas",4

Gorgeous day and boat ride out to the park, and we got to spend several hours exploring the fort (takes about 45 minutes to an hour to walk all 3 levels) and snorkeling at two different beaches. Water was chilly at first, but we are from Florida and wimps. :) We explored the fort first, went back on the boat to eat lunch to have maximum time snorkeling and sunbathing. It was perfect! We brought our own snorkel gear, but they provide it for free if needed. The cruise back was even better with refreshing cold beer and pina coladas! Get the popcorn; you won’t regret it!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had been looking forward to this trip for months. The morning of the trip we were in line to check in and the tour guide made it very clear that it was rough seas with 4-6 foot waves. Being prone to motion sickness, I had already come prepared with Dramamine and patches. Needless to say, these did me no good as I spent about an hour and forty five minutes of the 2 1/2 hour ferry ride out getting sick into the vomit bags they hand out. Not a good time. However, the trip out was definitely worth it. The most beautiful water I have ever seen. The fort was so cool to explore. The fact that you could wander around and explore each floor of the fort, including the top, was awesome. It was also really cool to walk alone the top of the moat. Definitely recommend this trip, even if you are prone to motion sickness. ","November 20, 2017",Worth the trip,21,"Mantua, New Jersey",5

Plenty of seat, but we stood on the top back part of the boat so we could enjoy the scenery and beautiful weather. One the way out the crew checked on everyone, and one of them would tell us information as we went along. Once we arrived - we had the option to take a tour, swim, explore, or snorkel. Lunch was served for about 2 hours - we made our sandwiches and went to one of the many picnic tables to eat. The water was so beautiful, clear and many shades of blue. We found tons of shells, but could not take any. We saw a stingray and barracuda, plus lots of small tropical fish. It was an awesome adventure.

The staff on the ferry are exceptional and very efficient. The ferry carries 175 passengers. The seas were 4-6ft the day we went which made it a little bouncy. I would recommend motion sickness meds regardless of the weather or wind reports. Ft Jefferson is amazing and the tour by “Hollywood” from the ferry staff was very good and worth the time. It is difficult to imagine building this fort in the early 1800’s, 70 miles from the closest land and no fresh water on the island. We will definitely do this trip again.","November 16, 2017",Great experience,65,"Gallatin, Tennessee",5

And it's incredible. The turquoise shallow waters surrounding it makes this amazingly beautiful place seem to surreal & it's suddenly hard to imagine the stories that these walls hold. Now, you only have 4 hours there, so time is limited as there's lots to see and incredible snorkelling around the fort. There were two tours to choose from, one being 20 minutes and the other being 2 hours. And as much as I had wanted to pick the 2 hour talk, the time at this fort is very short, so we chose the 20 minute one given by the incredible Hollywood who was a vessel of information & we then looked around unguided. The views are breathtaking and the fort itself is captivating. Life there back in the day though must have been very hard and being a prisoner would've been near on barbaric. But as it stands today, it's incredible & the snorkelling is stunning. A word of warning, there is no water at the fort, so bring your own refreshments and the only toilets available are on the Yankee Freedom boat - luckily both refreshments and clean toilets are plentiful on the boat. They also provide snorkelling equipment as part of the days package.

Breakfast and lunch was what we expected and enjoyed. The history of the island was interesting and the beaches were small but so us the island. We really enjoyed our time at the beach.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Make sure to save a day for this trip if you are visiting key west. What an amazing experience it was. It's located 70 miles from key west. A spectacular island with a fort in the middle of nowhere! Turquoise water and abundant sea life. Best place for snorkeling or a walk on the beach. We found lots of shells, washed up corals and jellyfish on the beach. The fort is also pretty nice. Climb up the fort and there you have an amazing view!","November 1, 2017",Amazing!,7,"San Diego, California",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was so blown away by this experience. I had never been on a seaplane and was a little nervous; it was a blast. The pilot was very professional and friendly, and gave us a tour as we flew over spectacular vistas, telling us history and information about the islands and the sea as we flew over them. And the fort and surrounding waters were a sight to behold. The seaplane is definitely worth it, for the excitement and maximizing time you have on the island, where we walked through and atop the fort, snorkeled and swam in the warm sea waters. It was paradise. Don't miss it, totally worth every penny! A highlight of my trip, for sure.","October 31, 2017",Unbelievable experience!,0,"Chicago, IL",5

They were accommodating in every way that they could be. My son and I camped for 2 nights at the Fort. Wonderful experience. We met some new people and made some hopefully lifelong friends. The camping is not for everyone. It is very primitive camping. You must bring in all needs including water. That being said, I can't wait to go back! If you're not into camping the day trip would be well worth the time. Breakfast and lunch on the ferry included. Again, can not say enough about exploring the Fort and the staff.

Dry Tortugas National Park,We took the 8 a.m. seaplane to Dry Tortugas which everyone told us was the only way to go and we agree. The seaplane takes a half hour and the boat ride is 3 hours long. An added bonus to the 8 a.m. seaplane is you have the entire island to yourself for two hours before the boat arrives. By that time you’re getting back on the plane and heading home. The fort is amazing and if you’re lucky you’ll run into an employee who can answer questions and tell you more of the history. Unfortunately the day we were there the water was cloudy so snorkeling wasn’t very good but the water was warm so it wasn’t a total waste. I’d recommend this trip to everyone and definitely take the seaplane.,"October 29, 2017",A Must See,59,"Council Bluffs, Iowa",5

Wildlife is amazing: goliath grouper, mangrove snapper, Pompano, tarpin, sea turtles, nurse sharks (right up in the surf), and about a million curious hermit crabs! Irma may also have blown mosquitoes into town, so DO BRING BUG SPRAY (for the sand flies too). Even the rough seas provided adventure as we kayaked to submerged Bird Key, crossing the 90-foot-deep ship channel in 3-5 foot swells.

The ride was beautiful although some passengers had some sea sickness on the way back. The island and fort had very little damage from Irma but the snorkeling was not as good because of the cloudy water conditions. This includes breakfast and lunch. Breakfast was pretty poor they ran out of bagels in about 10 minutes and had no other bread option. I has a couple mini sized yogurts. The fruit was from a jar and very bitter. Lunch was much better with several different choices to make your own sandwiches and chips along with watermelon and strawberries which were fresh. Snorkeling equipment was included.

You know going to the island what you will see , hear the explanation why the fort was built, the usual info you need to explore the fort, However if you are not a person who snorkels, mmmmm what to do while everyone else in your party is going snorkeling? So put on your bathing suit and get yourself down to the beach and go in the water and sit, and just relax!! you don't have to go in far, just enough to cover you when you sit down. The water is warm and inviting and magical (okay I know it sounds corny but it was).

Only way to get to Ft Jefferson on one of the Dry Tortuga's is by boat or seaplane...pick your choice. Plane is faster and costs more (and you arrive before all the ferry passengers if you take the morning flight), and ferry is less expensive but costs considerably less. You make the call.You can picnic, camp, snorkel and visit Ft Jefferson on the island, but no food or drink is sold on the island, so you have to bring it with you. There is a small gift shop, but no food or drink is sold on the island which is a National Park, so a national park fee is required...about $10 a person to visit.I gave it five stars just because it is so unique and has a very interesting history.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"An idyllic location 68 miles west of Key West. I hesitated to book this trip as it was a full day of vacation and expensive , but it was well worth it. I went with Yankee Freedom 111 ferry ,booking online in advance; please see my separate review. There are no amenities on the Key, not even toilets - everyone uses the facilities on the ferry. Fort Jefferson was very impressive, an amazing construction feat , bearing in mind that when it was built the Keys were not connected by 42 bridges and all the materials came down by boat from the North East U.S.I attended a lively and passionate talk by Hollywood full of information about the strategic and geographic importance of the Tortugas. A longer talk was available but time was preciously short and my main reason for visiting the Tortugas was to snorkel. The water was warm and calm with good visibility. The best snorkelling was around the old coaling dock ruins. There were excellent soft corals growing amongst the ruins which were really fun to swim between. I was quite disappointed by the sparsity of fish in comparison with other areas I have snorkelled world wide, including Sombrero reef at Marathon, which had poorer coral and visibility but a higher density of reef fish. I saw no larger marine life but lots of seabirds. There were excellent vistas from the top of Fort Jefferson. Ideally more time on the Key and travelling time would have been better but I just couldn't justify the additional cost of a seaplane and the boat ride was relaxing, calm and fun.","September 24, 2017",An Excellent Day out from Key West,151,"Cockermouth, United Kingdom",5

Turtles, sharks, ship wrecks, and gorgeous water all the way from Key West to the Dry Tortugas. Once we arrived we spent about an hour exploring the Site. There are ranger led tours available and a small gift shop. We packed a lunch and enjoyed a picnic on the beach. The snorkeling is great and a must if you enjoy snorkeling. I would definitely recommend seeing the Dry Tortugas and learning about the history of the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas NP one of the most remote national parks. Quite literally. It is 70 miles west of Key West and mostly only accessible by boat. It consists of a unfinished fort on a tiny key, a few surrounding tinier keys and a whole bunch of pristine diving waters. You can camp, but there are only a few spots and virtually no facilities.You can enter on your private boat, or you'll have to sign up with a commercial partner to get there. Due to the convoluted rules the NPS puts on commercial partners (google it), there are not that many. Dive operations are all liveaboards, as single-day trips are simply not profitable. You can also fly in. For regular folks, the 'ferry' ""Yankee Freedom"" that goes from Key West is your only option. They're a separate review, but you should realize that they are a few frills bus boating you back and forth. Reservations are non-refundable, and they go unless the weather is really, really bad. They are happy to hand out puke-bags and clean up after you. Please note, they leave on time and don't wait for you. The trip takes 3-4h depending on weather. Ft Jefferson is an unfinished fort built to control the local waters. The purpose of the fort was overtaken by history and it was never finished. Nevertheless it's an amazing structure and certainly unique. There is a wall surrounding yourself the whole fort that you can walk on. It's kinda near because you're kinda walking on water. You can also snorkel around the fort. Visibility depends very much on the weather and the weather of the few previous days. If it's been nice, you will have fantastic snorkeling. If it's been windy, the waters may be murky. You will have to swim out a bit to see coral. Be careful with the currents. Also, there is a crocodile that hangs around north beach. Note there are no life-guards. We saw a turtle nest on the beach.All in all, Dry Tortugas park is a unique experience that is totally worth it, but you need to know what you're getting yourself into. This is a sparse park. No toilets. No vending of food or drink. No store. Prepare for intense Florida sun, bring sunscreen, and prepare to snorkel in the open sea. Also, know that Park Rangers fight to be stationed here.","September 18, 2017",Fantastic Park - Very dependent on weather,164,"Arlington, Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom out to the Tortugas for a day of snorkeling as part of our family vacation to Key West, and I have to say it was my favorite part by far. The crystal clear waters are unparalleled and the coral and manmade formations are truly interesting. Not to mention the wildlife- we saw barracudas, giant groupers, tarpon, and a myriad of smaller colorful fish that I couldn't name if I tried. On top of the snorkeling and diving, the fort is an amazing site and the history is quite interesting if that's your type of thing. The boat ride out was calm as could be and standing on the bow I got the opportunity to see quite a bit of wildlife- dolphins, flying fish, even a sea turtle. Our boat even got buzzed by a fighter jet on drill from the nearby Key West Naval Station! The food wasn't bad on the boat and facilities were great. Overall, definitely a must see- I really can't say enough about this place! The only thing that may be problematic is the price- definitely on the pricey side, but if you can swing it, you won't regret it!","September 12, 2017",Must-see!!,1,,5

I agree with other reviews that advised bringing dramamine if you are prone to sea-sickness, and thought the price is a little steep.

The last week in April, 2017, and the last day of our stay in Key West, we were able to get a reservation on the Yankee Freedom boat ride. This was the centerpiece of our 2 week dream vacation in the Keys. We got a senior discount, and no National Park entrance fees for us because I already have a Lifetime Senior pass for all national parks. That was another 20 bucks off. The main idea here is BOOK WELL IN ADVANCE. For us the weather was almost perfect. Quite hot. The only shade is inside the fort, or on the boat. I went inside the fort and climbed around, while my wife stayed out in the sun. The fact that Dr. Mudd, who was in cahoots in the assassination of President Lincoln, ended up here at Fort Jefferson, was imprisoned until his death. Being a history nerd, this stuff excites me.

The snorkeling is only average here so I wouldn't go for the snorkeling. Because of the distance and time required to get here it is an expensive trip.

My wife didn't snorkel but walked around the fort about 5 feet away from me as I did. It was about 10 feet of water near the wall. Do not bother snorkeling where the grass is. There is a lot of things to see near the wall. There is not a lot of shade near the beach. Walk the fort before you pick up your snorkel gear.

Stingrays, barracuda, large jelly fish and other schools of fish have been seen. However, it is not like snorkeling in the Caribbean (at least near to shore it is not). There are also picnic areas and you can also camp there for $15 per night. It is a primitive camping area so come prepared. No restaurants, toilets are only open at certain times.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you want to take a tour to Dry Tortugas make plans in advance! The first time we stayed in Key West we couldn't get tickets! The ferry is sold out 2-3 month in advance. This time I made online reservations 8 weeks prior to our trip. If you want to be one of the first persons on board get there early. We arrived at the pier at 7:30 and were No.125. They board by numbers. Who comes first will have access first.The Ferry ride with the Yankee Freedom is very enjoyable. The crew is very nice and friendly. Between 8 and 11:00 they serve breakfast (breakfast and lunch are included in the fare). You can buy snacks and sodas too. Have in mind that the Yankee Freedom is sold out! Every place is taken! It can get crowded. After leaving Key West and a couple of smaller islands you will see just open water.When you arrive at Dry Tortugas take a turn to the left side of the fort (follow the walk way to the beach). Try to find a place at the beach in the shade (under the trees and bushes) before you explore the fort! Shady places are very rare on this island (unless you bring a sun umbrella) and fill up quickly. Then visit the fort or take a guided tour. After that it's probably a good time to get your snorkel equipment from the crew (unless you brought your own). Have in mind that Dry Tortugas doesn't provide anything (no food, no umbrellas or sun beds). You will always have to get back to the ferry for things like food, restrooms etc.The best snorkeling is behind the fort. We saw barracudas, tarpons, small aquarium fish, a sea turtle etc. The water is crystal clear! It was enjoyable. Between 11:00 and 2:00 lunch will be served on board. Use the opportunity to cool off!By 2:45 you are expected back on board. The ship leaves at 3:00 and will be back in Key West by 5:00-5:15ish (weather depending). On the way back they have a cash bar.We have been to better snorkel places in the Caribbean and the beach isn't that great either (the sand is very coarse, lots of corals and shells). Might be a good idea to bring water shoes. On the island there is no cell reception! If you are on a budget I would think twice before going... My family and I thought it was a nice trip, yes, but it wasn't something that was ""outstanding"" or something like ""once in a lifetime"". If you want good snorkeling in Key West try Fort Zachery State Park and safe yourself a lot of money.Nevertheless we enjoyed this trip very much.","August 27, 2017",Pleasant Day Trip,23,Maryland,4

The boat ride out was relaxing, the tour of the fort our guide, Hollywood, gave was so informative and interesting (you must at least do the condensed 20 minute tour- the history is amazing). The water is more beautiful in person than in pictures if that's possible. Snorkeled around the old coal pilings- lots of fish and beautiful coral reef.

There's a cash bar on the way back to Key West. The snorkeling was amazing! You may have to swim out a bit from the fort, but if you choose not to, the coral and fish along the fort base are diverse and active! Tips: definitely bring sunscreen, sports drink and a hat!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a day trip to Fort Jefferson, principally to snorkel. The trip was good, the crew excellent, the food they served good as well. It's just that a day is too little time. We spent our day snorkeling around the outside of the fort, and didn't really have time to tour. The snorkeling was interesting, in that the outside of the fort is essentially an ""artificial reef"". Sadly, the day was quite windy, so the water was stirred up, and visibility wasn't as good as it might have been. I hope to return one day, and camp, so I can do the place justice.","August 22, 2017","Good day trip, but a day trip is too short.",5,"Colchester, Vermont",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The fort is an amazing piece of history and worth going to see on its own. But in addition, the snorkeling is fantastic, and we saw lobster, rays and barracuda in addition to a few thousand smaller fish. Finally, the views from the plane showed scenery that was mind-bending, like sand patterns beneath the shallow water that looked like the Sahara underwater! I wouldn't say it's an easy trip, especially in the hot summer as there is not much shade anywhere at the fort, but it's a very worthwhile trip.","August 22, 2017",Seaplane trip makes for an astounding day,186,"Durham, North Carolina",5

It's well worth the cost and once there you will experience some of the finest snorkeling available in the keys. Both the north and south piers have an abundance of several types of coral and are home to more variety of tropical fish then you could shake a stick at. Plus this is real American history that few get to see. Even the teenagers that were in our group were amazed by what the saw and heard from the helpful park rangers. Great time and worth the price.

Treat yourself to gorgeous scenic views along the way, it's all part of the experience! We did the 8am departure, which I would recommend, because later on you are dealing with hundreds more people from the ferry service, not to mention the afternoon heat! We opted for the 1/2 day due to cost, but I wish we had another hour or so, because I think a full day would've been too long. We spent about an hour checking out the fort, and then another hour or so snorkeling. Stay along the wall, and you will see great fish- I spotted a large ray and my husband spotted a barracuda!! Fun, memorable day! John the pilot was great in pointing out landmarks along the way, including shipwrecks and sea life. Be sure to tip him, some people did, some didn't. We gave him $20 and he seemed happy with that. ","August 17, 2017",WOW!!,2,,5

For most fun, grab your bathing suit and some friends and make it a full day of sailing to and touring this Civil War Fort...Fort Jefferson. The boat trip, on the Yankee Freedom, to and from takes several hours, but worth every moment as you tour the fort and/or snorkel around the fort. Be sure to snorkel the old Civil War docks...filled with beautiful fish, including huge Tarpon. Care to just relax? There are numerous beach areas.

The boat ride goes fast if you bring something to do, but you will have to stick to old fashioned entertainment as there is no wi-fi for obvious reasons......you are off the grid people.This trip is remote and it is worth it. The waters surrounding Ft. Jefferson are incredible. There is so much history here. I only wish we could have stayed longer. The crew on the Yankee Freedom is great...special shout out to Hollywood.

We walked around the mote and saw our typical keys fish ( parrot fish, blue angel fish, grouper, and zebra fish). The main snorkeling is around the mote walls and a broken bridge area. The fort has various areas that are closed off and just a few signs describing the fort itself. Our family had more fun at Fort Zachary Taylor and we saw more species in the waters there than at the Dry Tortugas. This is a great destination if visiting the keys and not familiar with our waters.","August 11, 2017",Not a place for locals,2,"Ramrod Key, Florida",3

A few thoughts on the ferry-Need gluten free options Drink mixes were low quality and not very goodI was totally turned off the the ""raffle"" ticket sales towards the end of the ride back. It seemed like a complete side hustle on the part of the crew. Buy tickets to win a piece of merchandise from the store-really? Seemed like some kind of carnival show act.

Once our pilot arrived, the ferry was actually starting to dock and we were so glad to avoid the crowd. Be careful of the fort bc their are no safety precautions like handle bars on the edges and flooring is uneven, especially on the top level. ","August 9, 2017",Awesome,2,,4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Certainly, there are better beaches and better coral for snorkeling in the world; however, I can tell you there is no experience so singular as enjoying the beaches and snorkeling in Dry Trotugas in the shadow of Fort Jefferson. And unfortunately, there's not really anything I can say that does justice to the experience of standing on top of a fort staring out into the many hued ocean waters. If you're in Key West, you just have to go and see it for yourself. It was the single-most memorable vacation experience I've had the pleasure to enjoy, and I really can't recommend it highly enough.Now on to the practicalities. We took the sea plane route and were glad we did, as we practically had the entire place to ourselves. There is very litle shade outside the fort itself, so plan the length of your stay accordingly. The Jefferson can be enjoyed in about 45 minutes of a self-guided tour (there are no walking tours anymore according to the rangers). Once you've seen the fort, there's beaches and coral to enjoy at your leisure. Remember that there is no food or beverages for purchase on the island, so take provisions with you. Take a camera too.","August 8, 2017","It's expensive, it's inconvenient, it's time consuming, and it's absolutely 100% worth it.",2,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,This is my fifth trip out to the fort. It's a full day excursion and we never have to worry about food or gear. The ferry takes us out and we keep our eyes peeled for all the sea turtles we pass. We breakfast and the ride is smooth. Once at the four would like to walk the rim on the upper layer to take pictures and to scout where the Coral is. We discovered it's just off around the corner of the fort from the beach but it helps to show our friends or kids to give them perspective. After taking photos we get our gear from the ferry and swim out to the coral from the beach. It is right at the surface and no waves or currents so even the youngest/oldest of us can see the pristine coral heads. Lovely trip!,"August 8, 2017",Bliss in the middle of the gulf!,4,,5

A lot of logistics and planning go into hauling 2 nights camping gear from Dallas to Key West -but we made it happenDeep history at the fort, beautifully clear waters surrounding it and an incredible experience to be one of just a dozen or so people on the island after the boats and planes have left.At night - Bright milky-way and amazing shooting-stars complete with trails and tracking blinking satellites across the heavens.In the early AM - Beautiful colors for sunrise and incredible sounds of the island birds beginning the day.200 pound grouper caught and released around the dock pilings, huge tarpon and amazing fish varieties all around the barrier walls of the fort.Finally - we kayaked to Loggerhead Key and didn't see another soul the entire morning while snorkeling in pristine waters full of live conch shells, starfish and sea-life around the old docks and abandoned structures of the island.Not everything is fantastic though in July heat and sweltering humidity - imagine trying to tent sleep in these conditions. A bit of breeze helps - but 100s of moving hermit-crabs keep you from just crashing on the open beach.Park Rangers are laid-back and helpful and the small NP visitors-office on the island is well-done.Start your DTNP planning now - it truly is an amazing place!","August 5, 2017",National Park & National Treasure!,74,"Mansfield, Texas",5

The snorkeling is okay, I've snorkeled better reefs though (for instance Grecian Reef at the John Pennekamp SP). Maybe I didn't go our far enough. The two small beaches are nice. Most people go out on the ferry. BOOK THAT AHEAD. It was filled up when I tried, I was lucky to get a seat on the Seaplane, which cost 3x as much (but was kind of a cool adventure on it's own though, and a lot faster).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Yes it is a long trip to get out there. We took our own boat out there, and it takes hours to get there and back, but it's totally worth it. It's hot, and very secluded, so make sure you're hydrated, and bring extra food for everyone. Snorkeling the island is incredible, and there is a ton of sea life to see. Some days, after a storm, the water may be murky and oh may not see turtles or fish. Make sure to book your trip, or take your own boat during great conditions. The weather should be clear and sunny for days prior to going out, clear and sunny the day you go, and stay hydrated ! There really isn't much ""to see"" on the fort, but there is so much history involved in this trip, it's incredible to see it for yourself ! The old canons are amazing, and the fort itself is really something to see ! People who have said it was ""boring and hot"" or they ""hated the charter"" that took them out, or ""it takes forever to get there"" must have not done their research before going out. There is a lot of planning involved in getting there, and being safe. You're far from help and far from the mainland. If you're going to go, plan plan plan and enjoy this piece of history.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Took the Seaplane over for a half day trip. 40 min. in the air versus an almost 2 hour boat ride! Well worth the extra cost and you're not there the whole day. Toured the fort first then snorkeled for the first time. I would recommend snorkeling near the pylons to see the best varieties of fish and corals.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This amazing national park located 70 miles out into the Gulf of Mexico if a definite must visit. This review is based on the park itself, not the transport out there. We used the Yankee Freedom III, which I do not recommend and reviewed separately. It is hard to completely cover this island in a day. By the time you travel out there, you only have 3-4 hours to do all you want to do. The snorkeling was excellent. We swam about 80 yards off shore to the coral heads marked on the map. Their location is not marked in the water, so you are swimming out pretty far through sea grass hoping to come upon them. I would encourage you to read some snorkel blogs that will tell you how to find the coral heads once you get in the water. If you are adventurous, it is definitely worth the effort. We saw more fish there than anywhere else we snorkeled. It is not very deep once you get out there. Maybe 6-8 feet. We spent most of our time in the water and did not have time left to tour the rest of the island or the fort. I would recommend finding a boat that gives you the maximum amount of time available. There is camping available on the island. You have to pack in and out everything you need. This option would give you ample time to explore, but presents its own challenges. Sea planes are also available to transport you out there and would provide you more time, but they are the most costly option.","July 25, 2017","Amazing National Park, Great Snorkeling",8,"Little Rock, Arkansas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Living in Florida, I try and avoid the crowds. I get in my jeep and look for the beaches and areas that are secluded or at least not crowded i.e. Cocoa Beach pier as I don't like being in the water around fisherman casting lines or chumming for obvious reasons. Well, the dry Tortugas are only accessible by boat or plane. The boat ride is a blast, the plane ride is amazing. Once you get to Ft. Jefferson, which itself is rich with history. Who builds a military fortress in the middle of nowhere? Where there really that many pirates? :) I recommend your bring your own snorkel gear, lots of bottled water and a good lunch and snacks. We snorkeled the entire island with the exception of off-limit area where boats and planes dock. The reef and animal life are abundant and beautiful. We even saw a large lionfish and let the park rangers know (dinner!) as it is an invasive species to our waters. The clarity of the waters is amazing as are the beaches. You can camp on the island with a permit as it is national park land. It is a great day trip without crowds! I am sad that they removed Cleatius - a local American Saltwater Croc who frequents the moat at Ft.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Family of 4 - 2 boys 12 and 9 - We took the seaplane over for 1/2 day - we explored the fort and the boys couldn't have had more fun climbing around the cannons and walls. The views from the top are fantastic! Snorkeled some - perfect for the boys, protected water and stuff to see (fish, some coral, the fort's seawall) - but if you are a seasoned snorkeler, you'll probably be a bit bored close in (have never snorkeled out in the deeper reef, but heard it is very good). Wildlife is hit or miss - we were lucky on out flight and saw sharks and dozens of turtles from the air (didn't see any at the fort, but again we were close in and shallow water). The thing about Jefferson is the remoteness, the history of the fort, the ""what and why did they do this?"" Love being out there in the literal middle of the ocean and soaking in the silence, views, breeze and smells. If you want lights and action, this is not for you - it is however a truly unique experience and l recommend it highly.","July 24, 2017",Brilliant Keys/National Park experience,77,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

The Truman museum is a couple of small rooms and not much else. Fort Taylor beach is worth the visit and you can easily spend a day there. The Key West Eco-Center is also located on the Truman compound as is a decommissioned coast guard ship. For younger kids, it is a good visit and can be use for a day of biking and beach time.

Just being out on the ocean is magnificent & the you reach the islands. The waters are crystal clear making this the best place to snorkel in all of the keys.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is an expensive outing but worth every penny. It begins with a two-hour ferry ride. The crew is amazing - helpful, friendly and very attentive. They walked around to check on everyone when we got underway to make sure no one was seasick or anxious. They served us breakfast (bagels, cereal, fruit, etc.). There were several times when one of the crew explained over the PA system what we were seeing as we passed several keys and what to expect upon arrival to our destination. The fort and beaches were fun. I spent most of the time there snorkeling. A barracuda swam around us for much of the time - curious but docile. There were a variety of fish to see and my friend also saw a giant conch. Lunch was served on the air conditioned ferry for a 2-hour period while we were there. Food was plentiful and tasty. Lots of beverages were also offered due to the heat. The day went by quickly and was so much fun!

There was a no frills breakfast and a few more options for lunch. The crew was very knowledgeable and helpful with all questions. We did not join the guided tour of the fort to try to maximize our four hours at the park. It was my first time snorkeling and I was a little disappointed. Thankfully one beach was much clearer than the other, so I definitely recommend checking out both sides. The scenery was very beautiful, but it was very, very hot! (Granted we did book this trip in July, so it was expected.) Take a few minutes and also walk around the moat, its very picturesque. All and all, it was a great day but pricey day.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is an expensive excursion, but it was money well spent. We took the Yankee Feedom ferry out. The fort is well maintained, but they do try to keep it as authentic as possible. There are no guardrails on the top story. The views are extravagant. The water is so blue and clear. When you visit, I suggest exploring the fort first, then spend the rest of your time in the water. If you visit the chapel portion, go all the way to the back of it and look straight up. There is a brick in the roof that is signed. It is the only signed brick in the whole structure. The attendant in the store was super friendly and knowledgeable. If you snorkel, go to the coal pilings and against the mote wall, that's where all the action is, and it's like swimming in an aquarium. There are a lot of barracuda, but they don't bother you. The beach is finely ground shells, I walked barefoot comfortably. If you have very sensitive feet, bring water shoes. There is no fresh water or bathrooms on the island, so plan accordingly.

We were able to walk on top of it too. There is a moat around it-no swimming in it though. The snorkeling was a little rough in the waves as we were there on a windy day, but if you stay along the moat wall it is great. There is a small beach area and you can camp on the island too but need reservations in advance. There is a gift shop there, too.

You get breakfast and lunch on the boat, so no need to bring food. The Park itself is very interesting. We had the option of taking a 1 hour tour. It was worth it.

After checking in, a ship staff member briefs you about the ship/Dry Tortugas, you then board at 7:30 and leave at 8. They serve a no frills breakfast that gets the job done. The boat ride takes about 2 1/2 hours and is very enjoyable.Once on Dry Tortugas, we attended a lecture by ""Hollywood"" who was extremely knowledgeable and courteous. I loved his passion for history and the island. He was also more than happy to answer any additional questions we had. We then snorkeled around the fort and saw beautiful fish/ruins from the fort.

The water is so beautifully crystal clear with varying shades of blue, that it is hard to describe the breathtaking beauty.

The settings were magnificent for at historic walk around the island and in, around and on top of Fort Jefferson. The surroundings were kind of out of this world-beautiful, just magical, and we went snorkling and swimming around the fort spotting e.g. barracudas and lots of colorful fish. This trip was by far the best experience I had spending two weeks in Florida, including Miami, Orlando, Fort Myers, Key West and Key Largo. Kind of unspoiled, a limited number of tourists getting access to this beautiful gem a couple of hours by ferry from Key West. Something that I will definitely remember. Not even a couple of showers and an hour of thunder made a difference. The trip was well organized as well - being served both breakfast and lunch, water and softdrinks. There were seatings for all passengers. Only criticism is the tour guide who seemed to make never-ending speeches.A very nice break from the tourism madness in The Keys - a lovely, lovely day and highly recommended for everyone.","July 10, 2017",Best experience of my Florida round trip,3,"Egaa, Denmark",5

The boat ride takes some time; however, the benches were comfortable - and if you sit on the forward outside deck - the wind is cooling and the view is amazing.After arrival at Ft Jefferson, we went on a 20 minute tour with Hollywood, and he told us the history of WHY there was a fort. It is obvious he loves his job, the Fort and the Dry Tortugas - and it made it more interesting for everyone. After the tour - we had lunch on the boat - sandwiches, chips, potato salad - and then we went snorkeling. The snorkeling is fun - beginners can hang around the beach and people more comfortable with swimming in a current can swim in the pilings or around the fort. After snorkeling, we boarded the Yankee Freedom for return - thankful that the boat was air-conditioned inside. Great trip!","July 1, 2017",Day at Fort Jefferson,2,,5

Although the boat ride is long the boat is large and has options of inside (AC) or outside seating.

Neat stuff.As a 12 year old, I would have loved the fort. As a 40-something year old, It's not that exciting unless you like steamy army buildings.Point blank: the ride out there stinks. You'll be on the water for 4 hours(2 there, 2 back). On the way back, it felt like we were literally hopping waves. Inside the cabin, you could hang meat and outside it was a sweaty 'good' time. :/Still despite the trip, this is a really cool place and is an aquatic wonderland. I imagine camping there is probably pretty cool, too.","June 30, 2017",Excellent....for snorkeling!,1,"Lakeland, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,I've been wanting to visit The Dry Tortugas for a few years now and finally had the opportunity during a little Stay-cation to the Keys. I wasn't disappointed. I went through the Yankee Freedom III Dry Tortugas Tours and it is a day long trip. It's about a two our boat ride each way and you get to spend about four hours on the island. Fort Jefferson is amazing. If you choose to do the 1 hour tour you'll learn some of the fascinating history behind it. For a place literally out in the middle of nowhere it actually did serve a very important purpose in American history. Once you've done touring the Fort you can cool off in the crystal clear waters of the Gulf and do some snorkeling while you're out there. This is a really great and different way to spend a day in the Keys and would recommend it to anyone especially history buffs. ,"June 29, 2017",Fantastic Day Trip ,48,"Naples, Florida",5

The views all around are fantastic and there is a ton of fish and other wildlife around. Do not miss the chance to see this park. It's faster to get here via seaplane from KW also but much more expensive than the boat. Best way to visit would be in your own boat or to camp on Garden Key next to the fort for a few days.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were amazed by the photos of Dry Tortugas. It is an interesting place. We were most interested in the snorkeling. BUT there was a storm in the gulf and the wind was blowing. The water was choppy and the sky was gray. Since this has to be booked weeks in advance and since our vacation was planned around this, we had to go. The tour of the fort was interesting. The location was beautiful. But the snorkeling was disappointing. The boat trip out and back is over 2 hours. The boat crew was great. Breakfast is served soon after boarding the boat. Lunch is available for a couple of hours after arrival. Drinks and snacks are for sale after lunch. The boat has fresh water showers for you to rinse off the salt water before the trip back. They do supply snorkel equipment including snorkel life vests for flotation. I had emailed to ask if they provide any type of flotation and was told to bring my own. After purchasing a vest for one member of my party, I saw they do provide them. The food is nothing to brag about, but you are on a boat after all. On the way back several people got sick because of the waves caused by the weather system. That is the way with vacations. You can't plan the weather.

Extremely primitive. I understand them not wanting to change anything but you put picnic tables out there. Why not put some shade? Everybody was trying to gather up underneath the tiny bit of shade they could find. The fort itself was ok being able to go on the rooftop and take pictures of the beautiful scenery was nice. I really don't recommend it, unfortunately. It was a two and a half hour, sea sickening, and rough boat ride. You can take an airplane out if you want to spend that much money.

If it were 30 minutes from Key West and cost about one-fourth of what it does to visit, I'd say ""Go for it!"" But that's not reality.

After touring, we went snorkeling down by the old, rotted pier. It was, by far, some of the best snorkeling we have ever done. We saw LOADS of fish and coral! It was beautiful!!!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We loved this trip and we made the trek from Islamorada to get there by 7:15a. Well worth the time and even the money. The trip is pricey on the Yankee Freedom but if you can swing it the park is incredible. It is almost a 2 1/2 hour trip out into the Gulf of Mexico but once you get there the snorkeling and the touring of the fort will more than take up your time and when it is time to go you most likely won't be ready. Too many places to swim and too much fort to see. Great scenery, fascinating history and lots of relaxation, all you can ask for in a day trip. Park in the lot across from the terminal if you can. $14 for the day.

A few recommendations: 1) Take the early morning seaplane to get there quickly. The seaplane guide and views is a great time in itself. If you do the morning trip you'll miss the crowds that arrive on the ferry when you are leaving. 2) Take a good camera if you have it. There are lots of great photo spots.

I think one of the gems of the place is the little bookstore and worker. He was very nice and helpful...even gave us some dinner ideas for Key West.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"About 70 miles west of Key West is Dry Tortugas National Park a group of islands that make up what is considered America's most isolated National Park. Getting there is only possible by boat (private or ferry) or by seaplane. I've made the trip twice and for those that can afford it the seaplane is in my opinion the best way to go! Most visitor's main reason for making the trip out is to see Fort Jefferson,a Civil War era fort that is considered the largest brick building in the western hemisphere. I'll encourage visitors to read up on the fort's history before going. If taking the seaplane the birdseye view of the fort and surrounding waters is sure to impress even the most jaded traveler. After seeing the fort do take some time to snorkel the crystal clear waters surrounding Garden Key where the fort is located, all types of colourful fish can be seen among the rocks along with the occasional barracuda or large grouper.

The guide in charge spoke too long and after a while he was annoying with his constant yapping…the boat ride is a 2 hour ride and if the weather is good you can be on the boat deck and you might even see a dolphin or two, we did.The boat offer you breakfast – its OK, and the include lunch as well but you must go back to the boat while you are the beach and have it there. Food is basic but its clean.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We wanted to try this excursion for past few years, but it always sold out before we could book it. We were afraid of getting sea sick if we traveled by ferry, so we decided to arrive by seaplane. It was expensive but well worth it!! We were able to view sea life from an aerial view, it was a 35 minute trip each way, and the pilot was friendly and informative. We were able to snorkel, explore the grounds, and relax under a shady tree. I really wish we would've attended the guided tour, but we found plenty to do on our own for our first trip. I would definitely do the tour next time! Although we're not campers, it seems like it would be amazing to camp there overnight. Sea Adventures provided a small cooler and complimentary bottles of water, and I would suggest bringing snacks being you cannot buy anything at the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped here one night and had the adventure of a lifetime. It was hard due to the heat but it was so worth it. I would love to camp longer but at a time when the heat and humidity isn't quite so bad. We are from Ohio so we really struggled with it, especially at night. I'm not sure any of us slept more than a few hours. With that said, this place is unbelievable! The boat ride was smooth, breakfast and lunch were great. We did take some dramamine before we left because I've gotten seasick before but wasn't sure how the kids would react to being on the boat. My husband and kids all fell asleep after breakfast and woke up when we were almost there. Since we were campers we had to stay on board to get the info about that but I did leave the boat with everyone else to go nab our camping spot. It was important that we had good shade. We were able to get a nice spot from some family that was leaving. While the day trippers were there we explored the fort and island and then after the day trippers left we snorkeled and it really was like having the island to ourselves. At sunset we then went into the fort and got to see a presentation about sea turtles and then go watch a release once it was really dark. We all got to wear special headlamps. It was really cool and something the kids will never forget. One of the best things I liked about the park was being away from everything. It was so secluded, no cell phones or internet or tvs. It was just us and nature. It was so refreshing to see people interacting with each other and nature. I only had one disappointment on the trip and that was the night sky. I had read and seen pictures about how amazing it would be but when we were there it was a very full bright moon. And then there was a storm out to seas so it was dark on one side and super bright on the other. Granted, the moon was beautiful but I had really been hoping for the amazing skies I had heard about. I am SO glad we did this and yes it's a bit pricey but very much worth it. And if you are campers or up for the adventure, I highly recommend it. As much fun as it is being out there for the day trip, it's 1000x better being there when the day trippers are gone. It's only you, a handful of people and a park ranger. You couldn't be more remote than this.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park was in my bucket list and I got to go this May 2017. It was truly worth the 2-1/2 hour boat ride from Key West. The Yankee Freedom ferry leaves the port at 8 am but boarding starts at 7 am (6:30 am for campers). You need to book in advance to ensure your seating particularly during the summer months when the waves are not as strong. Cost is $175 per adult or $125 per child with a $10 discount for seniors, children or active military with IDs. The ferry ride includes breakfast and lunch. It includes a mask and snorkel but no fins nor life vests. Those who get motion sickness need to bring their own medication. Towels are not provided. Bottled water to bring down in the beach area is recommended.Upon arrival at about 10:30 am, the crew prepare the snorkel gear on the dock at Dry Tortugas so the passengers have time to tour Fort Jefferson which is a six-sided building constructed of 16 million handmade red bricks. We started snorkeling on the north side of Dry Tortugas but the current didn't allow us to go to the broken wharf where most of the fish were seen by other snorkelers. We then walked over to the south side of the island and saw a lot more fish near the walls. There were lots of sea grass which are deliberately not removed for ecological purposes. Scuba divers seem to see a lot more marine life further away in the deeper waters.Overall, the experience was worth the cost. It seemed too short since we had to return to the boat by 2 pm giving us effectively only 3-1/2 hours to enjoy the marine life and the fort. The choppy seas were only experienced as we approached and left Dry Tortugas so the rest of the ride was comfortable.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband really wanted to go to Dry Tortugas, so I, being the good sport I am, said OK...despite the 2.5 hr boat ride (one way)! If I had to do this over again, I would bite the bullet and take the seaplane.The breakfast & lunch on the boat were nothing at all to write about, especially the breakfast - I think they could have done a LOT better with the choices than what was offered! Lunch was pretty much cold cut sandwiches, fruit, chips. To take with you on the trip: Hat, sunglasses, beach towel if you want to snorkel or some beach time, sunscreen, maybe some alternate snack things, headphones/music to pass the time! The PA system on the boat is NOT good, especially if you're outside. We could not hear what was being said about signing up for tours on the island or info on snorkeling (snorkeling gear included in the price)....so pay attention!! LOL I highly suggest taking the guided tour that is included in the price. However, we somehow got in the wrong tour, I asked our guide if I was suppose to be on another tour & he said it was OK to stay where we were. Apparently it was not, because we ended up in a group from some motorcoach club & they were very rude about us being on ""THEIR"" tour. We ended up walking away from the rude people on tour. I REALLY wish the tour guide would have said we needed to be on the next tour, instead of fluffing us off as OK! So, we missed out on 2/3 of the tour! :( The boat ride back seemed like an ETERNITY..again, if we were to go back to Dry Tortugas, we would do the Seaplane instead.","June 8, 2017","Glad we went, but boat ride is LONG!",102,"Columbus, Ohio",4

Take the tour that is offered if you are a history buff. The guide is full of information. Then,head out for some snorkeling after enjoying a lunch provided as well. We snorkeled around the whole fort. The tarpin were unbelievable (and huge). The coral was beautiful. Definitely worth the cost and the time!","June 7, 2017",A Must!,1,,5

They serve breakfast and lunch on the boat. The food was good. Upon arrival, we stayed at the park for 4 hours (which was plenty of time for walking around Fort Jefferson and snorkeling). This was my second time snorkeling. There is a shallow water (approx 5-7 feet area) that you can snorkel and see beautiful coral and tropical fish. In addition, for those who do not snorkel, then you can enjoy some time on the beach or a guided tour of the fort. ","June 7, 2017",Honeymoon getaway ,19,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

There is a bird sanctuary, a few small swimming beaches and very good snorkeling next to the fort. All types of coral, fish, sea turtles can be seen.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Decided to try this national park with my friends and family. It's about about a 2.5h ferry ride to the park with breakfast and lunch provided. I would recommend eating breakfast before if the opportunity arrives. Breakfast provided included: cereal, hard boiled eggs, fruit (canned), milk, OJ, bagels with cream cheese. Lunch included: deli meats (ham or turkey), white/ wheat/ rye bread, condiments (mayo/mustard), lettuce, tomato, cheese (American/ Swiss). Water is available on the ship and other drinks or snacks are available with a charge. Admission to the park was $175 per person, which I thought was steep going into the park and coming out of the park. Upon arrival floods of people disembarked and either snorkeled or took the tour of the fort. We decided to walk around the fort then snorkel (since gear isn't available until around 1045-11am). Snorkeling was nice, but there are better places to snorkel in Florida. We were lucky the sun came out and allowed us to see the coral and fish around the fort. We were able to spend about 4 hours at the park. Wish the park were closer so that more time could be spent and admission cheaper. Would have been more worth the price.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped here for two nights this past week in campsite #7. Our family of five loved every single minute of it. We had a nice, shady campsite with this amazing ocean view. Our site did get a bit windy at night, but it was actually quite nice in that we were never hot or uncomfortable. The snorkling was the best of anywhere we have been. The yankee freedom provided the snorkeling gear for our stay, and we snorkeled every morning and afternoon. The best thing about camping is, the ferry is only there from 10:30 am to 3 pm. And when they leave, the whole place is yours to share with just a few other campers and visitors from the sailboats anchored off-shore. We snorkeled all the way around the fort - there is beautiful, vivid coral all along the fort walls (especially on the north beach side). We saw countless reef fish - it was like swimming thru the Finding Nemo movie! There were angelfish, parrot fish, balloonfish, even these odd little octopus. Most of the time we didn't even know what we were seeing, but they were all just incredible species. The barracuda's however, those were a bit scary. They are easily identified because they are just downright unfriendly looking. You know when you see them, that wow...that fish has sharp teeth. We never felt to be in harm's way for a second though. I would advise to swim with a partner and to keep safety in mind. The water in the Dry Tortugas is indescribable - it is so blue and clear that it looks photoshopped. And the sunsets will take your breath away. This is definately a trip to remember. Tips - the ground is super hard. Bring air mattresses, you will need them! There is so much to do here with snorkeling and touring the fort - don't waste a bunch of time grilling elaborate meals. We kept it simple with frito chili pies (add chili, cheese, sour cream, etc to individual bags of frito chips), grilled hot dogs, tortilla shells that we used to make scrambled egg & conecuh sausage wraps with for breakfast, or to make grilled cheese quesadilla's or burrito's filled with refried beans. Not exactly healthy food, but quick and easy. You can get back on board the ferry when it is in if you need anything - extra ice, food, or if you just want to use their nice overhead showers that are on the back of the ferry to rinse off. It was a perfect trip for my family - a ""bucket list"" type of adventure that the kids will surely never forget.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We finally made the trip to the Dry Tortugas. Each time we've stayed in Key West, it's been for three or four days — this time was a 10-day stay. Previously, we didn't want to expend an entire day visiting this remote national park — it appears to be the 7th least visited national park in the system; the least visited is above the arctic circle. Anyway, to get there you have to go either by ferry (a 2 1/2 hour trip each way) or by seaplane. Prices on the ferry are $175 per person (you save $10 if you are in the old group; you also get entrance fees back if you have a national park pass). A lunch is provided along with a continental type breakfast (included in your fare). This was a fascinating day. Fort Jefferson has an interesting history starting before the Civil War. The waters are pristine. You can snorkel or swim. Camping is allowed; however, you should do your homework before attempting to overnight there. One recommendation: BOOK EARLY!!! We booked a week out and were limited as to what days were available. Also remember, your trip can be cancelled if the weather is stormy — that is determined by the captain of the ferry. Weather can be lousy there while it looks nice in Key West . . . or vice versa. If you decide to take the seaplane instead of the ferry, the prices are much higher. Check it out to see what is best for you.","June 2, 2017",Worth the Visit — Especially if you are a history buff — but BOOK EARLY!!,64,"Kingsport, Tennessee",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This National Park is considered the most difficult to get to, but I'm sure that's a matter of opinion. If you live in Key West and own a boat, it's a snap! The only way onto the island is by boat or seaplane, so your options if you don't own a boat are to come in by ferry, or to book a seat on a seaplane through a company in Key West. We chose the latter, and at the end of this review, I'll give you some info on that. But first, the park itself. There's a large, unfinished fort on the property. It has historical significance, architectural interest, and by climbing to the top you get a great view. It's not in use for military purposes, but the people who work on the island are housed there (interesting info as to how that works - the guy in the gift shop enlightened us...). Other than their living quarters, you're free to walk through, and you can see through photos that the arches and the windows framing gorgeous blue waters make for great photo ops. Once the ferry arrives, just inside the fort walls there's a talk about the fort and its history - definitely worth it.There's great snorkeling - we saw several barracuda (or one who was stalking me, perhaps?). Even if you choose not to go into the water, as you're walking down the cement/brick walkway shown in the main photo on this listing, the water is clear and shallow, and you can see large schools of fish of all different colors. Some make it into the ""moat"", the area enclosed by the wall, and obviously there are some on the ocean side.There is plenty of room to get some sun. The beach was relatively small where we entered to snorkel (with sharp rocks/shell pieces in the sand - wear water shoes!) but there's also a large grassy area in front of the fort if you couldn't find a spot on the beach.There are picnic tables. They had rat traps on them, which made the idea of a picnic not too appetizing, but the traps were empty, and small enough that you could sit at the other end of the table to eat your lunch. We brought Subway sandwiches in a cooler provided by the seaplane company, and those coming over on the ferry have lunch provided as part of their trip.There's wildlife. Or animals, I guess I'll go with. One of the rangers' dogs came over with the rangers' wife, and a dog came over on the ferry, but in addition (and in addition to the rats that the traps are for, I guess...) are seabirds (the pelicans were happy to pose for photos) and hermit crabs - wild hermit crabs. Previously I'd only ever seen them for sale on the boardwalk at the beach. They were all clustered at the base of 2 trees flanking the walkway onto the island, and we were fascinated watching them climb the tree or leave a trail as they dragged their shell through the sand. What's not there? Most signs of civilization. No hotels, no restaurant, no cars, no shopping (a small National Park gift shop, with sunscreen and sunglasses, but no food of substance or swimsuits or anything else). There are camp style-type restrooms (that are locked while the ferry is in - it's a deal they park service has with the ferry - the ferry has to allow those on the island - whether they came over on the ferry or not - the use of their bathrooms) and places to pitch your own tent, but no tents or structures to camp in. No lifeguards, no phones (we did have cell phone service) and no lockers (we left phones, tablets, and cameras on a picnic table while we snorkeled, and had no problems) and few people working there - we saw 2 uniformed rangers, but it's a fairly broad expanse, so you'd have to look to find them (there's no guard shack or ""office"").For those interested in the seaplane option, my biggest question while planning was whether to do the full or half-day trip. Having told you what the island holds, you can probably decide for yourself what interests you and for how long it might hold your interest. We ended up being pleased that we booked the full day. We probably could have left an hour earlier and been happy, but we wouldn't have been ready to go when the 1/2 day was up. I will say that the time between when our plane arrived and when the ferry arrived was lovely - the 10 or 12 of us from the plane were the only people on the island (besides the employees and the few campers who'd stayed overnight). There was no motion sickness in our group from the small plane (apparently that's partly because of the stable temperatures and the ocean not being choppy there) and we saw sea turtles, sharks, shipwrecks, and beautiful blue-green water from the plane. By keeping the same seat coming and going, you get to see what's on both sides of the plane in one direction or the other. You also wear a headset to get both the pilot's narration and piped-in music. One word of caution - compare the time on your timepiece (watch, phone, whatever) with the pilot's once you land at the National Park. One couple on our trip almost missed the flight home because their ""smart"" phones changed time zones, and they thought they had an hour left when the rest of us were boarding the plane.","June 1, 2017",Great mix of history (the fort) vacation (beautiful beach) and thrill ride (the sea plane),450,"Winter Garden, Florida",5

Opted to go snorkeling immediately upon our arrival, then self-guided tour of the Fort. Water was cooler (still nice!) there than around Marathon. Windy days had stirred up the silt, so had quite a bit of turbidity, limiting underwater visibility. Be prepared for stronger ocean currents - not as sheltered as some areas. Boat provides fresh-water warm showers on the deck (NOT private!) after swimming. Changing rooms on the dock at Dry Tortugas. Not a lot of extra time to see it all - they do offer the ability for campers to take their gear including kayaks out - would be worth considering in the future if you wanted to see more of the area.

We opted for the 20 min version and then explored on our own. His knowledge and insight on the island was wonderful. After touring the fort we snorkeled and spent time enjoying the beach.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We went on a family vacation to Key West and decided to take the trip to Dry Tortugas National Park with our 2 teenage sons. I felt that it was really expensive, but had read reviews and since everything we did was pricey in Key West anyway, thought why not. I have to say that this was money well spent. It was about a 2 hour boat ride from Key West and it was a nice ride on a large boat. I can't remember the name of it, but it included breakfast and lunch for the day trip and even though it was mostly sandwiches, fruit and such the food was actually really good for both meals. Once you get there out in the middle of nowhere this Large Fort sits in the middle of the ocean among a few other tiny islands. It was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The water was crystal clear and the most gorgeous color of blue. We snorkeled around the outside of the Fort, and it was incredible. There was a good variety of fish and coral and there were some schools of fish that contained literally millions of tiny fish that you could swim through and it was really cool. Plus you are just 5 to 20 feet from the edge of the Fort in water that in most places that is only 3 - 8 feet deep, so it you feel like if something happened and you really needed to you could just stand up. Felt very safe compared to the snorkeling trip I took 2 days before where we were dropped off in the middle of the ocean and felt very vulnerable in the very deep water. The Fort itself was really interesting with a very rich history and great for taking pictures. You can also make plans to camp here overnight which is now on my bucket list of things to do, I can only imagine how many stars there are here at night. There is no electricity or fresh water on the island though, so if you camp here you have to bring everything with you.","May 24, 2017",5 stars is not enough.,13,"Greenville, Texas",5

Check out the innovation in the Fort - cannonball firehouse was interesting. The visitors to the park are controlled by access - only the ferry (Yankee Freedom), sea plane, or private boat Charters can get you there. Ferry books up weeks in advance. We didn't know that so couldn't get on. Ferry trip is long and relatively expensive ($175). We took the seaplane. Cost more ($330) but we got there quickly, the flight was a highlight of our vacation, and we got to Dry Tortugas before the ferry so we got to explore before the crowds arrived. Highly recommend if you can afford it. Half day seaplane gives you almost as much time on Dry Tortugas as the ferry.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited in May 2017 and it was hot and sunny with no shade to be found....but was totally worth it by camping out. If you don't camp out, I don't believe it's worth your time to take the ferry. It ends up being about 5 hours on a ferry and 4 hours on the island, and the ferry ride itself isn't particularly entertaining. BUT, if you do the appropriate planning, doing a night or two of camping is the same price + a $15-$20 camping fee, and you'll have over 24 hours at this unique park. Camping is definitely not for everyone (and definitely not for younger kids), but if you have pretty basic camping skills, you'll find yourself mesmerized by the isolation from the world that you get once the ferry and seaplanes leave. I would highly recommend this for anybody that is looking to escape the world for a couple days to just simply relax and explore the ocean and Fort Jefferson.On another note, the ferry captain was exceptional. I realized on our trip over I had forgotten to pay for parking and explained the issue to the captain before she departed. She had no problem helping us out and paying for our parking once the ferry got back and having us pay her back when she returned the next day. She saved me a hell of a headache from being towed and paying whatever parking fee that I would've been charged. I would not have expected that sort of help out of any ferry crew ever.

It was simply stunning!","May 22, 2017",Breathtaking,5,,5

Our pilot Gary, a former Alaska bush pilot, was fun to be with and helped make the trip very enjoyable. It's impossible to fully describe the wonderment of the four hour trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Interesting place and beautiful beach...something that's hard to find on Key West. We took he ferry and it is 2.5 hrs. (each way) and, with choppy seas on the way back, more than a few were using the bags they handed out. They offer dramimine (sp) for the trip and my husband and I took the offer and we were just fine.Hollywood, our tour guide on the ferry, was great at imparting dry, historical facts about Fort Jefferson while making them funny and interesting. Good at what he does!The price for the ferry includes a light breakfast, lunch, including non-alcoholic beverages, and after 2pm, wine, beer and cocktails are available for purchase.The only problem with the trip was that there were few fish and wildlife to view while snorkeling. We didn't even see dolphins or turtles there or even en route. I will say that the gear did fit well and they had a changing room to get into and out of your swimsuit. All the crew and staff were friendly and informative. If you go on this trip, bring your passport as they have a stamp in their gift shop.","May 21, 2017",Beautiful and historic place,44,"Washougal, Washington",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is remote and only accessible by boat, ferry or seaplane. Fort Jefferson is located about 70 miles off key west. We chose to take the Yankee Freedom Ferry out of Key West for a day of snorkeling, bird watching and touring the fort. The ferry allowed more time to visit than the seaplane option. The ferry ride is about two and a half hour ride. The staff were excellent. Our fare included breakfast and lunch and park access. If you are a national park pass holder, you are reimbursed the entry fee (good for up to 4 people in your party). You will need to show your pass at check in. I'd recommend booking well in advance during season. They offer senior pricing. I think the capacity is about 175 passengers. There are rest room facilities on the ferry. You can change into bathing suit at the fort. There is a designated beach area and snorkel area. No access from the mote wall. We saw a lot of fish in the clear water. The crocodile that lived here was recently relocated to the Everglades National Park. (do not feed any wildlife). There is a bird nesting area here that is off limits. In migration season you will see many birds. This is the beginning of the Florida Birding Trail. There is a bird listing kept in the office/gift shop area. While in this area, don't forget to get your park passport stamped. You can sign up for a short or a long tour of the fort (included in the price) or tour the fort on your own. If you are a camper, you can make reservations to camp here. (check national park website). You will need to carry in and carry out all your gear/trash. Just a note of caution: If you think you might get seasick, take along Dramamine. They sell it at the terminal if you forgot it. Just an ounce of prevention. Several people were throwing up on the way back because it was windy, with high seas. If you are interested, the bar on board opens around 2 pm for adult beverages and snacks like chips, hot pretzels and pizza. This is a must do item and it takes all day from around 7 am - 5 pm. Plan on a nice dinner when you return to the dock, there are many many choices or head over to Mallory Pier for a beautiful sunset.","May 20, 2017",Not to be missed!

The actual fort is huge, interesting, great to walk around, views are incredible. We attended a 20 min talk by one of the crew and it was great. We chose to snorkel after exploring which worked out great. It was a hot day and the water was fantastic. The fish around the piers were also good. Calm sea while there makes all the difference. The trip back was a bit rougher, some rain showers, but overall a good day. Keep in mind you have to book way in advance; the weather will make or break your day.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"In theory, this should have been a fine day trip. But theory and practice do not always coincide. My wife loves to snorkel. I on the other hand, am a 18th-century military history buff. But the much-praised snorkeling was a complete washout. In fairness, the winds had been up for several days. The massive 3rd System Ft. Jackson was interesting for about 5 minutes. That left another 145 minutes. Eat lunch? Sure, but the cold cuts buffet offered gratis aboard the Yankee Freedom III didn’t appeal in the heat. That left another 2 ½ hour voyage back to Key West. Best thing about this pretty expensive ferry ride was the skipper’s dog, Maddie. By prior arrangement, some folks arranged to camp out overnight. Can’t imagine why.","May 18, 2017",Waste of a day,31,Iowa,2

We really didn't need to bring any food with us as they fed you breakfast and terrific lunch, then later you could buy drinks and snacks. You can use their fresh water shower to get the sand off you and there are changing rooms on the dock. We brought our own snorkel gear and noodles, but they provide snorkel gear and even the vests, so we really overpacked for this trip. They don't fill the boat to capacity (think it's like 250) but stop at 180. There are no bathrooms at the fort but you can go back to the ferry with no problem. You could do this trip with a camp chair to hang on your back (and store behind your seat) . You can get all the water you want from the boat so bring an empty water bottle to fill and take to the beach. Great experience!","May 17, 2017",Wonderful trip,9,"Greenacres, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We've always talked about making the trek out to DT, more so, let's be honest, to check off another national park experience on our list than true desire to see the fort. But something else always seemed to take precedence. Recently, we finally committed to going, and OMG, we fully underestimated the sheer beauty and wonder of this place. If you enjoy natural beauty, this is a MUST! Choose a warm, sunny day, and commit to a wonderful, daylong trip; you won't be sorry. Yes, the boat ride out is long, but eat breakfast, breathe the sea air, visit with passengers, and be patient because the prize awaits. Make sure to stroll both the lower and upper moat paths all (or most) of the way around, try out the 20 minute talk or hour long tour if you're interested in the history, bask on the beach if you want, or fish. We tried the snorkelling, and saw fish yes, coral no. Not much of a snorkeling experience for us. BUT, then find a spot on the lower moat path, sit down, dangle your feet over the water facing the lighthouse on Loggerhead Key, and just gaze at the incredible array of colors in your vision 360 degrees around you. Feel the sun on your face, the breeze in your hair, and release that deep breath you've been holding. It's sublime. At 2:45, board the boat, and make sure to get a seat on the upper deck, facing the back of the boat. Grab an adult beverage, put your sunglasses in place, and just bask in the glow and ocean view all the way back to KW. The boat staff were fun, everything is well organized, and Joanne in the office was an amazing ambassador for the trip.

They run this tour like a well oiled engine so everyone gets the most out their time on the boat and the island.

The bird watching was also very, very interesting. The food was only OK but there was something for absolutely everyone - my husband and I are vegan. As far as I could tell from the other passengers the alcohol was well liked - I personally do not drink. A good time once but I don't know that I would choose to do it again.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We traveled to the Dry Tortugas in January 2017 with our 7 year old son. We arrived via the ferry, which took approximately 2.5 hours one way. Once at the national park, we had about 3-4 hours to wander around, look at the old fort, hang out on the beach and go snorkeling. Walking around the old fort, which was built in the mid 1800's was amazing and quite interesting considering how much history the fort has. In addition, the fort is still in remarkably good shape due to renovations by the National Park Service. You can walk up on the top of the fort on the upper walls and have a great view of the islands and sea around Dry Tortugas, which I highly recommend. The ferry company provided us with a downloadable history of the fort which I was able to read prior to arriving and made our self guided tour more informative and enjoyable.There are several small beaches around the fort which are good for sun bathing. We ended up snorkeling for a couple of hours around the outer moat walls and further out. I have done quite a lot of snorkeling and scuba diving around the world and I have to say that the fish I saw at Dry Tortugas were some of the largest fish that I've ever seen snorkeling anywhere. Near the outer wall, many larger fish like to come in and feed and I saw 5-10 large barracuda about 100 yards out from the beach, hanging out above the sea grass. The area around the fort stays shallow for quite a ways out, but I ended up swimming out to the buoys, where the water dropped to 20 feet and I saw quite a few more fish, decent coral heads, and quite a few lobsters hiding under the rocks out there. My son had a great time snorkeling and this area really provided him an opportunity to look at some bigger fish up close without having to swim a long ways out. We all had a great time and plan to go back to Dry Tortugas again, but next time would like to camp out for a night since 4 hours on the island was just not enough time to see and experience everything.

We booked this tour with one of their approved vendors that provided lunch once you got there so it was nice to take the food off the boat and just have a picnic. There are no trash cans around the island so I would suggest you take a small trash bag so you can dump on your way out instead of walking back to the entrance when you are done. It took 2hrs by boat to get there and it was a beautiful ride out to the island itself. Great way to spend the day. ","April 25, 2017",Must See and Visit,50,"Houston, Texas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our family (2 adults, 1 kid 8yrs) took the Dry Tortugas trip on Yankee Freedom III. Sadly, the weather did no cooperate as it was on and off rainy all day. That being said, the trip out was still wonderful! The crew on the boat were so friendly and organized. The main guide ""Hollywood"" gave such thorough information on everything involved on the trip. The tour included breakfast and lunch which was great! Plenty of offerings and all the food was very fresh. Snorkel gear was also included in the tour which was a big plus. Despite the weather, the fort was beautiful and unique. The tour of the fort was also very, very good. It makes such a difference when the person conducting the tour is genuinely interested in and enthusiastic about what he's telling you about. You were also free to wander around the fort and info to download an app for a self guided tour was provided before leaving Key West. The boat itself was lovely. Comfortable seating both indoor and out and everything was very clean - including the bathrooms. All in all, despite crummy weather, our family had a wonderful time and will absolutely book this trip again! A shout out to the crew that day who worked so hard and really contributed to the enjoyment of the trip. ","April 24, 2017",Amazing place,5,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Amazing snorkeling and bird-watching. If you enjoy snorkeling, be sure to visit the coal piers and go up and down the moat walls for the best views. Beware barracuda, though! The ferry trip is fun and relaxing with surprisingly good breakfast, lunch and drinks (for the trip home only). The fort itself is being slowly repaired - I've visited twice and definitely seen a difference. You can take a tour or wander around yourself - though be aware there are no handrails on the roof level so it can be a little scary. If you visit Key West, do NOT miss this trip. Be sure to set aside a day (and a lot of sunscreen) for a visit to Dry Tortugas.","April 22, 2017",Must-see,11,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,The Fort dates to the 18000 and is the place where Dr Mudd was incarcerated for aiding the assassin of Abraham Lincoln. A history buffs dream experience. You can also snorkel the beautiful waters surrounding the fort as long a you don't mind the threat of the resident crocodiles. It rained the day we were there but we still had a wonderful time and enjoyed seeing the many fish in the beautiful blue waters.Good shoes are a necessity as the floors of the fort are covered with projecting bolts and no handrail on the staircases.,"April 21, 2017",Fort Jefferson,8,"Clemson, SC",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was the big, exciting excursion for our trip to KW. I enjoyed the long boat ride out to it and overall it is pretty cool, but not as amazing as other reviews lead me to believe. Once there the fort is pretty cool, and there are some incredible views, but not all that different from Fort Zachary Taylor. You can't control the weather but it was very windy which made snorkeling very sub par. We saw a few things but the water was super cloudy and the visibility poor. One of the things we hoped to do was walk around the smaller surrounding islands and feel like we were on a deserted island paradise. Unfortunately those are off limits so we couldn't do that. By the time we had to leave we had done and seen everything there was to do, which is basically tour the fort and snorkel. The food served was awful, both breakfast and lunch. The trip home was into the wind and very bumpy. While we actually enjoyed it, others got horribly sea sick. I'm glad we went but for the money I'd recommend looking into other activities.","April 20, 2017",Not as amazing as I expected,25,"Painesville, Ohio",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,I definitely recommend this just to see this fort is pretty amazing and the fact that you can snorkel and see all kind of fish life is pretty amazing.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This place was jaw-dropping, speechlessly beautiful. There wasn't that much trash, and if you're concerned about the litter and giving this place a one star review, why don't you PICK IT UP YOURSELF!!! Jeez, it's all of our responsibility to keep our national parks clean. Don't just stand around waiting for a park ranger to pick it up! If everyone picked up a little, you wouldn't be complaining. That everyone includes YOU. I rate this place five stars because it was NOT filled with litter and any that was there was picked up (and not by park rangers.) The service was amazing and the view is amazing. This national park is one of my favorites with only Haleakala surpassing it. Everglades is a tie. Anyway, snorkeling here is not that great but come on there is so much else to do go snorkel in Hawaii. Swim, lean history, take pics, bird watch, camp, and so much more. Fort Jefferson was amazing and so was the tour. I threw up on the boat ride, but I still loved it, that's how good it was. I would go again even if I threw up because of the rocky waves and you should too.","April 19, 2017",*jaw drops open*,54,,5

Also wear water shoes or sandals in the water if you're not going to snorkel. A lot of broken off coral Pieces makes it a little rough standing in the water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We arrived via the Yankee Freedom ferry and the stunning beauty of Dry Tortugas did not disappoint! Pelicans on old wooden maritime posts greeted us as we docked. They gently took flight,ascending then diving for fish. We walked around the Fort between the moat and the sea. On one side were countless shades of shallow blue waters, creamy turquoise mixing to translucent green. The moat was a crystal clear light green color. We spotted purple needlefish and larger tropical fish. Somewhere we were told is the sole resident American Crocodile. We got our snorkeling gear and headed into the water. The 3 places we hit were on the dock side near some rusted out coral encrusted structures, the beach area and against the Fort wall. By far the most variety of fish for us was against the fort wall. We saw larger fish there and massive conch shells. There were also more interesting corals there. A better experience and use of your time snorkeling would be there! We saw thousands of Frigate Birds far down the island but getting close to them was not allowed. Checked out Fort Jefferson and walked on top after climbing some circular stone steps. Amazing views all around. No guard rails and a 40 ft sheer drop down to the moat so take it easy. What an experience!!","April 14, 2017",Absolutely beautiful!,0,"Denver, Pennsylvania",5

The ferry ride is a little steep, I believe we paid $150 per person, but it was well worth it. In fact, I would say it was the highlight of our trip to Keywest. You must take the hour long GUIDED fort tour and hear the fantastic story of how and why the fort was built. Our tour guide was great, but I am sure they all are. And although the ferry ride was long, it was fun! We met some great people and enjoyed breakfast on our way over and lunch while we were there. On our return trip they served some refreshing drinks!

We chose to check out the fort on our own for 30 minutes but then did a guided tour with Hollywood (a guide from the Yankee Freedom). His tour was excellent--funny, historical, and educational. It was about an hour long which was perfect. Lunch was available on the boat for guests, too.

The boat dock has saltwater hoses to wash off your feet before re-boarding the boat. Onboard at the stern of the boat are 3-4 showers to rinse off the salt water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I am a huge fan of the National Parks and you really need to be in order to visit Dry Tortugas. It's not cheap to get here and the boat ride takes 2 hours and 20 minutes roughly to get there. I recently took my wife and two kids and it was worth every dime.We saw sea turtles on the way out to the island. The turquoise waters around the island were even more beautiful than I had imagined. We snorkeled on both the North and South end of the island. The water was a little cold when we were there, (71 degrees) but we quickly got used to it. I think I liked the North end a little better than the south side. If you go out to the far end of the moat and turn left around the corner, we really saw lots of incredible fish including Barricudas, Conchs, Star Fish. Obviously you can see these things anywhere but that's what I experienced. The history here is equally interesting. If you know Civil War history, you know that Dr. Mudd assisted John Wilkes Booth with his broken leg after he assassinated President Lincoln. Dr. Mudd paid the price and served several years imprisoned inside Fort Jefferson. Seeing his jail cell was really interesting. 14 million bricks makes for an impressive structure especially when you consider it was built 150 year ago.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Visiting the ""Fort "" was worth every minute of the long ferry ride out and back. The water was too cold for me to snorkel so I spent all my time birding. So many species of birds; many of them were ""life"" birds for me (first time seeing them.)The Fort was interesting, there are overnight camping spaces that are available to reserve, but the water and sky are the main attractions (birds and fish.) I wouldn't bring small children. There isn't anything to occupy them and the walk around the exterior of the Fort is precarious at best.

Saw tons of birds on one side of the fort.We wanted to snorkel after lunch so we skipped the guided tour of the fort. We head down to the beach to snorkel and besides the water being chilly there weren't any fish to see. After 20 minutes we got out to warm up in the sun. There is not a reef here but we expected to see something more than minnows!My husband decided to walk through the fort on his own. Not much is inside so it's a walk through read plaques experience.Oh well I'm crossing it off the bucket list. I would not consider returning.","March 30, 2017",Disappointing Natl Park,401,"Fort Myers, Florida",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"You can get there a couple of ways, but we decided to take the Yankee Freedom ferry. Although it takes a couple of hours to get to the destination the crew was fantastic. The trip included breakfast, lunch, and snorkel equipment. The fort is impressive. The fact that something this large was built this far out is impressive. The snorkeling was better than expected and were allowed to enter several areas of the key. For bird enthusiasts Bush and Long key are right there swarming with a couple different species. Definitely worth a visit.","March 30, 2017",Great Experience!,11,"Jacksonville, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a seaplane here from Key West and spent half the day. There's a ton of history here, and we were fortunate enough to hear a lot about it on the plane ride over. The views are breathtaking from the fort, and they've done a nice job telling the story about the fort via signage as you walk around. You can also snorkel here (we did not as they water was a bit cold) or just lay on the beach and relax. Really cool experience. ","March 30, 2017",So Much History!,0,"Miami, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had an awesome tour of this formidable fort, made into a civil war prison. The history of this place is intense--hearing how each window was to house a cannon, how they foolishly poorly built their water cisterns, the cholera, the yellow fever, the famous prisoner doctor, Samuel Mudd, and his heroic feats which led to his future pardon--all these tales were fascinating. The location is gorgeously located in the middle of nowhere surrounded by those incredible Caribbean blue hued waters. But, the snorkeling is terrible. There's only sand and scattered sea grass, with little 3"" minnows. No reef at all. The ferry ride over was a bit rough, and a good many of us got sea sick. The staff were great with handling we 'green' passengers, and handed out little 'upchuck' bags and ginger ale to those of us suffering. This is an all day trip.Food is included but not good: The lunch that was included was quite bland--a platter of low grade lunch meats, a tub of sliced bread, a large tub of potato salad, pre-packaged chips, and a bowl some old, mushy watermelon chunks. Dried, hard cookies (chips ahoy style) were our dessert. Uninspired! Come on National Parks--get a new concessionaire! Breakfast was only a bit better: yogurt, cereal and milk, hard boiled eggs, but the fruit salad was old and tasted fizzy! When I mentioned that their fruit salad was fermenting, the staff person managing the bar just shrugged and couldn't have cared less.So, take a Dramamine, enjoy a 2.5 hour boat ride each way, leave your snorkel at home, walk the fort and take a tour (included for free). Grab a beer from the bar for the trip back.","March 29, 2017","Beautiful and haunting, but don't come to snorkel",27,"Columbus, Ohio",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,Very interesting fort from mid 1800's. The views from the top are spectacular. Pretty good shallow snorkeling...easy for people that are afraid of going into deep water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We stayed here for 2 nights and three days in Sept and it was Amazing!!! I will tell all I can about everything. The ferry ride to and from on the Yankee Freedom is fun , looking out over the water watch the ballyhoo leap and skip across the water, tons of wildlife including dolphins were seen. The crew were awesome and very helpful. The food was great and filling on the ferry . On arrival one of the Park rangers came out and I admit he was a bit full of himself . I think he had little mans syndrome and tried to make others feel stupid. Other than him( who we did not see again the whole time) the rest of the park Rangers were friendly , helpful and just great people. We unloaded and picked our camp spot. There are carts to help move your stuff. Almost all the spots have great shade. They are far enough from each other to give a sense of privacy. All the other campers were great and we loved getting to know them. Our one ""neighbor "" Josh from Destin was fun , outgoing and a joy to hang with. As were all the other campers , part of the fun is meeting them and sharing island life with them lol. There are hermit crabs everywhere and we loved them! Watch them come out in the evening as they search for food and water. The sunset is beautiful and takes your breath away. The water is crystal clear and perfect temp. We were there in Jelly Fish season but stinger suits let us enjoy the snorkeling with no problems. There are lots of colorful fish and and coral to see. At night after the boat leaves you have the island to yourself and fellow campers. That is when we would fish off the pier. Caught lots of fish , even got a bite from a HUGE shark. If you are going to fish make sure you have circle hooks and strong line. We had 50 lb test and our line was snapped again and again by the huge fish and sharks. They do have a net you can use to catch bait fish available just ask the rangers. Your kids can do some fun Jr ranger badges too. At night the sky is a majestic palette of stars so brilliant and of colors you cannot imagine . We used stove in a can to cook with and it worked great since many fuels are banned on the boat. If you have a battery operated fan bring it the nights can be still and warm in your tent . The Fort itself leaves you in awe as you walk around it. We walked the outer wall at night and did a little ghost hunting ;) . This is a place that will leave you with memories of a lifetime. Take a day or as many as you can and enjoy this National Treasure.","March 28, 2017",Your Soul Deserves this!,28,"Batesville, Arkansas",5

We got to explore the Fort and campgrounds, we saw a crocodile & spent the afternoon playang in the ocean and sunning on the beach.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The fort is huge and walking all the way around in the heat can be a challenge. I would suggest that you tour the fort first before the ground, etc. We did the opposite - walking around the grounds/moat before going inside to tour the fort and it was tiring during the mid-day sun. Wear comfortable walking shoes, it is a lot of walking!Bush Key was not accessible and the point up to which you can go to see the birds is not very close. You need REALLY long lens to take pictures of the birds. There is a small beach there but it is not very clean. There is a lot of seaweed in the water. Nonetheless, my son had fun in the water. It first the water is very cold and he went in around 1:30pm when the sun is high. It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get accustomed to the coldness of the water; after that it is enjoyable.","March 26, 2017",Lots of History,5,"Gainesville, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The park is interesting mostly for what it is: An old fort that takes up most of an island out in the middle of beautiful waters. You likely won't see anything like the park anywhere else. The trip to the park is either by seaplane (cool, we're told, but expensive) or the Yankee Freedom, a vessel that makes a day trip. You end up with about four hours at the park, which, unless you are camping, is all you need.You can snorkel, camp, picnic, walk, and hang out on limited white sand beach. There's a small, not very well stocked gift shop. Unlike other parks we've been to, the rangers do not give tours. If you take the Yankee Freedom, you can go on a tour with a crew member--which we don't recommend. You're fine just wandering and reading signs.The odd aspect of the park is that there really isn't interesting history there. The fort became obsolete as the US built it and so no events occurred to warrant mention in any history. In many ways, it's just a big old brick building.","March 26, 2017",Unique and Pretty,190,"Portland, Oregon",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,My husband and I were able to book a last minute reservation aboard the Yankee Freedom and I can't compliment this trip enough.

Now an isolated spot for camping, snorkeling and viewing some birds who use it as a stop over or rookery.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Booked Yankee Freedom ferry to Dry Tortugas which includes a two and half boat ride one way, with a capacity of 250 people, had 175 on our trip. Includes continental breakfast (bagels, fruit, cereal, ham, hard boiled eggs, coffee, juice) but only half and hour before they close, Buffet lunch which is a create your own sandwich, chips, soda. They do have bar to buy alcoholic drinks, sodas, water. Water ride can be rough going out and definitely will be challenging for those prone to sea sickness, so prepare accordingly). Fort is interesting, be sure and take steps up to top of fort to walk around the top of fortress walls, beautiful 360 degree views. Did not have enough time to try all of the snorkeling spots around fort. When you first come off boat we stopped at beach to left next to camping area. Snorkeling was not that good, not many fish, but the weather had been windy and water stirred up a bit. Two in our party went around left corner of stone wall there and said snorkeling was great. So definitely seems location and condition specific. When we were on top of fort the beach area to the right looked empty but on Atlantic side of fort. Water looked clear but we didn't have time to try it. No facilities on land except to change, restrooms on boat only, no concessions on land. Boat is clean, crew helpful. We liked the upper cabin at a table by window. Shaded but can walk to other parts of boat when you want sun and outdoors. They also have outdoors in the sun seats. Sun is very hot when it wasn't behind a cloud on our trip and hot in fort island. Had snorkeling been a better experience would have given this a five.

Winds were 15+ knots the day we went. The last 45 miles going out and the first 45 mile coming back are in deeper water and the seas were rough. Sea sickness for a lot of people, even some that took Dramamine. The fort was great to explore and the snorkeling was decent.

The half day trip was a little short for my liking, but I don't think I would sleep overnight given the 5 ft crocodile that was within 25 ft of the tents! (& I've heard the rats were horrible at night!)It was a very unique and great time had by all though.

The history of the fort is interesting but the swimming/snorkeling is the best. And the 360 degree views from on top of the fort are amazing!! The water was so clear and calm that day so could just float on my back. We saw some colorful fish around the pillars from a previous dock. Next time we want to camp. Drink plenty of water on the boat to prevent seasickness or take medicine. It's 2 hour boat ride from Key West and several people got sick.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is without a doubt the coolest thing we have ever done. I wanted to go for the history of Fort Jefferson and my husband was willing to go along. We were astounded by the beauty of the water, the island (and the fort, too). I have never seen anything so stunning, the photos online don't even do it justice. I could spend the entire day just standing atop of the fort and looking at the crystal water. Do note, though, that the beach is very rough, the sand that is there is more so a mix of broken up shells than regular sand you think of seeing at the beach. Might want to keep your flip flops on.Best way to experience it is to take a seaplane over from Key West, instead of the ferry. And go on the earliest flight (yes that will be pretty early in the morning but beyond worth it because if you do a half day, you are leaving by the time the first ferry comes over so you essentially have the island to yourselves). Also the seaplane is a tour, itself, and the pilot tells you all about the keys and the various wildlife you WILL see from the plane (countless turtles and then you'll see some other animals, too). Also if you fly, they will provide you with snorkeling equipment. My husband snorkeled in the crystal clear water while we were there and came face to face with all kinds of fish. It was an incredible experience for him and he still goes on about it. Unforgettable. Then you should also spend some time touring the fort. They have a tour that they do and you can also go on your own. We did it on our own so we would have time for snorkeling too. Just remember it's a dry island, there's no fresh running water so you will have to use the Porto-potty's and you will want to pack any snacks you might want (and drinks). The gift shop at the fort is really neat and they have a great selection of items to bring home. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone. The seaplane is almost twice the price of the ferry, but the ferry is really pricey for it just being a ferry (and it takes almost 2 hours to get over to the island, whereas the plane takes 40 minutes and you get an awesome tour with it!).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Overall a great trip. The ferry is really nice, but even so it can be a long ride there and back. Next time we’ll bring cards or something else to entertain ourselves. The time on the island though was great. We’d recommend going on one or more of the guided tours to hear about the fort’s fascinating history, before having lunch. There was plenty of time after lunch to explore the fort on our own, and to do some snorkeling. The day we went the water was very clear and with minimal waves, making for good snorkeling conditions. The tour itself was very well run by the crew who did their best to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves.","March 23, 2017",Unique Day Trip,264,Minnesota,5

The turquoise blue water had me just mesmerized by its own right! Was just absolutely nothing but beautiful!The Fort and it's history is magical in its own right as well. Entered through the main entrance, looking up, just amazing just how large this structure was! Learning about it in school I had imagined it would be a large structure, it was mind blowing how large it actually was! The history of it from its birth and where it is today had me simply amazed! There was a perfect amount of time to explore, snorkel, and enjoy the time on the Dry Tortugus! I'd definitely like to see it again and bring my 9 year old son!I will advise one thing! Well, maybe a couple things! 1. Bring sunscreen! I've never had sunburn, and I did this trip. My own stupidity thinking that I wasn't going to burn despite all the recommendation for it, I completely ignored it. Don't! 2. Bring lots of film/SD cards for your camera and extra batteries!

The views were beautiful. Snorkeling was only okay - we started at the wall and the most of our group called it quits - others went on to part of the old docks and they said it was better there. With it being later in the day, the sun was not at an ideal height and the waters were a bit churned up from choppy seas earlier in the week.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Spouse and I took the Yankee Freedom Ferry to the Park. All was great except for the weather. Wind was high and seas rough and many travelling keep busy using the “barf bags” provided we did not – we never felt the need. But when we got to the island – the wind had stirred up sediments around the Island and we decided not to do the snorkeling that we planned. You would not be able to see in the water. There are numerous reefs like areas available from the shore – but……. we did not snorkel. Snorkel equipment is provided by the ferry company gratis. Besides the weather, the ferry trip was educational and the breakfast and lunch provided very good. The Yankee Freedom tour leader also led tours of the fort for those who wanted it and he knew a lot of history and was very informative. I am glad we did that tour. Because we could not snorkel we walked around most of the island looking at wildlife – mostly birds, and there were many. Giant flocks of terns- several kinds, lots of pelicans, gull species, sandpipers and many birds we did not recognize. So a great place to visit, highly recommended. .","March 17, 2017","Great place, watch the weather",183,"Columbia, South Carolina",5

Also saw a few barracuda.There was also lots of interesting coral on the pilings. It was a little intimidating to swim among the pilings and not hit the coral or the pilings. We also walked around the fort grounds. You can climb stairs up to the top and walk around part of the outer walls. The fort has an interesting history and part of the island it is on is a protected bird area. We did the half day tour by seaplane and would have liked at least an hour more time.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The boat ride out was awesome. You can see for miles in every direction and only see ocean, birds, and maybe other boats. It's a long ride out, but the time passes pretty quickly. Once there, you can do a quick .6M walk around the moat of the fort, and be ready to start the day.Within the fort, there is plenty of information on the history of the Civil War-era space and the keys around it. You can see tons of frigate birds on a nearby key and swarms of other birds on the interior of islands nearby. Apparently sea turtles like these islands for hatcheries, so there is always a possibility of seeing those as well. We saw just one on our trip, and that was as we were on the boat a bit away from the park. They dive quickly, so you'll need to keep your eyes peeled if you want to view one.Snorkeling on the North Shore is much better. If the water is choppy, then the elderly and young swimmers should probably choose to snorkel on the south side where the water is calmer. However, if you're a fine swimmer you should do the north side, where the water is a bit clearer and the sealife diversity is greater. Swim around to the pilings. We saw a lot of different fish on the way to the pilings. Also cool, an alligator lives there and has apparently been there for over a decade. We saw it sunning on the side of the moat. It lt's long, maybe 8 or 9 feet, but has never harmed anyone.","March 13, 2017","Incredibly cool experience, must see when in Key West",9,New York,4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was seriously one of the best experiences that I have ever had in my life! If you have the choice, then I would recommend flying vice taking the ferry - it saves alot of time. Be sure to go on the earliest tour possible - it gets you to the island early and you will avoid the crowds. The ferry doesn't arrive until 10:30am, so you'll have a couple of hours to yourself before the masses arrive. Be sure to take a camera, bathing suit, towel, water and snacks. When you get to the island, time will pass faster than you expect. We did a half-day tour and wished for more time, because we were having such a wonderful time exploring the ruins of Fort Jefferson, walking the beaches and snorkeling. Even if you think it'll be too cold to snorkel (we went in Jan), take a bathing suit anyway! Trust me, if you love swimming and the beach, you'll regret not taking a dip in the gorgeous cerulean blue waters.

The snorkeling is crazy cold, and the north beach, which we were told was the better, was poor visibility. We were so cold we didn't check out the south beach, but wish we had as another visitor told us it was far superior. We had the rare treat of seeing the Florida Crocodile who lives there and doesn't tend to come out when people are around. The fort itself is very interesting with lot of info around to explain it's history. Loved walking around the top. We would definitely consider camping there.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited Dry Tortugas National Park on March 2, 2017 and couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day! Although there were a few things about the Yankee Freedom that I thought would make the boat ride more enjoyable, the absolute beauty of seeing Fort Jefferson from the boat and then getting to experience it first hand, made the trip well worth it! I downloaded the self guided tour on my phone and we walked around and took in the structure at our own pace for an hour or so. After that we went snorkeling and were not disappointed at the abundant sea life so close to the shore at both beaches. It was so amazing to think of how this structure was built and the history behind it all. The Yankee Freedom does a very reasonable job of getting you there and back, although the seating on the boat is very awkward and uncomfortable for facing people that you don't know. The food wasn't bad, but if you didn't hit the time frame given you didn't eat, so be aware of that for lunch. We took our own mask and snorkel and was able to get fins at the dock. I would also strongly suggest taking a change of clothes for the ride home. For most of the boat ride back we stood by the railing and actually saw a turtle and fish in beautiful clear water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you like to visit National Parks and have a day of time to spend getting to and from the park, make the trip. The Dry Tortugas is home to Fort Jefferson, a military fort that started construction in 1825. the Park Service has done a great job keeping the fort areas repaired, although it is obvious that the buildings are over a 100 years old. You can walk around the three levels of the fort including the top wall and go completely around the fort. You can also walk around the moat that surrounds the fort. Finally, there are swimming areas and the two outfitters who make the trip - seaplane and high-speed catamaran ferry - provide snorkeling gear as part of the total cost of their packages.The fort appears to be sitting right on top of the water as you approach and for the most part, that is exactly what it is doing. This was a great day trip, but you have to get to Key West first and then take the seaplane or ferry to the Dry Tortugas location. The seaplane trip is 40 minutes each way - the ferry takes a little over two hours each way. We took the ferry and it was fine. A separate review under American Freedom is provided as well.","March 10, 2017",70 Miles from Key West and Worth the Visit,56,"McLean, Virginia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"If there's wind and waves, you might get sea-sick and the snorkeling at Dry Tortugas will be poor. Big waves will ruin the visibility for snorkeling. Big waves will make the trip less enjoyable. I'm sure the ferry company has their own rules about when they cancel their trip. I would think conditions would be ideal when seas are 2 feet or less. It's fairly easy to check the marine forecast. Also, I found the folks at the ferry company to be somewhat helpful (but they probably still go out during less than ideal weather). Remember you will be on the ferry boat for something like 6 hours. Why would you go out when there's a possibility of sea-sickness or poor conditions. Also, you might not be bothered by big waves, but that doesn't mean that others on the boat will be so strong. I personally don't like watching other vomit.","March 9, 2017",Best done in nice weather. You don't want to do this on a day with wind or waves!!!,474,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin",5

They serve breakfast and lunch on the boat - which was nothing to write home about. One the island, one can tour Ft. Jefferson, camp, spent the day at the beach, walk the moat wall, snorkel or watch the birds on the adjoining island. It was a great day. A word of advice..take dramamine on the way out. the day seemed calm but the waves were 2-4 knots and people were getting sick.

One of the coolest highlights was seeing the onsite crocodile named Sharky. Not everyone sees the croc during a visit. We were lucky.

Nearly everyone on the boat got sick. It's not a short ride. Take Dramamine for motion sickness (which didn't even help me!). Once on land, we felt better and were able to enjoy a gorgeous view, unique and interesting location, lunch and a bit of beach. Bring a towel (we forgot).

One of the more difficult parks to reach since you have to get there by boat or seaplane. We did the day trip on the Yankee Freedom out of Key West. Raining when we left Key West but cleared & beautiful by the time we reached the fort. Staff told us trip would be ""bumpy"" & advised taking motion sickness tablets which we did - some folks sea sick. Breakfast & lunch on the boat were good, served buffet, nothing exotic but tasty & plentiful. Tour guide for fort was one of the crew on the boat and he did a good job although he could have shortened his descriptions & kept referring to us as ""you guys"". Tour lasts about an hour, so you have plenty of time to walk around and explore the fort on your own. The history & story of the fort is interesting including how this & Key West were controlled by Union forces during the Civil War while FL was in the confederacy. Most disappointing part of trip was snorkeling - we're experienced snorkelers and we couldn't find anything worth seeing - maybe just couldn't find the ""right spot"" but this is an area the boat's crew could have been more helpful - they hand out a paper map with snorkeling area marked and we were quite sure we were in that area but couldn't find anything interesting and we didn't talk with anyone who saw a lot of fish.

These guys are true professionals and they work hard to see that we are well fed, well cared for, and available to answer any and all questions during the voyage.The park itself is nothing real special. There is an old fort that is currently undergoing repair on one side, thus limiting some picture taking unless you want scaffolding in your photo. The interior of the fort is interesting, but be careful. At some parts you reach the top of a staircase and there are drop-offs with no railings only 6-8 feet away. The views from the top are really nice and provide wonderful photo opportunities.We didn't snorkel, but we did sit on the beach in the surf. We saw a sea turtle only about 30 feet offshore. There is plenty of time to tour the fort, eat lunch and snorkel. Bring sunscreen, towel and a hat. The boat serves breakfast and lunch and provides refreshments. Also, restrooms are available on the boat, so you really don't need to bring much. It is a whole one day visit since the boat ride is about 2.5 hours each way.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We booked our trip on the Yankee Freedom III 9 months in advance as we wanted to camp for 3 nights out on Garden Key. From everything we read, a quick day trip was not enough to experience everything that the park has to offer. As it was, we were sure glad we did, because 3 days was still not enough to see and experience it all.The Dry Tortugas themselves are a beautiful treasure - the turquoise waters are a sight to behold - when you arrive, it is just breath-taking. The ride out on the Yankee Freedom was wonderful, we were met by one of the rangers who came on board to give us campers a quick introduction of the camp regulations. My review from this point on will be for camping on Garden Key:When I booked our reservations 9 months prior, we were the first and only ones at that time to book. But when you arrive, you are not necessary guaranteed a campsite. Yes, they say they will only bring out a certain amount of campers on the boat, but they have 8 campsites and then an ""overflow"" camping area. When the boat pulled in, we noticed that there were already a few tents in the camping area. When the ranger was done with his talk, I made a beeline for the campground, as did one other guy ""Jim"" who had previously camped there (he knew the drill and had ended up in the overflow camping area before) while my husband waited for our camping gear to be unloaded from the boat. ""Jim"" claimed his campsite and I claimed the only other one left in the regular camping area. There were no other campsites left. The other campers coming off the boat (about 10) had to camp in the overflow area, which is out in the sun and wind.We were disappointed at how close the campsites were in proximity to the other campsites - all within about 15 feet of each other, so it was definitely a lesson on togetherness. I was glad I brought earplugs as the first night we had to listen to loud laughter all night long on one side of us and the next night a 7 year old having melt downs constantly. It certainly wasn't the primitive camping experience we thought it was going to be. We had to laugh, though, because we are back country campers and took very seriously the Yankee Freedom's instructions on weight limits per person for what you could carry on the boat so we had a very minimal camp site. Some of the camp sites these people set up looked like they were at a state park campground tailgating - air mattresses in stand up tents with tent awnings, blenders for margaritas, coolers the size of canoes, tiki torches and twinkle lights, lounge chairs - we couldn't believe it. After we came back from snorkeling the first day, we discovered our new bag of charcoal had been opened and some of it had been stolen! The nerve! Had anyone asked we would have been happy to share, but to have one of our fellow campers steal charcoal made us very uncomfortable.The second night we got word from the rangers and the boat captain that a huge storm was moving in and we should think of evacuating, as the boat might not make it back to pick us up the day after the next when we had planned on leaving. They were expecting winds of 60 miles an hour. Park staff began evacuating and they began to pull boats out of the water and sailboats started to come into the harbor to seek shelter. That night we smiled to ourselves as the wind started to really pick up and the big tent awnings our neighbors had went FLAP FLAP FLAP in the wind, we heard one of them say ""Where is the hammer? I need to stake down the tents"". BUT, aside from the noisy and thief-among-us campers and the seaplanes and boats taking off all hours of the night and early morning, you can get out and walk the island and enjoy it at your leisure - enjoy the sunrises and sunsets and snorkel to your heart's content. Bush Key happened to be open while we were there and that expands your real estate quite a bit, if you are able to walk around the island, do! If you get to the very end, conch shells of all sizes have washed up on it and it is a sight to see - very cool.The fort is fun to explore, if you get a chance to talk with one of the busy rangers that is a plus, they are very informative but are there mostly for law enforcement and rescue so you don't see them very often. If you want a tour of the fort, be sure and take the one offered with the Yankee Freedom.The Yankee Freedom comes in daily and you can use the restrooms on board while they are docked (they close the pit toilets while the boat is in) you can also rinse off with the showers on board the boat and even buy lunch on board if you are camping and feel you want something more than camp food.We ended up having to leave a day early because of the storm that was moving in and the Yankee Freedom would not be returning the next day. We really could have used one more day on the island, as we felt we truly did not get to explore it fully. If we had to do it again, we would and understand that it is not a primitive camping experience but an island camping experience in a beautiful place with opportunities for snorkeling and exploration.

It is cold food and not the usual but there is plenty and varied. After reaching the island, a lunch is served on the boat, sandwiches, etc. Again, good buffet style, not fancy. You have about 4 hours to explore, swim, snorkel (equipment provided) or whatever. We found Fort Jefferson to be very interesting. Then we went to the beach but the water was too cold for us to swim, others did. On the ride back, there is a cash bar with food (hots, hamburgers, pizza, etc.) available at reasonable prices. The crew is super friendly and helpful but it was impossible to hear the video on how to use the snorkel stuff.Seating is tight but everyone had a seat and there seems to be enough room for all to sit at the tables (you will probably be sitting with strangers).It is a great trip and we will do it again if we are in Key West.","February 17, 2017",Day long trip and worth the time,36,"Rochester, New York",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife, daughter and I have had the pleasure of visiting Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas many times. We owned sailboats and a 48 foot trawler and were able to go there for a week or more at a time. Loved it! the fort is magnificent and huge. When you come towards it from the water all of a sudden this huge 3 story brick building looms out of the water. I think I read it took over 16 million bricks to build and some bricks came from Pensacola and the rest from New England. If you are a photography buff the architecture and arches are amazing. At one time there was over 2000 troops at the fort and as I recall they had to wear wool uniforms in the high heat and humidity of south Florida. If you are into snorkeling there is two beaches and if the current is right in the water it pulls you right around the whole fort slowly. Beautiful clear water and lots of fish. Watch out for a huge grouper that thinks he owns the third corner! The fort is very slowly being repaired. The window where the canon were had iron reinforcements and as it rusted it pushed the bricks apart. Loggerhead Key is three miles west of Fort Jeff and has a beautiful lighthouse on it. Then two miles south loggerhead and is a difficult to find a mooring ball on a reef where in twenty feet of water is what is left of a three masted schooner that hit the reef and broke into three sections over a hundred years ago. The bow sprit still sticks out above the water. If you get a chance go in your own boat (70 miles west of Key West) or a sea plane of the Yankee Freedom out of Key West. You'll love it.","February 15, 2017",Fortress in the middle of the Gulf,2,"Key West, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I booked this adventure because I got this terrible affliction called impulse buying, which Groupon takes full advantage of! I can tell you that there is no sailing on this adventure. The Yankee Clipper is under power the entire way, going and coming, and it departs from Key West on time, as advertised, so don't oversleep. I don't suggest that you imbibe heavily the night before either, because the outbound leg can make for a tough sail, especially if you are inexperienced. The crew provides an excellent orientation prior to departure. There were several bathrooms on the boat and I used 3 of them. I found each one clean and functional each time that I visited. The park was a treat and early February was a great time to visit because there was a consistent breeze and no humidity and no bugs. I am a history buff and I took my time exploring the Fort and imagining what poor Dr Mudd was experiencing during his stay. You should too! Do your homework beforehand and you will get a great deal more out of this experience than the standard tourist.The trip cost includes the use of snorkel gear. There was not much to see in the crystal clear water off the designated snorkeling beaches. Save snorkeling for your final hour because you do not want to be late for the lunch buffet, which was an excellent spread of fresh salad, lunch meats and cheeses, potato salad and fresh breads. The breakfast was not nearly as good, unless you like cold, hard-boiled eggs, which I don't. The boat departed on time, as promised, and was back in port by 5PM. You might make a 5:45 PM bus back to Miami Beach if your return sail had no problems. The walk from the Ferry Terminal to the Bus Depot is about 10 minutes. I think that a better alternative is to walk the Waterfront and experience a sunset at Mallory Square or walk the Waterfront and take advantage of the half price sales at the restaurants around the pier. Mojitos taste better when they are half priced, at least to me. Room rates were in the $180.00 per nite range at the hotels in the North Roosevelt Area for walk-ins. I even noticed some availability the Old Town Area, but not much. Alcoholic drinks on the boat are offered only after the boat departs the Dry Tortugas National Park. Expect to pay $10.00 with tip but I received a decent pour of rum in coke. I would not do this activity again. Once was enough for me. I have other activities on my ""to do"" list when next in Key West. This means that there are too many bars to visit, and too little time! Happy travels, everybody!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"When planning for our trip to Key West, we learned about Fort Jefferson which is located within the Dry Tortugas National Park. After doing the research, we quickly realized how cool a trip would be. We looked at taking the ferry service, but since so much time is spent driving on the boat, it doesn't leave much time to enjoy the island. So, we chose the seaplane option and while it was expensive, it was totally worth it. We really enjoyed seeing the sights from the seaplane and it was really a big part of the adventure. Arriving via seaplane, we were the first new visitors of the day. There were only a handful of people who camped overnight that were there so it was like we had the whole place to ourselves! Yet, another advantage of taking the seaplane over the ferry. We were able to explore around the fort and take in the incredible scenery all around us. After we were done exploring the fort, we took to the beach and enjoyed the best beach we ever found during our Key West trip. Since we were there so early, we had the beach practically to ourselves and enjoyed the amazingly blue water and a lot of snorkeling. There are lots of fish along the wall of the fort and there's plenty of other aquatic life to enjoy. Everything about our trip was awesome! Be sure to make the time to enjoy a trip to Fort Jefferson at the Dry Tortugas National Park and spend the extra money to travel down by seaplane.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is located 70 miles west of Key West, Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico so you must decide whether to take a two-hour chartered boat trip or a scenic and quicker but more expensive seaplane flight to Fort Jefferson and the westernmost and most isolated of the Florida Keys. Believe me, it's worth the time and/or the expense. The park, established in 1935, covers 64,701 acres and is noted for its abundant sea life, tropical bird breeding grounds, colorful coral reefs and legends of sea wrecks and sunken treasures. The park's centerpiece is Fort Jefferson, a massive but unfinished coastal fortress, the largest brick masonry structure in the Western Hemisphere, which is composed of more than 16 million bricks. It attracts only 63,000 visitors annually. Activities include snorkeling, picnicking, bird watching, camping, scuba diving, kayaking and saltwater fishing. The most famous person imprisoned at Fort Jefferson was Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. The first European to see Dry Tortugas was Juan Ponce de Leon, who visited on June 21, 1513. He caught 160 sea turtles and subsequently referred to the islands as the ""Tortugas"" or turtles. Why are they called Dry? Because there is no fresh water on the island. It is a bird-watchers' heaven with 299 species listed as residents. Of these, only eight species frequently nest within the park, including the brown pelican, mourning dove and magnificent frigatebird. Each year several bird guides offer tours of the park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species. It's an all-day activity. By boat, you leave at 8 a.m. and return at 5:30 p.m. Breakfast and lunch are provided. All at a cost of $135 per person. And they even provide snorkeling equipment.

If you don't like history, you're probably not going to enjoy it.The food? Your ride comes with breakfast and lunch. I read numerous complaints about it. The food is adequate. It's fresh and there's plenty of it. Again....THINK! It's a high speed ferry to a remote island. If you're expecting a gourmet meal for 200+ people, you've been holding your breath way too long on other snorkeling trips!The Rangers we talked with were friendly and knowledgeable. We had no problems there.All in all, it was a great trip. But I did my homework and knew what we were getting into.","February 6, 2017",Amazing,31,"Rainbow Lake, New York",5

I went on one of the tours provided by the ferry. He seemed to know what he was talking about. We stopped at several points inside the fort and on top. The views from anywhere are postcard worthy so a camera is a must. Snorkeling was good but the water was a little murky. Would love to go back sometime.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"There is plenty of history at Fort Jefferson unfortunately there wasn’t anyone that could impart that information to visitors. Having said that I was on a Seaplane visit that arrived at 8:30am, which was great since the only visitors were the 10 on the plane and the campers excluding the workers and National Park Rangers (that didn’t come on duty until 10:00am).• The flight enabled us to move about the Fort unencumbered to read signs and take pictures• The gift shop and Ranger contact was a little after 10am. Our group departed a little after 11am.• Due to construction parts of the Fort were off limits.• Locating Dr. Samuel Mudd’s cell was not easy. To save time it is located on the second floor above the entrance.• When the National Parks Ferry arrived 125 to 150 people unloaded and the Fort became crowded.• Restrooms were four port-a-potty’s located outside the Fort near the campground. Two for women and two for men. When the Ferry docks the potty’s are locked and you can use the bathrooms on the ferry. This is for environmental reasons.• There are NO representative period furnishings in any areas of the Fort. Near the gift shop there are artifacts to view.• The National Park Service is working to protect, stabilize and restore the Fort. In conjunction with this effort I would have liked to have seen some period furnishings to bring alive the history of the Fort.• Had I done more research before I went to the Fort maybe the visit would have been longer and I would have known about Ranger interaction.","February 4, 2017",Disappointing,68,Northeast Tennessee,3

The views from the Fort windows and roofline are unmatched in the Keys. The snorkeling reveals Fort ruins as well as a verdant, colorful reef ecosystem.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our family of five (kids 14, 11, 6) were thrilled to cross this National Park off our bucket list! I felt like the boat ride over was very organized and staff was professional. Despite giving our son multiple doses of dramanine he still through up multiple times. The crew are quick with the barf bags and give complimentary ginger ale to those who need it. Winter months bring rougher seas so keep that in mind. Water is colder and not as clear for those who choose to snorkle but that didn't keep my son who spent the ride over puking from having a blast! I will mention that if you want a tour of the fort make sure you sign up. A couple we sat next to were told there was no need to but when the showed up at the appointed time they were told the group was at capacity. I felt so badly for them. There is a self guided tour and also a short 30 minute talk as well.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I had an amazing flight and snorkel adventure at Dry Tortugas National Park! I went by myself but buddied up with a man who was also solo. Never snorkel alone. We were only on the island for 1/2 day which was not enough time. The seaplane flight was amazing! Well worth the money. Lots to see from sea turtles, ship wrecks, dolphins, and sting rays. Our pilot gave a nice narration going to the island and when returning. We quickly did a fast self guided tour of Fort Jefferson as we wanted to spend more time snorkeling. There is a very small gift shop and I did bring money to buy a dry-fit shirt that I love. There is a beautiful sandy beach to leave your gear. You don't have to take much (backpack with sunscreen, towel, & snack). They provided each person with a mini cooler with bottled water. I brought my own snorkel gear but you could also rent it. Very few people on the beach so your items are untouched. I spent a few hours snorkeling with my buddy. Water was crystal clear and warm. The wall was an interesting snorkel area but not a lot of sea life. Snorkel by the old pier. That was amazing! Highly recommend and would do it again! Book early as they sell out fast!","February 2, 2017",One of my most favorite adventure yet!,2,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My trip was a birthday present. Travelling in November the boat ride over was nowhere near as treacherous as the return trip. Dramamine is offered for a small fee. I highly recommend taking it if you are even slightly prone to seasickness. The trip to and fro had me vowing to take the sea plane if ever a return should come to pass. The place is a structural, historic, and nature marvel. The Civil War era fort is a testament to the will of man and a powerful United States.","February 2, 2017",The Dry Tortugas Fort is a Must See,12,,5

We went at 8am, and had 2.5 hours with only about 17 of us on the island before the cruise ship landed with another 200. The island, however, is big enough to accommodate everyone without feeling crowded. The fort is interesting to explore and provides terrific photo fodder. We were able to see a couple of birds we'd never seen before, and thoroughly enjoyed our time there.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you mention the Dry Tortugas to many people they will look at you with a blank stare. But for those that enjoy history and national parks it should be on your bucket list. Being 70 miles from Key West, it can only be reached by ferry or seaplane. We took the ferry ride, but caution everyone that it does get a little choppy and there were several people who got sick on the 2 1/2 hr ride each way. The ferry leaves at 8 am and returns at 5:30 each day. Cost is $175 a person, but that include entry fee into the national park so if you gave a senior pass for the parks you will get $10 off. They also feed you breakfast and lunch and supply snorkel gear for those who want to snorkel while there.Fort Jefferson makes up 85% of the island and the free tours are very informative as to why the US would build their largest fort ( it really is massive) 70 miles away from nearest land...between lunch on the boat while docked and exploring the fort you use up most of the 4 hrs you are on the island. The only restrooms on the island for the tourists are on the boat, and that includes those who stay on the island to camp overnight. Again...for those who enjoy national parks and history definitely a bucket list item... just bring dramamine...","February 1, 2017",Interesting and informative national park,22,"Kenosha, Wisconsin",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas was by far the best part of our trip to Key West. This is a full day excursion and I would suggest reading the website about what to bring, so that you are well prepared. The fort is amazing and the views are breathtaking. I enjoy photography so whenever I can I bring all of my gear and even though it was a lot to bring I would have regretted it had I not. The snorkeling is fantastic. We allowed ourselves about 2 hours to enjoy this. My best advice is to explore the fort when you first arrive and skip the guided tour (unless you enjoy that sort of thing).Don't expect an amazing lunch, because it's just cold cuts and chips. Snacks and drinks are also available at the concession stand, however while you are traveling to and from the island moving around on the boat proves to be quite the challenge.This is a must while you are in Key West and I can promise you it's worth it!","January 30, 2017",Wow!,1,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"What a REALLY cool and beautiful place! Be prepared for a long boat ride though. From what I've heard, sometimes the passage is pretty rough. We were fortunate to have a calm day. If you choose to sit outside, sit closest to the cabin to avoid being totally wind blown. The guides were fabulous and helped us understand why anyone would build a fort so far out. The water was vivid blue and crystal clear.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"There was a storm just before our visit to Dry Tortugas so the ride out was very rough. Many people got seasick. I have never had seasickness before despite being on cruises, etc, and even I felt a little nauseous. So the many reviews who mention this are not off base. The ride back was much smoother than the way in. Because of the recent storm, the snorkeling visibility was awful, could barely see the hand in front of my face, which is concerning to me being in the middle of the ocean. The staff was very friendly, the food was simple but sufficient. We didn't take the tour of the fort because our main goal was to snorkel, but in retrospect I really wish we would have. The beaches are small but it's still a good swimming area (the south beach is best), with lots of shallow area. Our kids had a great time swimming. The time on shore goes very fast due to transit time. I think this is a great place to visit for history buffs and if it's a clear,calm day probably great for snorkeling but since you have to book in advance that's a tough one to call. I don't really feel it was worth the money we spent, and that's unfortunate because this was what I was most looking forward to during our time in the keys!","January 30, 2017","Poor visibility on our trip for snorkeling, rough ride",16,"Rochester, Minnesota",3

The snorkelling was much promoted but I took my own gear but didn't use it because owing to the wind the water was opaque and anyway you could only snorkel in a couple of areas. The outward journey was horrendous going through the ""channel"". The boat was nice as was the breakfast and buffet lunch but apart from that it is difficult to find things to do for the remaining 4 1/2 hours. Although the return journey was smoother one couple summed up the day as ""enough is enough"". The price of almost $300 for two people should also be a slight disincentive.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We chose to go out to Dry Tortugas on the last day of our trip to Key West. We took the Yankee Freedom III. The boat ride each way was about 2 hours and 15 minutes. The weather could not have been more perfect, which may not always be the case obviously. Our high that day was about 80 with light southerly breezes. Upon boarding the boat, breakfast is served. Lunch is served from 11 to 1. Both are pretty good considering that it's served on a relatively small boat for 150 people. Upon arrival, we spent a few minute walking around the fort which is impressive in size. Climbing up to the top offers an amazing view of the azure, turquoise, and navy blue water. We then walked the moat. If you are not up for snorkeling (and you should be) this offers an opportunity to see some of the tropical fish. We were able to see yellow tail snapper and a barracuda from the walls of the moat. After lunch, we went snorkeling from the north beach. The waters were calm, and the visibility were decent, and we were able to see lots of yellow tail snapper, sea urchin, conch, a beautiful blue and yellow fish, and, on my way in, a 4 foot barracuda that swam right under me. This is relatively easy snorkeling from the shore, so a great opportunity to try it for the first time (much easier than some of my prior experiences where you jump off a boat). On the boat ride back, drinks are served (for a charge). It was a lovely day, and something I would do again, probably devoting a little more time for snorkeling.

His insight into the Fort Jefferson history on the NP site was what made the tour so good. Taking this trip was a bucket list item for my wife and I and we were blown away at the beauty of the surrounding area. Even though this NP is out of the way, you have to take this trip.

It was an early morning, but it was smooth on the way out to the island (about 2.5 hours). We had a nice breakfast on the boat, got to go out on the front deck to enjoy the views, and then arrived at the park and the REAL fun excitement began! We got off the boat, took a walk around the moat (about a half mile) and then went back to the boat for a bit of lunch (saved the rest for later) and then got snorkel gear and headed to the south beach to get in the slightly chilly waters! We snorkeled all the way around the outer wall of the Fort, saw lots of coral & fish & other things I'm not familiar with, and then got out and shared our stories of the adventure while we enjoyed a nice short walk along the moat again, back to the other beach where we got in. The weather was GORGEOUS, the history of Fort Jefferson is unique & interesting, and the views are unlike any I've ever seen! Truly one of, if not the most remote & gorgeous National Parks our country can boast! Highly recommend this trip if you're in Key West for at least a couple nights!

On Friday, because of high winds, the boat and its 165 day trippers, as well as the seaplanes, did not venture out tot he Dry Tortugas for only the second or third time in many years and we had the Key to ourselves that entire day.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"During our second trip to Key West, we decided to take this day trip since we had more time on our hands to go.This is an all day trip. Getting back around dinner time.The ferry ride was very comfortable....loved the breeze and sunny ocean skies...there was breakfast like bagels served on board but we grabbed food from Cuban Coffee Queen near the ferry dock before we left. You may also wish to grab items from there thinking of lunch also.Even though the ferry serves lunch while at the island, it was just sandwiches and drinks that you may not care for.Took the tour first then returned to the ferry dock to sign out our snorkeling equipment included in the ferry cost.Enjoyed being in the waters...fyi, is a resident croc on the island but has never bothered a soul in all these years but visitors did have sightings of him. So please proceed with caution.Great beaches and sand, so if you don't feel comfortable in the water you can still enjoy the shore...not many shady areas so prepare for that.Ran out of time to visit the little museum inside the fort but that is a nice shady and air conditioned little side stop to go into.The ride back to Key West was rougher and some were sea sick so ensure that you have meds or are prepared for that. Large washrooms to change on.Otherwise, enjoy a drink from the bar on the way back!Great day!","January 17, 2017",WONDERFUL OUTING AWAY FROM KEY WEST,91,"London, Canada",4

Leave at 7:30 am and get back at 5:30 pm. Trip is 2.5 hrs each way. O eve you are ther, you can do a self guided tour of Fort Jefferson, borrow snorkel gear and spend time on a beautiful beach (a rare find in Key West!)Would have been nice to spend a little more time on the beach (we had to be back on board the ferry at 2:30 pm).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"You have to go by ferry or seaplane unless you have your own boat. The park lies about 70 miles west of Key West and sits at the end of the keys. However, it is well worth the effort of getting out there as the shades of blue and green of the water surrounding the fort is spectacular.The ferry takes quite a bit longer coming and going than the seaplane, but the seaplane is a lot more expensive. We used the plane and it was worth every penny for our group. Either way will get you out there and that is the important thing.The fort is huge and you are free to explore pretty much all of the three levels. There is a small visitors center with a few trinkets for sale, but no food or drinks, that comes and goes with you. You can snorkel or swim or wander about, just leave any shells you find behind as this is a national park.","January 15, 2017","Hard to get to, but worth the effort",128,Chapel Hill,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,Don't believe the water is warm just cause it's south Florida. Jump in and just get used to it. The boat ride was enjoyable despite and comfortable enough. It's nice to walk around on and enjoy all views. They provide breakfast and lunch which is more than sufficient for nourishing the body for a day At the beach. Beautiful beautiful beautiful water and sand. The fort is stunning with history and views. Even if you aren't a history buff it's great. Snorkeling was fun but not the best. The water is cloudy. Don't expect lots to see Dory or Nemo but the fish and corral are plentiful and amazing. I was definitely disappointed they pushed for Tips at the end of the trip. I would assume they are federal employees paid decent wages. They were great - definitely. Price - high and not exactly worth the trip but to go there you have no other option. I am not disappointed but would give a 2nd thought. ,"January 13, 2017",Fun but pricey ,25,cleveland,3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom ferry out to the island for the day. It is very efficiently done. They serve a continental breakfast and a cold lunch on the boat. They also offer either a twenty minute or 75 minute tour/talk once you get there. We just did the 20 min talk and Libby did a great job. They also have an app and some paper information regarding the island that you get when you sign in and that was very good. My husband and I rented wet suits (because the water was chilly that day) at the place right by the boat pier. They were very nice there and the price was very reasonable. They also have 'perscription' googles that you can rent if you need corrective lenses. There wasn't much to see when we snorkeled because the water that day was murky but a ray did pass right by us!There is a beautiful serenity about this place dispite the history of it. It is a place to relax and unwind. You can even take your lunch off the boat and eat at one of the picnic benches or bring a picnic blanket. The breakfast and lunch (which includes soda and chips) are free. Take a couple of extras because in the afternoon ride home, they charge for those same chips and sodas. Coffee and tea are complientary all day. The trip is 2 1/2 hours each way and you have about 4 hours to spend on the island. If you don't swim or snorkel, there really isn't 4 hours of stuff to do there. We took about 2 hours (including the 20 min talk) to explore and used the rest of the time to snorkel. There are also outdoor showers on the boat to help get the sand off of you. We wore our bathing suits and cover-ups onto the boat and that worked out well. On the day we went, the sea was very choppy and I would highly recommend that you take bonine or dramamine. ","January 13, 2017",Beautiful Place,81,Fishkill,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"No day trip can do justice to this pristine and historic locale. Although the gear and logistics may seem overwhelming, it is worth the time and effort. We recently stayed for the three night maximum, and would have gladly stayed longer. Yes, the toilets smell and some conveniences of home are obviously lacking, but the opportunity to experience this National TREASURE are worth the effort. Rent kayaks from Marty to enhance your experience. He's quirky, but gets the job done. The night sky and hours on a disconnected island before and after the day-trippers are priceless. I won't bore you with details covered by previous campers. However, if you are a minimalist and want to pack light, as in no charcoal or heavy coolers, invest in a BIOLITE CAMPSTOVE. I don't work for the company, but can't recommend it enough. We were the envy of other campers for the ease in which we boiled water, using only twigs and debris. I did bring a few bags of their pellets as well. Starbucks Vias and dehydrated backpacking meals were the way to go for us. We supplemented with fresh fruit off the ferry at lunch. Packed some cheese, adult beverages, salami, and chocolate in our small YETI. Did have to endure some fierce winds. And contrary to popular belief, we camped in the exposed overflow area and wouldn't change a thing. Lots of room to spread out and see the stars at night.

The shoals are a navigation hazard and a lighthouse was built, then the sheltered anchorage was deemed at risk from other warships so the fort was built to protect it however new technology in the form of rifled cannon barrels made the structure obsolete. Traveled by seaplane and had the island to ourselves - some dozen folks - for a couple of hours which was really enjoyable.

They sail every day of the year. Included in the fare was a fresh breakfast and lunch. On the return trip, beer and wine was sold with snacks available. But the real star was the Fort Jefferson and the clear turquoise waters. An amazing feat of engineering. The guide (""Hollywood"") was enthusiastic and totally knowledgeable. Sadly, we arrived at the beginning of a thunderstorm and were not able to use the snorkel gear that was included. But that almost made it special. Do read before you go!

There are limited signage and displays describing the place. There are some interesting displays inside the fort adjacent to the gift store. Beyond the fort, the swimming is pretty neat and snorkeling can be good on a calm sea day. Walking the uneven beaches are very scenic, full of items washed up on the beach (treasures) and very underutilized. You can pretty much be by yourself after about 10 minutes of walking.

The trip by boat took an hour and a half by the catamaran ( Big Cat) Yankee Freedom was out of commission during our visit. Big Cat was large and comfortable. Our day included breakfast, lunch and mask, fin and snorkle should you want to snorkle or you could swim or sunbathe. The crew on board were helpful and attentive.

As we walked the perimeter moat, we saw beautiful tropical fish in the clear waters. The fort itself seems to be slowly being restored (crews were on site reworking exterior bricks). We would highly recommend more effort by the NPS to provide historical markers even, provide a film, something more than the few signs in place to discuss the historical significance -- info we found most helpful was actually on the NPS/Dry Tortugas web site so it is already available--just needs to be displayed on site.","January 8, 2017",Terrific day trip experience!,11,"Baltimore, Maryland",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We made reservations a month in advance on the Yankee Freedom out of Key West. The weather cooperated as our scheduled day was perfect with sun and light winds. If you are prone to seasickness, try to avoid windy days as the sea can get kind of rough. Both breakfast and lunch are provided on the big air conditioned CAT. We toured Fort Jefferson upon arriving without the guide from the boat. We ate lunch and then snorkels for 2 hours before the boat's departure at 3 pm. Our only regret was that the time on the Island was too short. If you are physically and mentally able to camp on the island, it would be great to spend at least one night on the island after most people have left on th boat. Lot of seabirds, including gulls, ducks, pelicans etc. Tons of schooling fish right at the docks including grouper and baracudas. Swimming round the outside of the moat wall is the best place to see the tropical fish close to shore. Overall it is a great day outing that takes about 11.hours of the day.

The waters are full of life and are crystal clear. I am not a camper but once i got on this island I decided that the next time I will be camping. Yes the price tag is a bit higher but when you start list all the activities it is relatively cheap. You get breakfast, lunch, a tour on the boat and off the boat, transportation, National Park entry, and snorkeling gear. Now if you have your own snorkeling gear it is definitely worth bringing your own, theirs is understandably far from even mediocre quality, one of our friend's lenses fell right out while he was snorkeling.","January 7, 2017",WOW!!!,3,"Tallahassee, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We purchased tickets to Yankee Freedom III online in advance (about 8 days before). This wonderful trip will satisfy anybody's interests: snorkeling and birds watching for nature lovers, gorgeous views for photographers, guided tour around the fort for history interests, not too much walking (island is small) for older participants. I probably would highly recommend it to everybody, except families with small children. There are no guard rails on the fort walls and you really need to have basic swimming skills to enjoy snorkeling. The boat ride is very enjoyable. Food on board is fresh, but nothing special - standard American continental breakfast and lunch. However, coffee is available all day. Alcoholic drinks and snacks served for extra charge on the way back (it helps after a full day of fun activities). Special thank you to our tour guide Hollywood. It's not that often when I meet a person who loves his job so much, and ready to talk about it none-stop for the whole day! He was very knowledgeable about the civil war, American history, the history of the Fort Jefferson, the Florida Keys, etc. While my husband and son went snorkeling, I joined Fort Jefferson history tour with Hollywood and had a blast!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We went to the park by ferry and we spent the entire day on the tour. The whole round-trip takes 5 h sailing in the open sea and you have 6 hours in the island. If you prefer, there's also a seaplane that follows the itinerary from Key West. We bought a tour package on the official website (drytortugas dot com) a week earlier that included the ferry, some snacks and tickets for the national park.The tour guide kept telling everybody to administer a dramamine before to avoid motion sickness, however, in my mind, the boat was pretty steady and there wasn't such bouncing due to the waves. Also its facilities and seats were comfortable. The breakfast was enough: there was cheese, bread, coffee and fruits like watermelon and pineapples. I think there could have been more options at lunch, however. Actually, the lunch looked more like another breakfast for me.The Fort Jefferson is amazing, there are many outstanding views when you get to the top of the building, but be careful, mind where you're walking because there's no protection fence. It's pretty well preserved and, by the time of our visit, they were restoring or building something inside the fort and near the beach. Overall, I think we had a very short time to explore and visit everything. Moreover, the fort is a four-story building and a pretty large structure that even with a couple of hours, we barely got to know it at all. Therefore, we decided to spend more time swimming and snorkeling, if you want to get to know everything your best option is to camp on the island.Some people go there for camping and I could tell the camping site seemed pretty cozy. When I read about it on the official website I deemed how we could manage to camp there an overnight, but, due to our lack of experience on camping we gave up to stay an overnight. However, I'm certainly this is a must-do activity on Dry Tortugas, but be aware that they demand earlier schedule if you're planning to camp on the island.We did snorkeling over there, and though the water wasn't as clear as I imagined, I believe that in the summer the water gets clearer. We could see many beautiful marine life animals and birds, and, actually, there was a signpost warning that you may find dangerous animals like sharks, therefore you should swim at your own risk. I could see plenty of little fish, and sometimes they were so many that I couldn't see the bottom of the sea, and I still have no clue of how deep was it. By the way, you don't need to go far to reach a place where you can't touch or see the bottom of the sea; right in front of the sidewalk of the fort is pretty deep. There are no strong waves near the beach as there seem to be some reefs ahead of the island, which stops the strongest ones.Getting back to the boat, I could notice that there are some open air showers on the ferry, which is pretty useful to get rid of the sand on one's body.The tour was really magical and I intend to go back there for camping!","January 6, 2017",Outstanding nature and charming Fort Jefferson,57,"Brasilia, DF",5

We had always wanted to visit Dry Tortugas National Park, but it was booked on our two previous trips. This time we made reservations before we arrived.

We were very pleasantly surprised by the continental-type breakfast options.When we arrived at Dry Tortugas we were free to spend the 4.5 hours as we wished. Most of our group opted to snorkel and then checked out Jefferson Fort. It really is a neat place to explore and the views from the ""windows"" of the fort are pretty amazing.There is a two hour window when guests may return to the ferry for lunch to be enjoyed on the boat or in the park. Again, we were pleased with the lunch options, and the crew was very helpful and friendly. There is a place to change clothes in the park, and showers available on the boat.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My son came to visit me and he wanted to do more than hang out with me at home, so he suggested the Dry Tortugas National Park. Neither of us had been, so we went. We took the Yankee Freedom from Key West. This is a bit pricey, but my son wanted to treat me. The itinerary is: Check in time: 7:00 am (campers 6:30am) Boarding time: 7:30 amDeparture time: 8:00 amArrive at Fort Jefferson: 10:15 am*Fort Jefferson Tour: 11:00 amLunch: 11:00 am – 1:00 pmDepart: 3:00 pmArrive in Key West: 5:15 pm* * Times may differ a bit depending on weather.The Dry Tortugas are about 70 miles from Key West, so you can imagine the boat goes very fast! It is a beautiful ride, with all sorts of sea life appearing next to and in the wake of the boat. There is shelter inside, along with restrooms and a galley that serves breakfast and lunch. You can take the tour of the fort or explore it on your own. Also, they offer snorkels, flippers and buoyancy control vests at no charge so you can explore the clear waters around the fort. I turned down the flippers, but wished I hadn't, because there is a lot of washed up coral pieces in the water that are rough on your feet. I saw a bunch of beautifully colored fish and a sea horse and sea plants. It was beautiful. We went in July, so it was crazy hot, so the snorkeling was quite welcomed. There was an abundance of bird life to see out there, too, even though it was summer. I am told there are a lot more birds there in the winter, but it was really beautiful.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Lots of history, and interesting factoids about early America and what led to the building of this fort. They could hit you with a 400lb. cannon ball from three miles out! We did the fort tour, and self explored around the facility, then snorkeled in beautiful blue water for 2 hrs. Not as much to see around the island, but still worth the all day trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We enjoyed this experience. You do have a catamaran boat ride of 2 1/2 hours each way, but we felt it was worth it. We brought cards and kept the kids busy. The water had a small craft advisory the day we went, so it was 5-8 foot swells. Always travel with motion sickness tablets, and watch the marine forecast. We faired well, but many didn't on the return ride. The crew was mostly friendly, one gal on the crew seemed put out at times, but we chose not to let her spoil our outing. The food is included for breakfast and lunch. Nothing fancy but good eats. Snorkel gear included, but if you have your own mask, you might as well bring it. We heard they have a large saltwater croc that has been there for 10 years now! We didn't see it and I think I'm okay with that;) Snorkeling that day was okay, limited visibility with the small craft advisory, but we completely loved the fort and the tour they provided, although the guide was a bit short with his responses when people asked him a question... ""I'm not going to answer that, I will cover it later""... It became a laughing point to some of us, each time he did that and it was many times... Otherwise, good info shared:) You do have to book through the vendor that runs the boat, Yankee Freedom, even though it's a National Park. You can camp, too, if you plan ahead. And even seaplanes come and go daily, for a fee:) The fortress is massive and the stories are colorful.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is an all day trip. Be sure to take sunblock, swimwear, change of clothes and anything you might need for the day. The 2+ hour boat ride there can be a little chilly so take a long-sleeve shirt or jacket to wear so you can enjoy the view outside. The boat is a little loud so I listened to music on the way. The food served for breakfast and lunch was surprisingly good with healthy options and much-needed coffee. You sign up on the boat to use the snorkel gear once you arrive so be sure to do this if you don't bring your own. Best snorkeling is down from the beach near the poles pelicans and birds sit on. We did the long (hour+) history tour, but opted to go swim and enjoy the sun after a half hour of getting background information on the island and fort. The ship crew is accommodating and things ran smoothly during our visit. I purchased tickets online in advance. There was a discount if you bought them online 7+ days in advance, but we waited to see the best day based on weather closer to time. I'm glad we waited because the crew said it was the best day of weather there in a while. There is a small gift shop in the fort to buy souvenirs and multiple national park stamps if you have a passport book. It's not cheap, but I was very happy to get to go see Dry Tortugas and the boat ride was nice. I asked some campers staying on the island what they thought and a woman said she was leery, but it turned out to be really nice. The couple had a telescope so I asked about stargazing and they said after 1 a.m. it's pretty good. ","December 31, 2016",Fun in the sun and history,42,"Memphis, Tennessee",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I took the Yankee Freedom out there as the day trip gave me the most time out there and it was a blast. You leave early, but they give you a continental breakfast on board (I'm a vegetarian and they had yogurt, fruit, breads, and other things I could eat). I waited until the first rush of people got fed before venturing down to the line (I was sitting on the deck and the breakfast is in the cabin below) and the line wasn't bad then. Be prepared for a long trip on a boat. It is a large boat, so there is plenty of space to move around, but if you have kids, they may get antsy. We left at 7:40 and reached the park at 10:00 and we saw dolphins, turtles, and sharks on the way out. There are three levels: the lower cabin (and most of the bathrooms/heads), the middle deck with a small cabin, and the upper deck with no seating, but a ton of wind and gorgeous views. The upper deck is worth a short visit even if you don't stay long. On the trip out you can sign up for guided tours of Fort Jefferson, which are quite interesting, or you can go around by yourself and learn from the plaques how this Civil War Era fort was part of a coastal defense network for the US in the 19th century, but really never saw combat. It was used as a prison during and after the US Civil War (with horrible conditions). They also show you how they obtained fresh water in the middle of the ocean, which is interesting. A small portion is currently under construction, but since it is one of the largest brick constructions in the Western Hemisphere, there is plenty still to explore even without the construction zone. While the boat has concessions (including lunch on the boat from 11:00 to 1:00) and bathrooms, the island does not. You will also have to bring all your garbage back to the boat. After the fort, the South beach is the best, though you should walk all around the fort on the sea wall where you can walk between the reef and the moat. I didn't snorkel there, but there are some pilings that look like they would be interesting to explore. There is also a sand bar that reaches out to Bush Key (Long Key out of bounds because it is a bird sanctuary) which is beautiful to walk around on the beach. There are dead driftwood logs and trees that people have decorated with conch shells. The North beach is much smaller and the water has more seaweed. The South beach is nicer with crystal clear blue water and you get to swim with schools of fish that are trying to avoid the pelicans, who will dive in the water to get fish ten feet away from you in the water. Definitely bring your beach gear, sunscreen, and something to change into after for the trip back. The bar on the boat opens at 2 pm and you depart at 2:45 pm. Breakfast and lunch are provided on the ship, but I would pack anything else you may need for snacks unless you want to rely on expensive concessions on the boat. I had two towels, one for laying on the beach, and one for drying off, and that was very convenient. Pack a big plastic bag to bring all the wet and sandy towels and clothes back in. As much as you try to get all the sand off, I still had some on me afterward. The ride back gets you back to Key West at around 5 pm. 4.5 hours to explore this gorgeous key and the historic fort/prison was enough, though an extra hour would have been nice. You spend about 5 hours on the boat with the trip out and back, so be prepared, even though many kids seemed to fall asleep on the way back. On the whole, an awesome day and well worth it.","December 31, 2016",Full day of a gorgeous key and interesting fort/prison!,29,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I had an incredible day at the Dry Tortugas. We enjoyed the ferry ride which provided two full, well appointed meals and friendly, knowledgeable staff. We were glad we chose to go without our four year old as we had more time to snorkel and explore without having to worry about his safety.Our day trip was the highlight of our trip, and I would love the opportunity to go back again!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The beach to the left of where the boat dropped us off at was great for families and there seemed to be great snorkeling but was unable to take part. The fort was great to explore, but with small children be careful on the top where this is no railing and the second story of the fort does not block off openings that a small kid could walk into. The 20 minute talk was a good overview over the fort and with a small kid it was good and quick. The area to the right is not as good beach wise but still pretty. The water around the fort is clear and you can really see the aquatic life just by looking down. It was a worthwhile trip.","December 30, 2016",Fun day at a National Park,42,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Very interesting and a one of a kind experience. We flew to the Fort in a seaplane, which was an adventure in itself, but the Fort was fascinating and a wealth of historical facts. Currently they have about 15 masons restoring the Fort ....and they're even making their own bricks on site. The guided tours provide all you need to know about this historical building. A must see.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"An early start for our day trip out to Dry Tortugas. We decided on the ferry ride out on the Yankee Freedom III, it is longer but you get more time at the Fort. You check in around 7-7.30am they board you pretty quickly. You have breakfast on board while you listen to info, put your name down for snorkelling etc, its a 2 and bit hour ride out but the time seems to go by quickly. What an amazing place! I can't believe they managed to build it out there!! We listened to the short talk on the fort, then grabbed some lunch, snorkel gear and found a spot on the beach. There is also a longer guided tour of the Fort. The snorkelling is good, especially along the fort walls and out towards the dock ruins. You can change out of your beach gear in the huts there before boarding your boat for the return, you depart around 2.45pm and arrive back in Key West at around 5pm. This was our first boat trip out from Key West and we very much enjoyed it, the Fort is truly spectacular. However, one thing to consider, you are with a lot of people on this trip, it can feel crowded on the boat although there is a seat for everyone, but you can find your own space at Dry Tortugas. From Key West you can go for alternate day trips - smaller boats, smaller crowds, better food and a more personal service for a better price - but you don't get the fantastic Fort Jefferson.","December 29, 2016",A great day trip!,26,"Leeds, United Kingdom",4

The fort itself is very impressive, 16 million bricks and the largest brick structure in the Western Hemisphere. Was very choppy the day we were there so the snorkeling wasn't the best but enjoyed relaxing on the beach in an extremely remote place.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I got there by the Seaplane charter which is fine, but I think you need more than 2.5hrs to snorkel and tour the Ft. That said I got there early in the day, and in December so the heat and sun wasn't bad. If you don't like historical ruins you might get board with more than 3 hrs. If you are a good scuba diver, the snorkeling will likely be boring.I could have used about 4 hours to take it all in wet/dry.Now I have heard from others that spending most of the day in the sun and then getting on the Ferry back to Key West can make the ride back a LOOOOONG Ride after cooking in the sun and being hungry and dehydrated.","December 28, 2016",How you get there???,7,"Lafayette, Indiana",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Excellent trip. Took the Yankee Freedom. The ride out was not bad, but coming back was a bit bumpy. If you're prone to sea sickness, I'd recommend taking something. 2.5 hour too and from the Fort. They provide a lite/continental breakfast and lunch on board. 11-1pm is lunch. Once there you have the option to take a tour. One was 30 min and other was 75 min. We chose the 75 min. Our tour guide was great and very informative. I'd recommend eating lunch prior to the tour since you won't have much time, if any, to eat after the tour. They clear the food At 1pm. You can snorkel, go to the beach, walk around the fort. No cell phone service either for pretty much the entire day. Make sure to book way in advance. Would definitely recommend this trip, just be prepared for the long boat ride.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"First: Taking the Ferry? Take the dramamine. It's $1 well spent, ESPECIALLY if you have kids. (I won't go into any more detail that that). Also bring lots of sun protection. I've been to old forts up and down the east coast, and nothing prepared me for how massive the structure is. It was also nice, since I've been to Ford's Theater in DC, and lived near the Mudd home in Harford County MD, to visit one of the last places associated with the Lincoln assassination. We spent 2+ hours meandering around the moat wall, and the various levels inside the fort. Had the weather been nicer, we would definitely availed ourselves of the snorkeling gear available to use since we took the Yankee Freedom ferry. I had expected to see much more wildlife (and esp birds) than we did. Perhaps it was the overcast, windy conditions, but otherwise it was a fascinating visit.

We arrived and had the island to ourselves until a ferry arrived just after 10:00 AM. I'd suggest comfortable walking shoes. Bring a good camera and brush up on how to take photos when you're in a dark place (like an old fort) and you want to get the beautiful water. I'm not as much of a camper as my sister, so she was much more receptive to that idea than I was. Some of the people that had camped mentioned it was good to mentally and physically prepare for that level of isolation.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Rating this as average as it compares to the other National Parks in the US. Places like Crater Lake, Arches, Grand Canyon, etc. are more impressive. That said, if you like the idea of finding those remote locations, it's hard to beat this speck of land in the middle of the Gulf.The fort itself is cool, but nothing overly amazing structurally. It's more impressive in terms of the fact this thing was built so far from the mainland. Snorkeling is average. There is plenty of better snorkeling much closer to Key West. Kids enjoyed the swimming to help keep cool.We did the day trip so you are only there for a few hours, which is more than sufficient. The total trip time from Key West consumes a full day.Overnighters are sure to get a brilliant display of the night sky as well as sunset and sunrise as there is ocean 360 degrees around.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I go to Key West about once a year because I like the place and it is a quick and easy nonstop flight from where I live, leaving at the civilized hour of 11:45 a.m. and getting me there by about 2:30 p.m. The one thing missing is that, since I don't fish and don't much like group boat tours, I'm right there on the water but never get out on it. So, this time I booked one of Key West Sea Plane Charters flights to the unspoiled Dry Tortugas with its famous old fort and magnificent beaches.The flight is about 30-35 minutes and the company's promotional material says the low-flying plane lets you see sea life along the way, and once at the Tortugas, offers great snorkeling. In my case, the winds had apparently been blowing for a few days before my trip, so the water wasn't clear enough to take full advantage of that.But it was a great trip anyway. There's one really long unspoiled curve of white sand beach and, unlike on some Carribean islands, totally unspoiled -- not even a sign of man-made sea junk washed up anywhere. I didn't have too much interest in the fort and spent my time walking around, snorkeling or swimming.The charter company runs to 4-hour sea plane trips, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and an all day one. it obviously is a much quicker way to get to the Tortugas than the ferry (although the ferry is just as obviously much cheaper). Keep in mind that when the trip is described as a four hour one, that includes the flight times back and forth, so the actual stay on the island is shorter.The seaplanes hold 10 people, so it's pretty important to reserve.","December 23, 2016","Pricey by seaplane, but a great side trip from Key West",42,"Washington, DC",5

Walk around the fort's top walls and honeycombed interiors - fascinating sense of how it must have been hundreds of years ago.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Two mainstream options to access. Either by seaplane our by ferry. I've taken a 3 hour ferry before and it was not very enjoyable, we opted for the seaplane. Very glad we did. The 8am flight gives you private island time before the ferry of over 100 people arrive. Plus you don't waste half of a day. We also saw all the keys and islands, ship wrecks, and marine life by taking the seaplane. It was spectacular. There are NO facilities on the island of Fort Jefferson. You bring your own water and snacks. Try to be mindful of limiting your footprint by bringing minimal needs and leaving nothing behind. Take your trash back with you. There are portable toilets on site but nothing else. No cell service here and it's refreshing not to have it. There are beaches you can enjoy in tranquility. The surf and current are strong so snorkeling is not amazing but it's funny to see all the small fish surround you in the water. We wanted to camp but it wasn't in our schedule. Watch the weather before booking to camp. You're truly alone except for rangers. Expect to leave salty and sandy all over. Take minimal needs as if you are going to the beach with no storage area. The Fort is small enough to fully walk in a short time. You can even walk the breaker wall on the outside of the fort. Bring a good camera. The real life colors are spectacular and you may never be back again. Make sure to tip your captain or pilot for the extra attention and tour to and from the island. Expect to enjoy this place in your own way while respecting others space and thier desire to have thier own personal experience. Trip advisor has information to the transportation services.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Well worth visiting this little piece of paradise, 70 miles from Key West. Snorkeling around the moat wall of Fort Jefferson is one of several highlights.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Excellent view into key history of the military in the keys. Suggest being mobile to take in this site. Great audio walking tour. Wonderful snorkeling.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you like to combine history with beauty this is the trip for you. The only negative is the ferry ride is 2.5 hours. However the boat, the Yankee Freedom III, along with the crew makes it pass quickly. Our guide, ""Hollywood"" was full of energy and made the entire day enjoyable. The rest of the crew is friendly and willing to make your trip enjoyable. You leave the dock around 8 AM and arrive around 10:30 AM. The boat heads back to Key West at 3 PM. They served us a continental breakfast en route and while we were docked at the key they served sandwiches on board. Both meals were good, but don't expect fine dinning. The boat has a full bar but it does not open until 2 PM. Fort Jefferson is very cool, you can take in a 20 minute talk about the fort or you can do a 75 minute guided walking tour. We did the 20 min talk which we felt was just right. You can explore the entire Key and your are provided with snorkel gear. The snorkeling was OK, we saw some cool fish and coral but the water is not as clear as some other Caribbean snorkels we have taken. Still it is worthwhile to do. The Beauty of Bush Key, next to the fort is stunning. Nice to take a walk on the beach there. It's a full day buy definitely worth the time","December 4, 2016",Wow,45,"Dartmouth, Massachusetts",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wife and I took an excursion to Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas, 70 miles west of Key West, during our first trip to the Keys in December 2016.I would venture that most people who do this go for the snorkeling and camping. Along with six other patrons, we were the exception. There are two ways to get here, seaplane or the commercial venture Yankee Freedom III. We opted for the latter.It was off-season and the boat was about 2/3-full. The seas were smooth that day, after reportedly having been quite choppy the previous two weeks. I appreciated that seeing as how I am pretty much a ""landlubber"". It did get a little ""rolly"" on the way back and I got a little urpy. But it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. That was a plus since they serve a small breakfast buffet on the way out and lunch while berthed at the fort. I was able to keep both down! The bar opens at 2 pm for those so inclined. Our tour guide was an energetic fellow named Jeff (his ""stage name"" was Hollywood). He gave us good preparatory information on the way out and was a super guide during the 75-minute tour of the fort. Wife is not a big history buff but even she came away positively impressed.With this box checked, next time we visit we will plan to snorkle and camp a few nights. There's lots of wildlife in the water and when conditions are right, you can see it from the moat encircling the fort. Wife saw the resident crocodile!","December 4, 2016",Wonderful history lesson at Fort Jefferson,319,"Juneau, Alaska",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Fort Jefferson is a very interesting historic site/ruins as it is well weathered by time. The island is dry as a bone with no natural water other than rainfall. Summertime? Invest in lots of hydration, I live ~200 miles north of DTNP and the difference in UV intensity is noticeable. Invest in a white rash guard with good UV protection if your staying more than a day., and for the day is you burn easily. Campsites are first come first served and limited. The park rangers were very helpful in finding the best sites. The overflow sites are remarkably exposed to all the elements, check with the Park Service or the Yankee Freedom for availability before you book. The other sites are either ocean access or wooded. Like all parks should be, you pack it in you pack it out. While this is a sand island I strongly suggest sleeping pads the ground is unforgiving. Other than that the Park Service takes great care of the site so the camping was enjoyable. The fort has a unique history and it dominates the island, tours are available. I was focused on the snorkeling and the moat wall provided an interesting mix of corals and sea creatures. There are some coral heads off shore, however the ocean was a bit choppy so I stuck to the area around the wall. All in all I found this trip enjoyable ","December 2, 2016",Very unique historic site,3,"Boca Raton, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Spending Thanksgiving on Dry Tortugas was not the best idea, but this tour was great! They gave you breakfast and lunch as part of the package, which was very good and you also got the use of snorkeling gear to check out the reefs around the island. It was the perfect amount of time for the activities available. The weather this time of year was perfect....but I am not sure any other time would be as good!","November 30, 2016",best thanksgiving ever!,15,"Sayreville, New Jersey, United States",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Your trip to the National park will take all day. Make sure you book your tour well in advance. It is a popular tour and usually filled to capacity at ( 150 persons). The trip is 2 1/2 hours in each direction. The ferry departs at 8 am. Breakfast is served until only 830 but surprisingly that did give everyone plenty of time to grab something to eat. The ferry arrives at the Dry Tortugas at 1030 and leaves again at 3 pm with all expected on board by 245 pm. The fortress is an amazing accomplishment. We opted to explore the fortress on our own. The upper levels of the fortress are at your own risk since there are no railings or other safety structures. Based on this factor and the length of the ferry ride I would find this adventure unsuitable for very young children. Lunch was available from 11-1 on board. Lunch consisted of sandwich fixings, fruit, chips, cookies and drinks - a picnic. Snorkel equipment was provided. Make sure your equipment fits. My husband was disappointed with a leaky poor fitting mask. There are two snorkel beaches. We tried the North beach first. I would not waste my time there but head right to the South beach. At the south beach the snorkeling was best on the left side toward the old pier pilings. While the water is an incredible blue, the snorkeling wasn't as great as some other locations we have been to. The Dry Tortugas is also home to a lot of birds. It was the wrong time of year for bird activity but we did see some magnificent frigate birds. Of course during nesting seasons some parts of the key are off limits. Then it was a long 2 1/2 hour ride back. The bar was open and the crew made a great pina colada. In winter your return to Key West will coincide with sunset. If I were ever to return I would want to invest in the expense of a seaplane trip. I would also want to consider camping overnight. It must be incredible being out there far from civilization with the night sky.","November 29, 2016",A full day's adventure,118,LAKELAND FL,5

The boat rocks, and I don't mean party rocks. Trip always includes a tour at the fort, and the structure is still standing, so one gets the feel of the loneliness the typhoid fever hospital there was. Bird sanctuary too.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was our second time visiting to the park and this time we camped overnight. The park rangers were all great, very helpful and clearly proud of their park. Once the day visitors we back on the boat, the island became very quiet and peaceful. The fort is easy to self tour with descriptive signs in appropriate places to tell the history of the park. There are two beaches for swimming and snorkeling. There are no safety rails installed to protect you from yourself so be careful and use good judgement when in the fort. Park improvement projects were underway when we were visiting the fort but didn't get in the way of having a good time at the park. The fort is huge, old and out in the middle of the ocean so maintenance is to be expected, I guess. We definitely would visit the park again sometime soon.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Basically an all day trip. Ferry takes you there, 2 hour ride to and from the Dry Tortugas National Park. Ferry provides breakfast, lunch and a few souvenirs. Helpful tip: buy and take Dramamine to help with the boat rocking (it’s not fun being sick on a boat).They also provide snorkeling equipment, but we didn’t want to use them since we wear glasses and were feeling a bit ill from the ride there. On the boat they played country music the whole time on the speakers, so if you don’t like country, bring your own music to listen to or earplugs. Ha The boat had three areas to sit, main level where they serve food, an open air upstairs area and an enclosed upstairs area which was AC’ed.The Fort itself was cool and big. We took the guided tour and stopped at the fort’s gift shop and walked around the moat of the fort. We got some pretty cool pictures from this trip.","November 22, 2016",long ferry ride worth the trip!,5,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited here last week while on vacation in Key West. The location itself is absolutely beautiful, and the fort is really fascinating.What I didn't really like was the lack of information/warnings about the ferry ride. It's over two hours and was surprisingly rough. There were passengers getting sick/throwing up all over, particularly on the way home. We are boaters and even I was surprised at the roughness of the ferry ride. Just remember, you are traveling through the ocean, and it can get very rough. TAKE THE DRAMAMINE. IT'S ONLY A DOLLAR!The breakfast they provided was fine, and the lunch was very good. Also, the snorkeling was not great, but it was a windy day, and there's no control over that. Keep in mind, you are out there completely on your own. No lifeguard, no supervision while you're out there in the open water. You have to sign a release to be able to do that. There was a little anxiety there. This is not their fault, and they are very clear about that. I just don't think I realized the gravity of it before we were actually out there.All in all, it was a good day. Not sure we would do it again, but maybe my opinion would be different if we would have had better weather.","November 21, 2016","Fascinating place, long ferry ride",5,"Toledo, Ohio",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Really enjoyed out trip to dry tortugas and Ft. Jefferson. The trip to the Ft takes around 2 1/2 hours. Unfortunately, it was an overcast windy day. A good suggestion would be to take Dramamine if you have any issues with motion sickness. It would be nice to have more time there. The fort is large and you can either do a self guided tour (which is suggested or take a guided tour, the guided tour takes longer) The snorkeling was really nice. There just wasn't enough time to really snorkel and absorb the experience with the fort. I wouldn't do this trip again late in November as it was cool and windy and overcast. It really puts a damper on the colors of the water. We had sun for maybe 30 minutes. It is a really beautiful place.","November 20, 2016",Historical and great snorkel trip,13,"Houston, Texas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,Visited the Fort through the Yankee Freedom Ferry. The Fort is well maintained and extremely remote. I found the Park Rangers somewhat elusive other than a few tours they give. The workers on the Ferry also give some tours. Rangers seemed to be to busy sitting in their office. Also the visitor center was very disappointing. The Fort itself is an excellent historic site and is being maintained very well. ,"November 17, 2016",Excellent Historical Fort in a remote setting,70,Texas,4

The masonry fort is a tremendous construction feat. The surrounding water is every shade of blue and breathtaking. The snorkeling is superb with amazing water clarity. The ferry company (YANKEE FREEDOM) was very good, breakfast and lunch were first rate. Hated to leave.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were visiting Key West for a milestone anniversary so I was considering taking the seaplane to Dry Tortugas. Then when I realized the ferry was not going to be operating during the time we were there it made the decision quite easy. The flight to and from Dry Tortugas went very quickly and we thoroughly enjoyed the views from the seaplane. While on Garden Key we toured the fort, snorkeled off the beach and walked along the moat wall. It was breathtakingly beautiful and touring Fort Jefferson was fascinating. Since the ferry was not operating during our visit we practically had the place to ourselves. Yes, it was quite expensive but I honestly feel it was worth every penny for this once in a lifetime experience.","November 17, 2016",Worth the Money!,2,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Where do I start on this? We love going out to Ft. Jefferson but there is so much to see and do, that we usually go the camping route. I am going to do a review for the majority of the people who are not from Florida and who don't have the luxury of camping here. We haven't taken the sea plane, but took the Yankee Freedom ferry out. It is a very expensive trip, but it is worth every penny. You will want to bring your bathing suit, sunblock, sunglasses, towels, cameras, maybe bug spray, and a hat.(believe it or not, I have seen a mosquito over by the camping area there.) There is a parking garage across from the terminal which is day parking only. If you are camping, you have to go down to the other parking garage which is a block down the street. I think we paid 20.00 for the parking. You cannot be late on this trip or they will leave you. I am not sure about refunds if you miss the boat, so check when you are making your reservation. They start off having you check in and getting your ticket, and then you are allowed to board. You are given a breakfast which is included in the day trip price. They also have a cash bar for snacks and drinks for purchase in between meals. It is about a 2 hour boat ride, and the boat is large with an upstairs and downstairs climate controlled cabin. The boat has 4 bathrooms on it, and seating is available outside for those who want to enjoy the wind and the waves and the possibility for seeing flying fish, ballyhoo, and sea turtles. You pull up to the island about 10:30am and they have a guided tour or a self tour you can take of this civil war fort. The fort itself has three tiers and you can go on all three tiers. On the third level is cactus, cannons, and a breathtaking view of the fort and the water. You also can see Loggerhead Key with the lighthouse in the distance. The second level has stalactites and stalagmites from dripping water and mineral deposits over the years. The ground floor has a small museum and gift shop. There is a moat wall surrounding the fort that you can walk on and around and the water is so clear you can see the fish and aquatic animals swimming around. It is a birding paradise for birders everywhere and has birds that nest only at the fort. I have also seen warblers, frigate birds, and even falcons there. There are hermit crabs all over the island so watch your step. Then from 11:00 to 1:00 they serve lunch on the boat which is deli sandwiches, chips, drinks, and cookies which are also included in the day trip price. After that, people have the choice of exploring the fort and taking pictures, or snorkeling. The snorkeling gear is included in the day trip cost, so you don't have to buy any. Snorkeling along the moat wall and over by the pylons are the best areas. At 2:00, they want the guests to start coming back to the boat and they have hoses to rinse off and changing rooms on the dock. The boat leaves back for Key West at 2:30. I love standing out front because I usually see flying fish and sea turtles. The boat docks back at Key West around 5:00.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a sea plane over which is a very cool experience. You can view shipwrecks, Marquesas Keys, privately owned islands, and of course wildlife. Or you can take a ferry over to the island and enjoy the ride. Either way you need to go. The Dry Tortugas are awesomely beautiful, there are multiple colors of blue in the water and the calm there is wonderful. You can literally just walk the perimeter to view active sea life, walk the interior and exterior of the fort to explore and take some fantastic photos.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This tour came up as one of the things to do during your stay in the Keys and it was amazing. Ran by the US Parks Department, you will take a 2.5 Hour catamaran ride each way, bring a book or some cards cuz it can get boring after about an hour of looking for turtles off the bow.Arrive early and snag a seat, people will ""camp"" a bag in their seats and after a while it can be hard to find somewhere to sit down. The cabins are AC cold and the deck is windy sun... Choose wisely.But... when you get to Fort Jefferson... it is just plain amazing. In the middle of no where this giant brick fort rises from the sand. Truly a marvel to behold.What I didn't know before I went;1. You can camp on the island. they have tree covered camping spots that you can stay at for up to 3 nights and see sunsets and a star show unlike anywhere else in the US. The fort is locked up at night, but you have full run of the island and the moat barrier surrounding the fort and island.2. Snorkling, do it! It was amazing. Both the north and south ends of the island. They are different in they wave size and wildlife. From Parrot Fish to Barracuda (some as long as 3 feet) can be seen easily, as well as Conch and Jellyfish galore. The gear they give you is OK, leaky and old, but unless you bring your own (which we saw many people doing) it is all you have. Make sure to visit the old metal pylon areas off the concrete slabs for the best snorkeling. While we were there, the south side (where the boat docks) was the calmest and best for that day, the North side was choppy and had some good sized swell that could swamp your snorkel if you weren't paying attention.3. Be back on the boat at 2:45... they ardent kidding, the boat left and we had to go back for 2 german guys that didn't quite understand that, yup, at 2:45 were leaving. We got out about 2 miles and had to turn the boat back around and get them. As a consolation we had an amazing sunset due to the delay, see the pix.4. The knob on the bathroom, yup turn it 3 times... you'll get this when your on the boat.5. There is a open bar on the ride back, reasonable priced too... Beer, wine, blended, and over the rocks. $3-$6 each. 6. It is a 10 hour day, bring snacks, they feed you and Ok breakfast and a better lunch, don't miss it. When its over its over.So if your here, I would say camp at least one night at the fort, snorkel for sure, and partake at the bar on the trip home!","November 15, 2016","Long ride to get there, but worth every second.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Seaplane out to the Dry Tortugas National Park. The ride was very interesting--we saw sharks & turtles in the water from the air. The fort is interesting but the snorkeling was magnificent (and we were only able to enter the south end area). We snorkeled around the old pilings from a dock--great place for coral to grow. Magnificent coral, fish, and a huge (6' plus) grouper was hanging around. Also, lots of tiny fish swimming around. We also saw large fish (tarpon?). Anyway, I want to go back to have time to snorkel in the other areas. Amazing.","November 8, 2016",Some of the best snorkeling ever.,17,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were in Key West in August and decided to check out this park 70 miles off the coast in the gulf. You can take a 45 minute sea plane ride each way or what we did and take the 2-1/2 hour each way Yankee Freedom ferry. You depart Key West at 8am and arrive back about 5pm. The ride is pretty smooth in August and doesn't feel that long. They serve breakfast and lunch on board and it is included with the fare. Dry Tortugas is historical as it was an army fort at one time...you can sign up for the group tour which lasts roughly an hour. The beaches are incredibly beautiful, the water is amazing and the entire park is chock full of breath taking views! We snorkeled, saw sting rays, sharks, conch, pelicans, and a slew of other fish and wildlife. You may even see a salt water crocodile that took home to the island. It was really a great day, and we had a lot of fun! Be sure to pack sunscreen, and stay hydrated throughout the day. It gets pretty hot! There is overnight and multiple night camping grounds available also, but you must reserve in advance... the earlier the better. There is a coast guard station on site and a park police if needed. FYI... There is no cell phone service available, and once the ferry departs at 230pm, there wont be another until the next day when it arrives at 1030am... so don't miss the boat! On the way home enjoy a nice frozen cocktail or something else cold and refreshing, relax, listen to the tunes and enjoy the beautiful sights and relaxing ride home.","November 5, 2016","AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL, AND AWESOME!!!",46,"Neptune, New Jersey",5

Key West is always worth the time and effort to visit so there was really no down side.The trip out and back to Fort Jefferson was easy and comfortable, breakfast and lunch were provided on the boat.

Most, like us, will need to splurge on the ferry to get there, but experience is well-worth it, especially if you get to do some snorkeling. We had beautiful weather, not too hot or humid, but a bit windy which made the water a bit too murky for snorkeling, but we were able to enjoy walking around the fort and the moat. This is the best place to see the Tortugas Light House, which is undergoing repair thus enclosed with scaffolding,. If that is a problem, you might want to call ahead as the trip out there is quite expensive. There is a small gift shop and small museum, as well.","October 26, 2016",Great historical site,16,"Tampa, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"There are two ways to get out to Dry Tortugas National Park - Sea Plane or Boat. Sea Plane was too expensive for us, so we took the Yankee Freedom (a ferry that carries about 250 people) out to Dry Tortugas. It still cost us $575 for a family of four using a $25 off coupon. It is about 70 miles one way so plan on this being an all day event. It takes about 2.5 hours by boat. We left at 8:00 and Yankee Freedom supplied a small, decent breakfast on the boat. On the way, we passed a sea turtle and dolphins. We are decent snorklers and have our own gear. If you are an avid snorkler, I highly recommend you bring your own gear if you have it. The reasoning is once you dock at Dry Tortugas, if you have your own gear, you can disembark the boat and head out immediately to snorkle. We were snorkling for a good 30 minutes before other snorklers were even in the water. If you do not have snorkling gear, I would not worry. The crew was very organized and had the other passengers set up and running in no time. Lunch was served on the boat between 11:00 - 1:00 and it was good. Cold Cuts, variety of breads, cheeses, lettuce, dressings all to make sandwiches or salads. Fresh fruit, cookies, chips, water, and pop. For my family of four, there was more than enough food and drinks. Especially to satisfy a teenage boy's appetite. After lunch we quickly explored Fort Jefferson. If we had more time, I would have spent more time exploring and learning about the history of the facility. However, we had to be back on the boat by 2:45 to head back, so this portion of our trip was shortened as we wanted to explore 2 other areas around the Fort in regards to snorkling. The ride back was relaxing and the Yankee Freedom opened up the bar for those who would like to have a beverage on the 2.5 hour journey back to Key West. Our ride home was a little choppy. If you are proned to motion sickness, I do recommend that you take Dramimine an hour before the morning launch and again around 1:30 for the return trip home. My daughter and I never got sick and both of us are proned to motion sickness. We arrived back in Key West at 5:30.The entire crew of the Yankee Freedom is helpful and courteous. My entire family enjoyed this trip, and the only complaint was that we did not have enough time. However, if we chose to, we could have stayed overnight and camped. An option that I noticed a couple fellow passengers chose to do. Maybe next time.","October 25, 2016",Dry Tortugas National Park and Fort Jefferson,19,"Savage, Minnesota",5

Having said that, I would highly recommend this trip, it is amazing to see this old Civil War era fort out in the middle of the ocean! The trip out and back on the ferry was enjoyable, the ferry is nice, clean and well maintained, they do encourage Dramamine, just in case, it can be a rough ride at times. Exploring the fort is fun, the views are amazing! The beaches are beautiful, the snorkeling was not very good on the day we were there, but that can vary on any given day.

This is one of those places you just have to see. 67 miles from Key West, you are slapped up side your head with beauty and history all at once. Named in 1513 by Ponce de Leon the islands offer a glimpse of the past and the perfect retreat from cell phones, and the outside world. The crystal clear water is amazing for snorkeling and swimming - warm and inviting. The white sand beaches are perfect for soaking up the sun and if you feel like an adventure, you might come face to face with the resident crocodile.

I recommend sitting on the main level. The bathrooms are here, the food is served here, and there is a lovely back area to stand outside. The trick is to go out there whenever not eating. We saw flying fish, a leatherback turtle, and an amazing number of jellyfish doing an underwater ballet. The people sitting inside could not see any of these things. The trip is about 2 1/2 hours and the staff go on the loud speaker and point out features as your are traveling. When you get there you pick up your snorkeling gear and explore. You come back to the boat to eat a light lunch. The history of the island is interesting but on the day we went it was blistering hot. The only way to get comfortable was to go in the warm ocean. It was cooler in the ocean than walking. The water was amazingly clear. Even without snorkeling you could see a lot. When it is time to leave there are changing rooms on the island. You can rinse off on the boat but no soap or shampoo allowed. Prepare to not have picture perfect hair for the trip home. Frozen drinks and snacks are for sale on the trip back.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My friend & I really wanted to do this excursion because we had heard great things about it. Because it is hurricane season I did not want to book it too early, so I waited until a couple of days before we wanted to go & then booked it. I was able to find a $25 off coupon code online. If I had booked 7 days in advance I would have gotten $50 off, but better safe than sorry. We got to the dock at 7am & checked in, which was easy. The gentleman who gave the instructions in the morning had a lot of energy & was fun, he went by the name Hollywood. We boarded the boat. The had a decent breakfast for us. All of the staff was friendly & helpful. They had told us that the seas were going to be 4-6 ft, which didn't sound like much to me. They sell Dramamine for $1 each so we bought & took some just in case. The seas were a bit rough & there were quite a few people getting sick. The crew was always there to help them. Thankfully my friend & I were fine. The fort itself was ok, lots of history that I didn't know about. Once we walked around the fort we grabbed lunch on the boat, which was also decent. They offered tuna, potato salad, cold cuts & such. After lunch we decided to try & snorkel. They had told us that the last few days there weren't that many fish around but we hoped for the best. Unfortunately, We did not see anything. The boat ride back was the same as going & the crew were all helpful again to them. I'm glad I finally went on this excursion but don't think I would pay that kind of money to go again.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was our third trip to Key West. In our previous years we have seen the entire island and have done the ""must-dos,"" however we saved Dry Tortugas for last. It was recommended from another TA user that you do the Tortugas once you have experienced the remainder of the island as this tour will zap an entire day of vacation. We chose to do the Yankee Freedom Ferry vs the plane. I weighed the pros and cons of both but opted for the ferry and I am happy with my decision.We boarded the ferry at 8am and returned to port about 430pm. The Ferry serves you breakfast and lunch as well as gives you snorkel gear to use while at Dry Tortugas. The inside of the ferry is air conditioned but I highly suggest sitting on the upper decks. You can see the marine life (we had dolphins, sea turtles, and mackerel) as well as enjoy the weather.Once at the fort you get about 4 hours to enjoy the grounds. There is a 1 hour tour available and it comes recommended. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and was great with answering questions. Be warned though, if you are afraid of heights like I am, it will test your boundaries.The stairs are steep and narrow. I made it to the second floor and had to send the Boyfriend to the third level with the camera.Make sure to check out the giftshop. If you have a national park passport book make sure to get your passport stamped!We snorkeled the rest of our time there using the availble gear provided. I enjoyed the shallow parts and the Boyfriend went out farther by the break walls. They saw lobster and all sorts of fish. Definitely worth doing! Its a great day on the water and you get two meals included in the price.","October 8, 2016",A definite must for the repeat KW visitor,12,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I went the last full day we were in the Keys. We took the Yankee Freedom ferry there and back. The trip both ways had calm waters and the boat ride there is worth the price alone. The views are priceless and you get to see a great amount of sea life on the ride. Breakfast, lunch and snorkeling equipment are provided. The hubby and I were first time snorkelers and we had an absolute blast. We came face to face with a barracuda, octopus and tons of fish, so many you felt like you were in Finding Nemo! I couldn't recommend this day trip enough, it was so amazing. Would definitely take this trip again next time we're in Key West.","October 7, 2016",Absolutely amazing,0,"Buffalo, New York",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"So amazingly beautiful, it is worth the day to check it out! A few notes I'd have would be to bring a back pack for your items and own refillable water & lunch so you don't have to stop and go back to the boat for lunch. There are so many fish to see, you might as well be snorkeling in a fish tank! It is a long day out in the sun so hindsight I would have done this on our 1st full day visiting Key West and then drinking on Duval St.Happy 100th Birthday to the NPS!!","October 7, 2016",A Full Day Adventure,4,"Houston, Texas",5

Snorkeling was just okay, not the best in the world, but was fun, calm water. They supply snorkel mask and fins. We took our own mask, but used there fins, no rental cost charged all included in the cost of the trip. The equipment was in great shape.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Dry Tortugas are incredibly beautiful and such an incredible place to snorkel, as well as wander the historic fort. Of the two options for travel (ferry or sea plane), we took the sea plane with Sea Plane Adventures and, though more expensive, it was well worth it - they really look after you, you get a great view of the island on arrival and departure and, most importantly have the island to explore with just 8 other people for 3 hours before the ferry turns up with ~100 more people.

I have never seen such beautiful water. The fort offered a great area to hike and the story behind the failed fresh water cisterns is really interesting, so don't miss the interpretive signage at the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"For folks staying in the lower keys or Key West wishing to make an unusual day trip offshore, the Dry Tortugas National Park and Fort Jefferson fit the bill. This outing is Ideal (though not cheap) for couples, campers, or families with kids wishing to learn about 19th century history, spend a day at sea, and snorkel in the gin clear waters of the Caribbean. The fort is accessible only by boat or seaplane, the former being the more popular and least expensive. We took the Yankee Freedom, a fast, aluminum hulled catamaran, costing about a $340.00 for two. The crossing takes about two hours each way, leaving about four hours to tour the fort, snorkel, or picnic on the island. Both a buffet breakfast and luncheon are served on the boat. For us the meals were the only disappointing aspects of the trip, consisting of very limited, predictable, and pedestrian choices of food, albeit they were fresh and served cold. We nearly missed the lunch because we missed the announcement, if there were one, saying that it would be served strictly between noon and one, a time when most people were touring or snorkeling. Still, we didn't go for the meal. The ride over was smooth on the day we traveled. And in route we saw numerous turtles, birds and other wildlife. The park itself is a sanctuary for birds, turtles and other wildlife, which were numerous. The boat was efficiently run, very smooth for those concerned about sea sickness (depending on the seas of course), and the staff was professional, if a bit aloof. Tours were offered by someone who seemed knowledgeable, but very chatty. The boat is senior friendly but might be challenging for anyone with difficulty in walking or getting in and out of fairly small and tight seating. There were plenty of seats though, and table space for eating or playing cards. All in all, we very much enjoyed this trip, the park, the fort, and a day out of Key West.","September 30, 2016",Day Trips From Key West,11,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",4

It is breathtaking in size, majesty, and beauty. It takes up the entire island, with very little beach left over. It was a fortress, and a death camp for many with yellow fever. I can not find another place in the world I would want to go to obtain photographs, and feel the emotions I felt when I was there. I recommend this trip more than any other activity in Key West.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We have lived in Key West for several years and have never been here so I finally took the plunge and bought the tickets to the Yankee Freedom cruise. Although pricey it turns out they were worth every penny. Before we left we were given a very informative speech including what to expect in detail as far as boarding, food, the island etc. The boat itself was very roomy and it didn't feel there were 175 passengers on board. More than enough seating for everyone. The food was very satisfying for both breakfast and lunch. The ride was about 2 1/2 hours and the water was like glass...stunning ride. I saw a couple turtles on the way but that was it. During the ride lots of information about the islands as well over the intercom.Once arrived we immediately walked the grounds and the fort. I am no history buff whatsoever but it really took me back to that time. The fort was fascinating. After doing that for over an hour we went snorkeling. We brought all our own gear so I can't comment on the service from the provided gear but the snorkeling itself was fantastic. We swam to the coral heads were we saw lobster, hogfish, eels and rays etc...gorgeous.At 2:00 bar was open with very reasonable priced drinks ($3 beer $5 mixed drinks)of course there is water, juices, soda and food offered as well. The staff was incredible. They really care about your experience and will do anything to make sure it's a good one. I can't speak more highly enough about this trip.

I don't do well on water and was pleasantly surprised at the smooth ride of the boat. Our guide for the trip, Jeffrey, was very passionate in his delivery of the history of the fort and the Dry Tortugas. He delivered a 20 minute talk when we arrived at the island as well as a walking tour that lasted much longer. We listened to his talk and then explored the fort on our own. They offer snorkel gear free of charge but the water was so clear that you could see everything just walking out in the water. There were lots of hermit crabs crawling around and many birds. Breakfast and lunch were served on the boat and the only restrooms were also on the boat. There was very little shade so make sure you slather the sunscreen on! We returned to Key West at about 5:30.

The ferry ride is 2 hours long and we hit extremely choppy waters, about 80% of the people on board got sea sick, so be prepared if you do not handle boats very well. Under calmer waters, I'm sure it's fine. You have about 3-4 hours on the island to explore the beaches and the fort. The fort is absolutely breathtaking!!!

The fort itself is beautiful being on its own island. If you love snorkeling it's the most amazing place to go. You need to go by the coaling wooden tower things where the coral grows (forget the name sorry). There were sting rays, parrot fish,huge conches & so many more amazing fish. The coral is beautiful/one of the best and we have snorkeled in many tropical places including Hawaii. You can camp out over night at this fort and it seems like it would be amazing. We would highly consider camping here just because, the trip on the ferry for a day isn't long enough. I never like to camp but, it's beautiful here.

There is occasional scenery along the way - but not much.The fort itself is fascinating. We did the 20-minute tour (which is really more of an introductory talk), then walked around on our own. A longer, guided tour is available. We spent some time snorkeling and relaxing on the beach. There are several nice beach areas, but not much shade. If you have a small beach umbrella - bring it!The lunch on board is a sandwich ""buffet"" with a selection of breads, meats, cheese and sides. It was more than adequate. On the way back, the bar was open with a variety of soft drinks and adult beverages.

Why defend this forsaken speck of sand in the middle of nowhere? It was like a maritime Maginot line. Hostile ships could always take a sail around it. I suspect that it was more like a tropical Siberia, or Guyana, a place to lock people up. Sure enough, it was used mainly as a prison. But everyone on this island was a prisoner.The massive walls were something. The truth was that I wouldn’t want to be here during a hurricane.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is loc one of the most remote destinations on the east coast of the United States as it's located on a small island roughly 70 miles due east of Key West, FL. There are only two ways to get there, by. boat or seaplane. Most of the reviews here were written by folks who arrived by commercial catamaran or seaplane out of Key West, FL. However, I took the path less traveled and sailed there from Key West. This is a 15 hour trip.The anchorage is located just south of Fort Jefferson and is a short dinghy ride into the Fort. The crystal clear water is 10 feet deep and well protected by a reef that nearly surrounds the anchorage.Fort Jefferson is built to a similar design as Fort Zachary Taylor in Key West, FL, but what's amazing is where it's built ... on a remote island in the middle of nowhere. The Fort is amazing, the rangers knowledgeable and friendly. Take lots of pics as this is the one place none of your friends have ever heard of.","September 13, 2016",The untraveled path,1,"Melbourne, Florida, United States",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I would recommend this trip to anybody with kids or that hasn't been snorkeling much. The boat was great, the crew was fantastic, lunch was OK, sandwiches etc. Snorkeling a little disappointing. The most interesting part was walking around the fort and island and reading about the history of the place. We left early in the morning and were on the boat about 2.5 hours. They served a buffet breakfast and you could walk around outside upstairs or down. The bathrooms were fine on the boat. When you get there you can get snorkeling gear right there and head straight to the beach. We packed a cooler which I recommend because it's very hot. Several beaches to visit but very little shade. Lunch is served on the boat. Sandwiches, cookies, chips, drinks. Ride back was fun because the bar was open. We were a little disappointed with the snorkeling. Very easy for beginners, right off the beach but not much variety of fish and not very colorful like I expected. The island is very dry with almost no rain so even if it's raining in Key West you will have good weather on the island. We took a cab from the hotel to the dock and that worked very well for us because we didn't have to give up our parking space at the hotel. Paid under $10 each way. There is parking at the dock. You get back to Key West around 5 pm. The kids LOVED it.","September 12, 2016",Very fun day,24,"Atlanta, Georgia",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We head down at least 2 times a year for the past 15 years. We are fortunate enough to take our own boat to fish and spend the night at the Fort. The water is crystal clear, the fish are huge and the Fort is something to see. Facilities are minimal, but that is part of why it is awesome. ","September 12, 2016",Must see.,7,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"WOW! I camped the night at the Dry Tortugas and it was very primitive. It was incredible. There may have been 20 people on the island over night. I have never seen the starts as brilliant as evening time here. The tour of Fort Jefferson was fantastic. Snorkeling was pretty good, but we came down right after Hurricane Hermine. The park rangers were top notch. Overall I can't wait to camp here again.","September 12, 2016",Amazing Camping Trip,25,"Massillon, Ohio",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This tour is a must do! From the staff on the boat, our tour guide, snorkel staff they were very friendly and attentive. The last much was better than the breakfast- a suggestion to improve on the breakfast would be to offer ready made breakfast sandwiches for easy and better tasting fare in a moving vessel! The ride, scenery and both educational and recreational experience is well worth the price.","September 11, 2016",First Visit ,70,New Jersey,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a trip we've wanted to take BY BOAT because we love being on the water. Overall, it was fabulous but some advice I was looking for but couldn't find might help others:1. Plan for a long day with swimwear and your most comfortable clothes and sandals/beach shoes. Take lots of sunscreen, some lotion, because they don't want you spraying sunscreen on the boat except on the back deck.2. Take a small cooler with extra drinks and snacks if possible but not a deal breaker as they serve lunch and breakfast on the boat.3. We were lucky the day we went because it wasn't full but at times it felt like it! On the way there people are up and walking around but on the way back NOT so much. Largest complaint was seating or lack thereof. On the way back I counted 3 couples seated on the floor while I counted >15 spread out sleeping on chairs and 3 couples who hogged each of the 6 tables to themselves. So if you want seating be standing near the door to board and go save seats when allowed back on the boat. They say you can't do this but I saw nobody policing it. We lucked out with seating; others not so much. It just takes courtesy but sadly I didn't see it much on our trip.4. When you get off the boat, can leave your items on any of the open picnic tables or go left to the beach under the trees - part of the very limited shade. Nobody touches it and you're free to explore.5. You have a choice of no tour, 20 minute talk or 1.25 tour. We listened to the 20 minute talk by Jeffrey which was excellent! Talk about someone who loves his job and knows A LOT about this fort and park!6. Walk around the moat fort and go up to the top where lighthouse is- best views!7. The sea plane passengers get RR privileges on the boat so plan accordingly lol8. You only have 4 hours! We explored the fort and swam and lazed in the water and ate lunch. You eat lunch in this 4 hours so keep that in mind.9. Yes you can take the seaplane; it costs more and it's all about preference. We've been to KW many times so the boat worked for us and was the best day they had after the week with the hurricane. Again, lucked out!10. The scenery and water are beautiful! The fort incredible!11. Plenty of parking near the terminal but yes there's a fee!12. A great day to unplug and recharge! Didn't miss cell phone service!13. There are small changing rooms on the island and fresh hot water rinse off on the back of the boat! That was great! 14. If you're camping, good luck!! I watched 2 couples fighting over a spot!","September 11, 2016",Bucket List Trip,44,"Clearwater, Florida",4

While the boat is clean, comfortable, serves food and drinks and the staff is v nice, it took the entire day for only 4 hours spent on the Dry Tortugas. The fort is really cool to walk through and on, but it was a long tiring trip. The plane would be worth the expense. Also, we didn't have good snorkeling that day.

The ferry advertises that it has wave abating technology to ensure a smooth trip. They were absolutely correct. You almost felt like you never on a boat. It was very smooth. The park is just incredible. We did the 20 minute oral history tour and it was very enjoyable. Jeff was our guide and truly has passion in explaining the relevance of the island and fort. I snorkeled around the island and saw about 30 different kinds of fish and while at sea, a couple of sea turtles. My wife spent her time enjoying the warm, clear water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,One of the most isolated and least visited National Parks. If you love outdoor beauty....you must visit. We took a seaplane...it costs more than the ferry but it only takes 40 minutes to get there vs. 2.5 hours. Take the first flight out or the last flight out. You'll avoid the ferry crowds. We took the 10am flight and got there right as the ferry was unloading (my bad). It wasn't terrible being there with all the ferry people (Ha!) but it would have been nicer with less people...anyway...we did the half day and snorkeled for basically 2 hours. Get out to the reefs and you'll see a ton of fish. The sea grass doesn't have much to see. We didn't get a chance to tour the fort but I heard that's cool with all its' history.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I visited Key West this past weekend for our two-year anniversary. A few weeks earlier, I was looking online for stuff to do and I found out about the trips to Dry Tortugas National Park and I knew that we had to do this. We took the seaplane and got to see the park from the sky. After exploring Fort Jefferson for about an hour, we went snorkeling and saw lots of fish. This was a fantastic experience. If you go to Key West, you have to go to Dry Tortugas! The only problem is that it's only accessible by boat or plane and the tours are pricey. It cost about $600 for me and my wife to fly there. Also, there is supposedly a tour of Fort Jefferson but when we got there, we didn't see a tour guide so we just wandered around like everyone else.

If it's your first time going, definitely take the guided tour.Snorkeling was incredible, except for one small problem that I'll mention in my ""tips."" The fish and coral were beautiful and the water was a refreshing retreat from the heat.Some tips: 1. Bring plenty of sunscreen. There are hardly any clouds out there, so you're gonna get burned if you don't.2. Hydrate! If you're going in the summer, drink plenty of water. There's not much of a breeze, so you could get overheated pretty quickly.3. Don't swim with your cell phone. Yep, I did that.

The views from atop the fort are amazing and going through the fort is a good walking tour for all ages. Be sure to ask about the Junior Ranger program for elementary aged kids. They have to find clues and answer questions in a booklet and can get sworn in and receive a badge as a Junior Ranger. The snorkeling from the beach is not to be missed either. Even for someone who is not a big fan of snorkeling, it's full of life and be sure to bring an underwater camera.The boat I cannot say enough great things about the staff and captain. It's a well-organized trip with great information and plenty of food and drinks. The vessel is very stable with both inside and outside seating on two decks. There are plenty of bathroom facilities too.The boat will provide snorkel gear if you don't have your own along with a BC (floatation) which I would recommend for novice snorkelers.It's a higher priced attraction but a full day of activity especially if you go on the boat.

The tour also provides snorkeling equipment - just bring towels and change of clothing, lots of sunscreen and water (the ferry also has water available). There are two beach areas on the island, no shade and some good snorkeling areas.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This seems like one of the first opportunities for the government to have wasted money back in the 1800s. No matter how it's portrayed, its construction really made little sense. It's definitely interesting to explore. The park rangers are extremely enthusiastic. As a boater who anchored here for 3 nights, we were irritated by a commercial boater anchored there who had a gas-powered roof-mounted generator on the entire time. He needs to invest in a diesel generator! So much for even a few hours of silence in the middle of nowhere. We were told that there was a mooring buoy on the far side of Loggerhead Key, but there wasn't. Leaving a dinghy on their designated dinghy beach is hazardous. A Mediterranean moor should be allowed. Sure, kayaks can be dragged ashore, but not a RIB with a motor. Decent, accessible mooring balls should be added; ones that don't require 100 yards of swimming.

I questioned the wisdom of the captain at about two miles out. Everything was fine till a half hour into it. Then the puke flowed. Luckily I was fine But the crew was very much on it. Bags for everyone. But Fort Jefferson was awesome. I would definitely do it again but on a day that the wind isn't blowing 25kts. ,"August 23, 2016",Rough ride,14,,4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the Yankee freedom ferry. It was a bit of a long trip to get there but well worth it! The place is beautiful and not crowded. The ferry crew is awesome, very informative and professional. Bring a book or get comfortable with your neighbors as there is no wifi. I personally like that the ferry didn't offer wifi as it gave me a chance to leave the emails and phone calls behind! The island itself is beautiful. This is something you must do if you're going to key west! ","August 23, 2016",Loved it! ,1,"Long Beach, California",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom Ferry to Dry Tortugas. The ferry provided breakfast (continental) and a lunch. Food was decent and the staff was organized in their presentation! We decided to do the guided tour of Fort Jefferson, which was informative, but very hot. We ate quickly on the boat, got our snorkel gear and headed to the ocean. Snorkeling was fantastic and the water is beautiful! It was such an amazing experience and I would definitely do it again! It's expensive, but well wort it!","August 22, 2016",Simply Amazing,10,"Staten Island, New York",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"So I definitely enjoyed this, but for the price and everything involved I wouldn't say it was truly amazing. To get out there its about $150 per person and nearly a 3 hour boat ride each way. Which means you don't get a ton of time on the island, which isn't that big of a deal because there's really only two things to do. 1 - Snorkel. 2 - Tour the Fort. The snorkeling is OK, if you want good snorkeling then you have to swim out about 70 yards to the reef. That's a pretty far swim that most people and familys probably won't be taking. I know that because I saw zero people go out that far while we were there. And with most rental equipment, the snorkel gear they give you doesn't work that well. That being said the island was beautiful and the Fort was really neat with some interesting history. Breakfast was basically cereal and some fruit but lunch was better with some cold meats to make a sandwich, snacks, and drinks. My suggestions to those booking this:1- Don't get there 30 minutes before boarding like your email confirmation tells you to! We didn't actually start boarding until about 7:40 and there's plenty of room on the boat.2- If you really want to snorkel then bring your own gear if possible. 3- Pack a bag! Don't forget you're on a tiny island with nothing other than the boat and the Fort. Bring your sun tan lotion, something to hide from the sun, towels, suntan lotion, etc.4- Get extras at lunch. It's kind of weird, you arrive and lunch starts like an hour later. Either way, theres lot of snacks and sodas at lunch for free, but as soon as lunch is closed you have to pay for them (lame for $150 trip). So if you think you might want a drink at like 2pm, or a snack, then just grab a little extra at lunch and take it in your bag.5- If you get motion sickness bring something for it! The boat is pretty smooth and ya 90% of you will be fine, but getting motion sickness (like my wife) on a 3 hour boat ride can really ruin the trip. Lots of little pop up storms go by that area, and you may not hit them but good chance it will be a little choppy for parts of the trip.","August 22, 2016","Good experience, but some drawbacks",9,"Chicago, Illinois",3

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped there for 3 days in December and it was truly one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I cannot recommend this enough. Camping at Fort Jefferson has got to be one of the most unique camping destinations available within the National Park System. After the boat leaves with all of the day-trippers, you get to explore the area like no one else. The fort remains opens until dusk and you get to have it all to yourself. Walking the halls, walls, and grounds of Fort Jefferson by yourself is a wonderful experience. It also provides photo opportunities like no other.The camping is primitive and you have to pack in (& carry out) everything. While the ferry is docked you get to make use of all onboard facilities. After the ferry leaves, you get to use the on-site composting toilets on the island. There is no running water so this means you have to bring in your water as well. If you're used to camping, chances are that you've experienced this elsewhere. This camping experience isn't your standard park or car camping. If you have a chance, camp here for at least one night. You will never experience brighter star fields or a more quiet camping destination.","August 22, 2016",Amazing Camping Experience!!,48,"North Palm Beach, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a bucket list type of day. It is a bit pricey, but well worth every penny. We went with a family of 4. My kids are 13 and 14. My daughter loved snorkeling around the crystal clear water and my son loved Fort Jefferson. We took the Yankee Freedom III and the staff were knoweldgable and fun. A continental type breakfast is provided along with a lunch which is sandwiches, salads, chips, and fruit. There are 4 bathrooms on the boat which service the entire island. You get approximately 4 hours on the island which we felt went by extremely quickly. I would have liked to had more time there. It is a 2hr 20min boat ride each way, keep this in mind if you have small children. The day we visited, the weather was sunny and 95F, definitely take sunscreen and a hat as there is very little shaded area on the island.","August 22, 2016",Highlight of or Family Vacation.,3,"Chambersburg, Pennsylvania",5

We took the ferry but next time we will go by seaplane just to have a different view. I also don't think we will tour the fort next time. We did an hour tour this trip and it was great. I highly recommend doing that once. Next time I'm going to take some amazing pictures and play on the beach and in the cool water, snorkel more and bask in the beauty of this place.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas was the highlight of our family trip to Key West. We took the sea plane instead of the ferry. Although the plane is pricy, it was definitely worth it! The plane seats about 10 people and allows great views of turtles, chugs, and shipwrecks. For a cheaper plane trip, book the half day instead of full day excursion. A half day is definitely enough time to check out the National Park's offerings of snorkeling, checking out the fort, and taking a stroll through the island. It also offers a cool Junior Ranger program!! Families with young children have to be careful--no railings at the top of the fort. Wear sunblock even on a cloudy day if you're going to be snorkeling.","August 19, 2016",A Must!,59,"DeWitt, Michigan",5

The plane ride was great, as you can see turtles, Rays, and all of the boats that got stuck and abandoned, assumed from Cuba. On the island it is hot but the fort has some great things to look at.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Just got back from a trip to the Dry Tortugas and the reviews are right... IT'S WONDERFUL! My wife and I love boats, but after reading all of the various reviews, we decided to spend the extra money to take the seaplane there for a half day trip in the afternoon. It was definitely the best way to go for us. The flight was really a special part of the whole trip as you only fly about 500 feet high so you are able to see turtles and sunken ships and other islands in the water on the trip out and back. The other thing we liked about the flight option was that part of the special allure of this island fort is its remoteness, so even though the island never felt busy when the ferry boat was in, we totally felt like we had the island all to ourselves after it departed. There are 2 seaplanes and each only only holds 10 passengers. 2.5 hours island time was tight, but it was enough time to walk the fort and do some snorkeling for us. Key West really doesn't have much for clean sandy beaches on the gulf side (and certainly no remoteness), but the beach and the water of the Dry Tortugas are beautiful and this is what you think of when you picture yourself on a Florida Key. Pilots can suggest the best areas for snorkeling based upon the weather. Most people snorkel the walls of the moat, but there are also coral heads and abandoned piers. The posts about packing your own lunch including beverages are right since there is no food for purchase (but that way you get to eat what you actually want). The company does provide a small cooler with ice/water/soda for your use which is pretty convenient. This was the highlight of our Key West trip.","August 17, 2016",Dry Tortugas was the highlight of our Key West Trip,16,"Gilbert, Arizona",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,A bit of an investment but totally worth it! We took the Yankee Freedom over and their service was great. The day in the Dry Tortugas was perfect.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We decided to go out to the Dry Tortugas for a full day trip on the seaplane, and it was the best way to go, hands down! There is a half day option available, but once we were done walking the fort, there was only 40 min until the half day group was scheduled to leave. I'm so glad we chose the full day to get the most out of it. The seaplanes hold 10 passengers, and 2 planes leave in the morning. The flight was very smooth, and our captain John was fantastic. We saw tons of turtles on the way there, and on the way home, we saw turtles and a shark. The flight is about 35 min or so, and when you arrive on the island, the only people there are the seaplane passengers, park rangers, and the campers. We decided to set up our stuff on the north beach, under a nice grove of trees for shade. I was glad that we came out in the morning, as the shady spots were still available. After we set up our spot, we decided to walk the fort before the crowds and the full heat of the day settled in. The fort was very interesting to see, and it's hard to imagine what it took to build it. After touring the fort, we went back to our spot on the beach to sunbathe for a little while. Once the ferry boat arrived, there were a LOT more people on the island, and a lot of people who came and set their stuff up very close to us, to try to get some shade. I can't hold that against them, but after being so secluded in the morning, it was different. The beach and the water were absolutely beautiful. I snorkeled along the walls of the moat, and then out to the coral heads to the west, and it was some of the best snorkeling that I have ever done, we saw so many fish--too many to name off. If you go on a sea plane, be sure to pack a lunch, as there is no food for purchase. We brought a small backpack cooler with some sandwiches, canned beer, and water, and the seaplane company also provides you with a cooler with ice and water or sodas. Alcohol is permitted in the park, but no glass bottles. Be sure to take all your trash back with you, to keep our national parks beautiful!","August 16, 2016",Amazing,4,"San Antonio, Texas",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Great remote location of a former military base, turned into a museum. Fort Jefferson is in ruins, but the story behind it is quite interesting. You can go there by ferry in 2hs or in hydroplane in a half an hour. The best plan is the snorkeling around the for mote. Underwater walls have reefs that grew over centuries, and plenty of sea species and colorful fish. You have to surround the fort to appreciate it. It takes 30 minutes with fins and masks. There are more coral reefs in the surrounding areas. For camp lovers, itt is also possible to camp if you book in advance a campsite, for a modest fee.","August 16, 2016",Time travel,38,"Miami, Florida",5

While the ferry operators make every effort to make the trip enjoyable, it is still a long time on a ferry. If you are good with that, I highly recommend this option. Otherwise, I would suggest springing the extra money and taking a seaplane there instead. The fort is just amazing to visit. The water is aqua blue and clear. The ferry operator provides free snorkeling equipment and even if you have never snorkeled before (like myself), take advantage of this option here!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"So, I have a bucket list item to go to every National Park in the US. Dry Tortugas is a 2.5 hr boat ride west of Key West, so to get there you obviously have to be in Key West first. I've never had much of a desire to go to KW, but my friends and I planned a 4th of July trip down there & make Dry Tortugas the highlight of the trip. It's a little pricey if you really don't have an idea of what you are getting into (I promise you will NOT regret spending the $$$ once you have been) but it's SO worth it. I say book the Yankee Freedom ferry-they provide you lunch and all gear you need once you get to the island. If you are into History, the fort itself is super cool. The beaches & water a picture perfect & the snorkeling is a blast. If I ever go back to KW again, I would without a doubt do this trip again. Be prepared to spend the entire day on this outing as the boat ride itself is 5 hours round trip. Take some cards or a book to read on the way out there-I napped since we had to get up before the sun to make it. On the way back, they serve drinks on the boat & I think it's best to take the drinks outside on the deck and enjoy the view (albeit it's just water) but you can sometimes see lots of cool marine life around you (turtles, dolphins, etc). If you are on the fence about this, JUST DO IT!!!!!! I promise you won't regret it!","August 15, 2016","This is THE reason I went to Key West...no, really it was!",0,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We traveled to the Dry Tortugas via the Yankee Freedom III from Key West. It was a two and a half hour boat ride each way, but well worth the trip!When we arrived at the fort, we took our own walking tour around the outside and interior, exploring each of the three floors. There is some signage around to help educate the self-guided tourist. We were surprised to see cacti growing on a tropical island! The grounds are beautifully maintained and preserved, and there is lots of history to take in. Of course, the best part of the fort itself is the view from the top. Absolutely breathtaking!After our tour, we had lunch on the boat, then returned to the island for snorkeling. We brought our own snorkeling gear rather than using what was provided by our charter. We had previewed maps of the island and best snorkeling areas ahead of time. We started out trying to visit the south coaling dock ruins, but the water was too rough for us to feel safe swimming between the pylons (we felt we were going to get pushed into them pretty frequently). So, we swam the perimeter of the ruins, then headed out along the moat wall and toward the coral reef heads. You can't see them from land or from looking out over the water, but if you swim away from the island toward the white bouys that mark the perimeter of the snorkeling area, you will find them! They are gorgeous! We saw so many different schools of fish, many varieties of coral, and overall some of the most beautiful sights we've ever seen! We were told by a couple that camped on the island for three nights that the wildlife was much more varied after the boat left or before the boat arrived each day. There were sharks and goliath grouper frequently spotted when the boat was not around. We were also told the stars at night from the remote island were absolutely stunning. I'm looking forward to camping here in the future so I can see it for myself!The beaches and water were absolutely beautiful.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited Dry Tortugas National Park with our two teenaged kids (17, 19), and all of us absolutely LOVED the experience. The ferry to the island was booked, and although I initially ruled out using the seaplane as transportation because of the cost (the price difference between the seaplane and ferry is about $140 per person), the concierge at our resort recommended we consider it, so we were added to their wait list. We weren't sorry that we chose this option after we made the trip!The seaplane ride to Fort Jefferson was an experience on its own. The ride was about 40 minutes each way, and we got some great aerial photos. The water was gorgeous, and we were able to see a few sea turtles and some shipwrecks along the way.Seeing the fort and snorkeling in the waters around it was equally amazing! The fort was interesting to explore and photograph, and since one of my kids was a snorkeling novice, the shallow waters offered a great platform for learning. He immediately felt comfortable and was a pro in no time!The only down side to this trip was that we would have loved more time there. If you are a camper, you may wish to consider that option to be able to enjoy as much of the island you can while you're there (although I'm not sure there are restrooms there...you'd need to check).What I didn't realize when planning our trip was that ferry and seaplane are the only ways to get out to Dry Tortugas, so you need to plan your reservations a couple weeks in advance in order to avoid the chance that they will be booked up. I believe both can be done online. This is a trip I'd highly recommend to anyone who enjoys snorkeling, photography, and/or history.

The majority of people and I were hit with seasickness and the Dramamine did not work or wore off during the 2 hour ride there and 2 hours back. Save up for the plane because you will have more time to explore. There are some scenic spots along the way and we did see dolphins! When you get to the fort, it really is incredible because the fort had such detail for being man made! The precision of the layout is amazing! Our guide was the best guide because he made history come to life! Believe me when I say that because I am a teacher! I am telling you that the tour was the absolute best! I learned so much about the history, but in a way that was not boring! We snorkeled near the beach, however, I did not see any reefs or a variety of fish.

Nice breakfast and lunch, professional friendly crew. The all of a sudden on the horizon you see something; you get closer and it starts to rise out of the sea, you go around the island/fort to the dock and it looks huge. Only when you go in the fort and you go to the top of the wall can you really understand how massive this is. How on an island with no natural water source or infrastructure could people have built this , truly amazing. Take the time to explore.Oh yes then there is the beach and snorkeling. The water is a color not seen too often, clear, many tropical fish...then you realize you need to be back on the ferry or you are left there.You are on the island for hours, but it seems like it went by in minutes.Next time we will camp overnight.Do not miss this gem.,","August 5, 2016",One of best National Parks,15,,5

The beach and island did not seem crowded because there was so much room for everybody to have their own space. It was an excellent day and one of the highlights of our trip.The ferry boat service provided us lunch as well, so we never got hungry. They also provided plenty of water to rehydrate during the day.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited the Dry Tortugas via seaplane, which allows you to really appreciate the remoteness of your destination. (If you choose this option, read my review of Key West Seaplane Adventures...a great company to use.) Our 2pm flight got us to the park just as the last boat tour was loading up, so our plan to avoid the crowds worked out perfectly. For the most part, we felt like we had the place to ourselves, just 2 seaplanes, a small number of boats, and some campers. Our 2 & 1/2 hour visit at the fort was plenty of time to explore and snorkel. We walked the entire fort, reading the informational placards along the way, then jumped in the water to cool off. We snorkel around some old pilings that were covered in coral and sea life. After exploring this area, being carefully not to hit anything with our fins, we moved to a small beach where we then snorkeled along the fort wall. More coral, fish, and the occasional conch. Lots to see. The island's facilities are limited, so you'll need to bring your own drinks, snacks, towel, sunscreen, and snorkel equipment. Make sure you grab at least one water because after a swim, that fresh water over the head will feel nice. The visit to the fort was fun, but I think getting there was the best part of trip, so if you can, I'd highly recommend a seaplane ride over.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Yes, the ferry ride was long and a bit pricey, but it was absolutely worth it. My wife and I went more for the scenery than the history, but there was more to do than there was time to do it. A walk around the moat wall was worth it. The snorkeling on the southern beach wasn't anything special (stay along the moat wall), but the south coaling dock ruins had the best corals and fish. Luckily, the day we were there the waves were only 2 to 3 ft. It would have been dangerous with waves any bigger.

I didn't have time to go to the north beach. They gave us a warning about currents, but I feel it wasn't strong enough. On the day we went the currents were much too strong around the coaling piers for any but the strongest swimmers.

Samuel Mudd, the doctor who set Booth's leg after President Lincoln's assassination, was held prisoner here, along with four other conspirators in the assassination. You will also see the Dry Tortugas lighthouse, and the Loggerhead Lighthouse in the distance.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This trip was AWESOME! It is a long day however, it was totally worth it! Before you board: make sure you have your tickets in advance because this does sell out, get a seat on the ferry quickly because people were really terrible (this was the only part I really didn't care for) - 2 people sitting at a table for 4, it was hard to eat breakfast. However, my fiance and I mostly stood outside and enjoyed the boat ride. The beach was amazing though - we did go on the tour buuut you can get a lot of that information on the website. They have snorkel gear with your ferry ticket which my partner in crime took part in, he said it was amazing and beautiful and that there were a ton of fish. The water is stunning. Be prepared for a line in the changing rooms though as there are only two womens stalls so plan your time accordingly. Lunch is just cold cuts so if you want something more substantial, bring it with you (I still have some serious shade to throw at the guy who cut in front of me and touched the cookies with his bare hands, ew). There are tons of wildlife (I saw a sea turtle on the ferry ride back) on the island and there aren't a million people and no cell phone service. For a national park, I wish more people knew about it because it was AWESOME. Just a note: pay attention to the videos, you aren't supposed to take anything from the island or touch the reef because it can damage the ecosystem. I saw people taking items from the beach and it was really sad. Buy a souvenir, or save your ticket as a memento, don't ruin the park because you are selfish. I loved it - I hope you go there!","July 30, 2016",Hidden Gem,4,,5

During our trip, the snorkeling was best as you got further away from the beaches (e.g. around the West and NW sides of the fort). Use your time wisely.

Once you arrive on Garden Key you can tour Fort Jefferson on your own or with the guided tour. The water is beautiful and you can swim or snorkel. There is coral growing on the wall that surrounds the fort. You can walk on the wall and see colorful little fish swimming below. You can walk around in the water and see them also.

Other than the fort and water, there is not much to do there, so do not be surprised with how little is actually there. The ferry service we went with had allotted about 4 hours on the island.

Maybe we got lucky with calm seas - but this boat is BIG. If you're worried about motion sickness - pick a seat in the downstairs cabin toward the center of the boat. Also, try Dramamine Naturals (ginger capsules). There is plenty of room for everyone. It's nice and air-conditioned with tables. They feed you breakfast and lunch and have snacks and drinks available for purchase on the way back. The 2+ hour boat ride didn't even seem long - we brought cards and played and time went by fast. We had smooth seas coming and going. The fort was interesting - we spent maybe 30 min on a self tour, but what we really enjoyed was the snorkeling - thought the area between the wall and pylons was the best - saw barracuda, lobster, snapper, and all kinds of fish and the water was warm.","July 26, 2016","So Beautiful, Great Snorkeling",19,"Cedar Park, Texas",5

I rode on a seaplane, which appeared to me to be the way to go. The ferry seems crowded and a lengthy trip. It appears to be a catamaran in its most jumbo form, so I don't know the difference between advertised ferry vs. catamaran trips. But the seaplane trip is wonderful from the air and allows more time on the island. Which is the point, don't you think? Sea life is easily spotted from the air, and the vibe on the cay is great.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our trip to Key West began with a trip to the Dry Tortugas. The trip was approximately 9 1/2 hours long although 5 hours is traveling time round trip. We booked a tour on the Yankee Freedom. The boat holds approximately 175 people and can be cramped. Breakfast and lunch were provided. The movement of the boat provided a relaxing atmosphere and many travelers were able to nap to reserve their energy for their snorkeling adventures. On the way to the park, we saw a sea turtle and some flying fish. The water was spectacular. The different shades of blue was absolutely stunning. For those that like the camp, I recommend spending a few days on the island. The fort was spectacular. However, I did not have time to view the fort as my husband and I spent most of our time in the glorious waters. We were slightly disappointed in the snorkeling. We headed out from the north beach. One of the representatives from the boat recommended this spot and told us to swim out the swim buoys. There was a reef there, and we did see some fish, but not what I was expecting. I was later told that the walls and pilings around the fort is the best place to snorkel. My husband and I brought our own equipment so if you want to avoid a leaky mask, it is best to bring your own to ensure proper fit; however, equipment is provided for you. Flotation vests are provided and is recommended for those that tire easily, especially children.Please, please, please, be mindful of the environment. Do not touch anything with your hands or your swimming fins. This will kill the coral. In addition, there are fire coral in the waters and you want to have a positive experience.All in all, although my husband and I did not see the fish we were expecting and at the time decided we would not return, I have decided if we return to Key West (and I very much would like to), we would give the Dry Tortugas another try.","July 25, 2016",Beautiful Views!,6,"Hudson, Florida",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I went to the Dry Tortugas before we had kids and now we are back 20 years later to take our children. This time we rode the Yankee Freedom ferry as opposed to the seaplane the last time. The boat ride was about 2 hour 20 minutes and the boat was comfortable and the staff very nice and helpful. Saw many many sea turtles both ways along with dolphins and loads of flying fish. Breakfast and lunch were good. Appropriate although not luxury.The islands themselves are surrounded by multihued gorgeous blue and green water that you can only find in the Caribbean usually. Very clear. Could easily see bottom in 40 feet of water.Fort Jefferson is unbelievable and interesting. Our oldest son ended up sending half his day just wandering around and learning about the fort. The fort takes up about 75% of teh island's land and is surrounded by a moat. Our kids had only limited experience snorkeling and this place is ideal to learn. Two sandy beaches with reefs just offshore. If you start off around the moat wall, you will always be in chest deep water, although be careful you only stand on sand and not the coral. Also, there is a lot of fire coral, which is another reason not to touch anything. The best snorkeling was around the pilings at the north and south coaling shores. Note that on any given day, different parts of the island will be clearer than others. On our day that was the south coaling pier. Saw loads of tropical fish and one 5 foot tarpon that just glided right past. No nurse sharks, which was a little disappointing, but otherwise it was a perfect start for our kids to learn snorkeling.If you go, please remember not to touch the coral, as just touching kills it, and also wear a sunscreen which is not harmful to the reefs (clear zinc is best).One tip: If you can, bring your own mask and snorkel. They are not that expensive. Although the crew will give you loaner equipment, it is not high quality, and bringing your own will save you the hassle of getting leaky masks or snorkels, which we saw a lot of form other people. You only have about 4 hours on the island and trekking back and forth to test out new gear (which is set up 100 yards form the beach) would be a big time waster. You want to be in the water as much as possible here.Also, getting back to the boat early and getting a table along the windows is nice. They fill up fast and are especially good for the way home, as there are walls and windows to rest your weary head and doze. The ones in the corners are best. Also, if you are prone to motion sickness, candied ginger is a miracle, and also try and go out to the bow viewing area in the front middle of the boat.All in all, this was one of the prettiest and most interesting places my wife and I remembered from prior Keys visit, and it is good to see it has not changed.","July 24, 2016",Unbelievable,92,"Shenandoah Valley, Virginia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I can't say enough wonderful things about the Dry Tortugas national park. There is only one company that charters to the Park, the Yankee Freedom III. The concessioner is good, the boat is accommodating as is the crew. It does take 2 1/2 hours to travel to and from the park so it is a long day, but well worth it. They concessioner serves breakfast and lunch, which is included as well as the entry fee to the park. However if you have a national park pass just let the teller know when you check in and you will get the amount refunded. Fort Jefferson was amazing, it has not been modernized so it was really interesting to see it in its natural state after all these years. There are hides tours offered. Outside the fort is a most that you can walk around the fort for beautiful views and to see sea life. There are two beaches you can snorkel from the north and the south. During our snorkel we saw a stingray, coral, sea grass, barracuda, and various other fishes. Really a great park and great time. ","July 24, 2016",Loved it!,121,Texas,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We have been to Key West many times and had always talked about wanting to see the Dry Tortugas. This year we finally bit the bullet and went. At $175 per person, and taking a full day from our 4-day vacation, this was no small consideration. Let me just say - this is one of the BEST things we've EVER done!The ride out on the Yankee Freedom Ferry was nice. It got a little choppy, but you are going through some pretty deep waters. WOW! The water out around Fort Jefferson Dry Tortugas National Park are spectacular! You keep checking your sunglasses to see if they are tinting the water, but they are not. I have never seen water in this many shades of blues and greens. It really is one of the most beautiful sites!We snorkeled around the wall and pilings and got to see some pretty cool sea life. We also spend some time just chilling out with beverages (which we brought in a cooler) in the super-clear water right on the white sand beach. And we also walked all around and self-toured the fort. There's some pretty amazing history and architecture to see and read about. The views from up on the fort were even more breathtaking.We were there a little over 4 hours and although I could have stayed for days, it was ample time to take it all in. Even though the ride back was considerably choppier, I cannot wait to go back and do it all over again!","July 23, 2016",Absolutely Spectacular!,11,"Palm Harbor, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I chose (OK, OK... my WIFE chose!) the Grand Freedom Yankee Dry Tortugas Ferry... and it was phenomenal. I am a grouch, but these folk overcame that with a lovely boat tour out and back, a lunch provided that was actually well-worth it and as much assistance or touring guidance as anyone could want. The ferry skipper went above and beyond to extend hospitality and assistance with a special request made. Best part of the entire Florida Keys motor tour.","July 23, 2016","Get there....

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I have to say this was my favorite day of the entire trip. We took the ferry Yankee Freedom over to the National park. It was a full day trip and the cost included the boat trip, breakfast, lunch, a tour of the fort and a day of snorkeling. I was not prepared for the beautiful waters surrounding this National Park. The snorkeling around the park was great in calm turquoise waters we saw all kinds of colored fishes, sea sponges, corals etc. best snorkeling was around the walls of the fort. A definite must see if in Key West","July 23, 2016",Best day ever,1,"Lodi, New Jersey",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Ferry from Key West. They advertise that they only carry 150 passengers but our trip had 175, so it was quite crowded. Includes breakfast (average) and lunch (better than breakfast). The 2 1/2 hour trip each way is boring with nothing to see but water, but once at the park it was very interesting. You can walk around on your own, take a guided tour, snorkel, fish, and camp.","July 22, 2016",Quite crowded on the ferry but still a good day trip,93,"Atlanta, Georgia",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"There are two ways to get to the Dry Tortugas, ferry or seaplane. Neither way is cheap, but it's worth the expense. We took the seaplane. The island is small and Fort Jefferson takes up 95% of it. You can tour the fort. It's mostly empty. There's a small visitor's center with a video and some information. There was no tour during the time we were there, but a park ranger answered our questions and gave all kinds of information. We also snorkled and had good luck seeing all kinds of fish and even a stingray. The timing of our flight had us arriving just as the ferry was leaving. That left the island for the 10 of us, plus the few people who were camping. The island was quiet, and peaceful, and clean. There are ""permanent"" port-a-potties which were also clean. I don't know how it would be with 200 people all at once. We were on the island for about 3 hours, which gave time for a walk through the fort and snorkle time. Fort Jefferson is a National Park so don't forget to get a stamp for your National Park passbook!","July 22, 2016","By Boat Or By Plane, It's Worth The Trip",91,Chicago Burb,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We have been waiting years to save up to make this trip and it was worth all of the time and money. I only wish we had been able to stay longer and camp, we only had time for the day trip. Took the ferry out and enjoyed snorkeling, exploring the fort (make sure you go up to the roof), and even though it was the ""off"" season for birding there were still sooty terns nesting and frigates all around. A truly special park worth the cost and extra time to get out there.","July 22, 2016",Worth It.,17,"Davenport, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our family of 4 camped here on July 11-13th and had a wonderful experience. We had decided for the price you pay to go for a day visit, we would rather make the most of it and stay a few nights. We remarked more than once that the day trippers were missing out on some of the best the island offered by being there only a few hours. We took advice from other campers that were invaluable leading up to our stay. When we first arrived, we found our spot but did not set up. The advice was to wait until much later and they were spot on. Thankfully, someone who was a seasoned camper here was leaving the day we arrived and offered us his spot. This proved to be the best spot as it go the most wind. When we set up we left the rain fly off (as most of the campers did) and this also gave us a much more comfortable sleep. Added bonus is that I could see the stars above me through the rain fly. We packed everything in hard cases incase of rats. We had mixed reviews on whether or not they were there but we can confirm we did see some. The Captain provides you with a huge trash bag and we just kept that in our tote at night. No problems with rats at our site. I mainly saw them by the bathrooms for campers. While the boat is docked you are free to use their heads. When people say the ground moves at night, they are not lying. Hermit crabs everywhere! This just made it exciting for our boys. The island itself is so peaceful once the boat leaves dock. We didn't have many campers and it felt as though you were by yourself. The only time we really saw anyone else was at sunset when everyone went to either the moat or the top of the Fort to watch. We fished off the docks the first night thanks to the rangers help. That was a fun experience. There is a pesky barracuda who kept trying to steal our fish. We had 3-4 Goliath Groupers also off dock that appreciated the heads of the fish we caught. They were very large in size and seemed to come out after the boat left. The mornings are a great time to get some swim time and snorkeling in before everyone arrives as are the evenings. Most of the fish seemed to go into hiding as the seaplanes and boat arrived. We were told this is because it stirs up the water around the pilings were you are apt to find the most colorful fish. You will see tons of conch also. The moat is beautiful to walk around as the water is so clear you are able to see fish and coral with snorkeling. The water itself is crystal clear all around. We did have refugees land both nights we were there but they were taken quickly by the rangers to be taken care of. We did not walk the fort until our second night there. First night we spent relaxing and only entered the fort to see sunset. After the boat left the second night we went into explore and do self tour. With camping there is no rush. We also laid on the moat to watch the stars at night (least hermit crab invested place at night). We saw a nurse shark in the moat, but no sign of the crocodile. We suspect he is not dumb and was on the island where the birds were mating. Snorkeling was ok, not the best I have seen but as I said earlier it is better before or after boats/ seaplanes leave. The North side was much better for snorkeling as far as seeing different species of fish and coral. Don't stop at end of wall, keep going until you get to the dock ruins.Toilets were clean at least the women's were. No harsh smell either. The rangers are great and informative. We really enjoyed talking to them and the workers in the store. Anyone who has snorkeled before knows not to step on coral, unfortunately we saw a lot of this happening. It was very disheartening to see. We had campers on the island that approached a man who was standing on coral and they nicely tried to explain it was not good. The man and his child responded that they weren't touching the coral only their fins were. Please if you snorkel, understand that any touch will kill the coral. I also saw a family that had two very young children trying to snorkel around the moat wall. This is hard even for me as an adult as you get tired. The children were struggling and visibly having a hard time. They kept trying to stand. My advice, they do offer a sort of vest on the boat for snorkelers. Use it, you can blow it up and it help holds you above water better. If not for yourself than at least for the kids. They tire easily. Tips for staying--We froze water before going and it held us through our camping experience. Next time though, we will take one of those shower systems for camping as days of being in the sand and salt water can make you feel a little grimy (says my husband).- We did not go with bug spray as we read there were no worries for this. Bring bug spray, just incase. We did have little bugs and a few bites. It could be different with the seasons.-We did see rats and we had heard they were in other sites. Not an infestation but yes they are there. Bring hard cases and don't leave food or wrappers out. Also, we had birds who liked to visit our campsite while eating or cooking. - There is shade near beach if you can grab it before boat docks. Otherwise bring an umbrella.-We brought more water than food and it worked for us. We went very basic, mainly dry foods and one saucepan for beans or soup. We have two teenage boys and they did not go hungry. if all else fails, the boat docks daily were you can buy food or ice.-You may bring Kayaks with to go visit a neighboring island where the snorkel is suppose to be fantastic. We tried this and were told they only allow 5 kayaks and the boat was filled the day we were going. Once we were on the boat we found there were no kayaks going. Upon arriving we saw only on tent with 2 kayaks. That was very disappointing. I would suggest keep calling to see if anyone canceled up close to when you are due to leave if you want to bring them and were told no. I am willing to answer any questions you have as to staying on the island. We will be coming back as it was a grand experience and something normally not heard of. You will see all shades of blue water and experience a wonderful calm if you can bring yourself to stay. Otherwise, if you take a day trip try to make the most of the few hours you have there. It might not seem like there is a lot to do but I hear most people regret not staying.","July 22, 2016",Camping on Dry Tortugas,68,Pennsylvania,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is a tiny spit of land, 70 miles off the tip of Key Largo. What few people realize is that Fort Jefferson is one of the largest forts of its era, designed to protect one of the key shipping lanes for early America, and that each of its 16-million bricks (along with everything else) was shipped in, boat-by-boat, from the mainland. The scale of the undertaking here is truly amazing, and any history buff will have more than enough to occupy half a day.Surrounding the island (Garden Key), is one of the best remaining coral heads in this part of the keys. Most of the great diving/snorkeling in the lower keys has been ruined or damaged by major storms or human activity -- and, in truth, Garden Key is no exception. However, compared to the snorkeling off of Key West, it offers an enormous bounty of beautiful corals and aquatic life.The biggest issue with Dry Tortugas is getting there! Anyone without a private boat has only two options: A ridiculously expensive boat ride on the Yankee Freedom (national park concession operator), or an even more ridiculously expensive Seaplane ride. The boat has the advantage of toilets and all of the amenities you need for a day on the island, both in and out of the water, but the steep price is still cringe-worthy compared to the cost of virtually any other activity in the keys.Nonetheless, if you're willing to go all-in on a day where not very many tourists ever go, Dry Tortugas is a surprisingly awesome National Parks site, hidden out beyond the reach of the highways of South Florida.

It was a 2 1/4 pleasant and smooth ride out to Fort Jefferson.

On arrival, we grabbed a picnic table to store our belongings, grabbed our scuba gear ( we brought our own and the ferry furnishes gear without additional charge) and headed for one of the two beaches. We snorkels for about an hour and saw angelfish, a barracuda, tangs, fan coral, brain viral and a host of other sea life in less that 5 feet of water.Afterward we rinsed off on he boat's rear deck and then changed into dry clothing in the pier bathhouse( changing room) . Lunch was much more exciting with cold cuts and snacks with soft drinks.There was always water available on the pier and the boat.

It was bordered by the fort's moat wall, which has developed into beautifully interesting coral growths. We saw numerous varieties of colorful tropical fish and schools of hundreds of tiny silver fish -amazing! We did run into a barracuda that gave us a scare but really didn't bother us.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Relaxing boat ride on the Yankee Freedom to this remarkable place. Walking thru Fort Jefferson felt like taking a trip back in time far away from the ""real"" world.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was a really fantastic day trip. We took the ferry (Yankee Freedom) out to Dry Tortugas & Fort Jefferson. It's about 2.5 hours each way on the boat, so bring a good book. Breakfast & lunch were provided and there was more than enough food to fill us up. Also, on the trip back they had snacks and beverages (adult or otherwise) to purchase.This really is a must see. The tour of Fort Jefferson was extremely informative and very interesting. If you're going to buy souvenirs from the gift shop at the Fort, do so early. They closed the store before we got back from snorkeling and I wasn't able to pick up a postcard. But the opportunity to snorkel was fantastic. And snorkel gear is provided if you don't have your own. We brought masks and snorkels, but used the flippers provided. Also, the water out here is cooler than the beaches in the Keys. So it was a much more enjoyable swim.","July 11, 2016",Snorkeling & Sight-seeing,36,Tennessee,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,This is a must-see if you're in Key West. It's a little piece of paradise.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This review includes a review of the Yankee Freedom boat trip. Booked the boat as it gave us longer on the island and were really glad we did. It's an early start to the day as you need to board about 7.30am but we managed to get seats inside. Breakfast was simple - meat, cheese, bagels, fruit, cereal - but more than sufficient. The trip out took about 2.5 hours.The guided tours of the fort looked like they were going to be very crowded so we opted to go it alone and were glad we did as it meant our timing worked well. We started by walking around the moat wall and then into the fort itself. This meant that we beat the tour and could explore in peace. Also we finished before the tour and therefore beat the rush for lunch. Lunch was 'make your own sandwich' affair with plenty of soft drinks to choose from.After lunch we collected our snorkelling gear and headed for the beach. Good quality masks and flippers and the snorkelling was really interesting. Lots of fish and interesting corals to see.Good changing facilities on the island and freshwater showers on the boat so a comfortable journey back.","July 10, 2016",One of the highlights of our trip,176,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"by far one of the best experiences of my life. we took a seaplane to the park. it allowed us to get aerial views. 2 hours is not near enough time, though, to explore this park. i cannot wait to go back and camp. the snorkeling is beautiful! the fort is full of history. i'm dying to go back to see the birds, too. just fantastic!","July 9, 2016",amazingly beautiful,3,"Douglasville, Georgia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We LOVE visiting the National Parks and have over 100 stamps in our NPS book. We wanted to go to Dry Tortugas many years ago during a trip to Fort Lauderdale and never made it. We were in Key West celebrating our 20th Anniversary and went this time. We took the boat out and enjoyed the ride and beautiful views. Dry Tortugas surpassed my expectations!! We took the boat led longer tour of the fort and learned many new things. The tour seemed shorter than 40 minutes and I couldn't stop taking pictures, the fort itself is really interesting and the outside views are spectacular. The day was a little windy which I guess is unique for Dry Tortugas, but, felt so refreshing after the heat in Key West. Because of the wind the snorkeling was a little choppy. However, we went near one of the older docks and if we were patient we saw many pretty fish. Overall, if you're in Key West or close and you have the time, definitely consider a trip here!","July 9, 2016",Amazing day...highly recommend!,27,"York, Pennsylvania",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited here in June 2016(me & my husband),what a great day out.We booked to go on Yankee Freeedom ,the official ferry of the Dry Tortugas,it's a bit pricey at £120 pp,but worth every penny we thought.It took 2 1/2 hours each way as it is a 70 mile trip from Key West.The ferry is very comfortable ,when you get on at 7.30 in the morning they have a buffet breakfast ready for you,there are hot and cold drinks as well.While at the fort you can get on and off the boat as often as you want,they serve a very good lunch buffet,all very good quality food and drink.The fort is a great experience you can walk inside and out and all round the roof /ramparts ,the views are great.When you have done that you can swim.. and snorkel.The island is also a bird sanctuary so you can see lots of birds flying about.We enjoyed everything about this trip,the boat trip was very relaxing and the island an experience,it was 5,o, clock when back,all you need to take is money for a beer ,towels and sun lotion.There are 2 large car parks 2 minutes from the ferry terminal.","July 9, 2016",Fantastic day out.,19,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,This was the best part of our trip to key west. We went snorkeling while we were at the fort. It was absolutely amazing. There were all kinds of fish in huge schools and you could swim right through the middle of them. We saw all different colors of fish. We saw barracuda and stingrays.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This review also includes the Yankee Freedom III since it's a big part of the trip. We went with our two kids ages 10 and 13. We checked in very early and waited in an air conditioned area until boarding time. Our only complaint is that they don't board based on your passenger ticket number. People just started lining up and we ended about 2/3 of the way back in line. We were still able to get good seating on the first level. There are two levels - the main level has indoor, air conditioned seating with tables and is where the food is served. The second level has a smaller indoor seating area and outdoor seats. The 2.5 catamaran ride went by quickly. We had a smooth seas day with hot, but clear weather. People napped, relaxed, or watched the ocean from the bow area outside. Breakfast is served a few minutes after you board. We saw a dolphin, sea turtles, and flying fish. It was a great ride. The catamaran even got buzzed by a Navy fighter jet. Ft. Jefferson was amazing. It is old but the structure and views of the waters are stunning. The historical story of the island is interesting and worth at least the 25 minute briefing given by a crew member if you don't want to opt for the 60 minute tour. There's changing rooms on the island right at docks. They ask people to change there and not tie up the ship's bathrooms. You can't leave your bags on the boat but people left bags on picnic tables that are everywhere and there were no issues with anything being stolen.  It was shady in the fort and a gives a little break from the sun. There's not much shade otherwise. There are two beaches - the waters were clear, blue, and warm. Snorkeling gear is also available but we didn't snorkel. Lunch was a decent selection of build-your-own sandwiches and sides. Water and soda are provided. There's a cash bar on the return trip. You get about 4.5 hours on the island. How you spend that time is up to you. Our kids wanted to swim so we didn't see as much of the fort as we wanted. We wish we could've stayed longer and would go back again. Also, we saw a lot of seaplanes come and go. It didn't seem they stayed on the island as long as the boat.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We found this day trip on the 4th of July to be exceptional in all respects. The Yankee Freedom National Park ferry itself was clean, comfortable, well-equipped and well-staffed. The ferry ride, which is around 2 hours each way, was pleasant and we enjoyed the sea air and ocean views. We saw a sea turtle surface and flying fish. During our trip out to Garden Key, the ferry staff provided an excellent abbreviated history of Key West, its various industries, the surrounding islands composing the Florida Keys, the Dry Tortugas and Fort Jefferson. There were 4 bathrooms and 3 open air fresh water showers on the ferry for rinsing off after snorkeling and swimming in the ocean waters surrounding Fort Jefferson at Garden Key. We were pleasantly surprised by the continental breakfast and lunch served on board the ferry. We found everything we selected to be quite good despite our initial concerns given that our dining preferences favor farm to table. Snorkeling equipment was provided shortly after the ferry landed at Garden Key. Walking inside and around Fort Jefferson was a pleasurable and educational experience especially after learning about its history during the ferry ride. We were fortunate as the waters in the moat and surrounding the fort were relatively clear so we had a good view of coral, shells, fish and other marine life. We also saw some interesting birds on Garden Key. We were told there are two permissible swimming/snorkeling areas around Garden Key. We selected the South Beach which was sandy and provided a good swimming experience, though coral reef viewing seemed minimal. We apparently missed the more abundant coral reef that is closer to the remains of the old dock and the North Beach. We also had a chance to see the lone island crocodile swimming in the waters of the moat. It is worth noting that some visitors camp out overnight on Garden Key. The National Park Service seems focused on the preservation and protection of the Dry Tortugas which was most welcome to us.","July 8, 2016",This day trip is a winner!,18,"atlanta, georgia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We only spent a few days in Key West and were considering our excursion options. The sea plane to the Dry Tortugas National Park was a great choice. The sea plane ride was so fun. Every seat has a window view and you are literally looking out the window the whole way there. You can see Sea Turtels, sharks etc the entire trip down. The Park is a good mix of history and relaxation. We walked through Fort Jefferson and spent a good amount of our time snorkeling. We saw great colorful sea life, many small fish and a small sting ray. We saw others on the island who arrived by Ferry, but I would do the Sea Plane again in a minute.

Dry Tortugas National Park,I cannot even begin to describe the beauty of this national park. The snorkeling is incredible. So many different varieties of coral and fish!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is by far one of the best excursions my husband and I have ever been on and we've done a lot of them over the years. One thing of note....if you plan to go....make a reservation. We waited until 2 weeks before our trip and everything was sold out except the day before we were scheduled to leave Key West. Luckily they had room for our group of 4. This trip was very well organized by the Yankee Freedom III. The check in was quick and efficient and the boat was amazing (clean, well kept, and plenty of room). We sat inside the cabin for a while as it was air conditioned, but then went outside to stand on the bow of the boat for a beautiful view of the turquoise waters. Its fairly shallow so we saw sea turtles, dolphins chasing us in the boat's wake and plenty of flying fish. The staff and crew were wonderful. Very engaging and informative. They actually walked around to ask if we had any questions. How great is that! We were served a nice continental breakfast with plenty of food and all day coffee and water. The trip is 2 1/2 hrs to the Dry Tortugas but very relaxing. Once there we snorkeled around the fort on our own and saw a ray, small shark, lots of beautiful fish and coral and a few sea turtles. After snorkeling we were treated to a cool fresh water rinse. We went back on the boat for a wonderful lunch (yellow fin tuna salad was my favorite) and then went for a walk around the fort which was very interesting. There is a guided tour but we went on our own. This was a full day adventure. Tropical drinks were served (a small charge for these) once the boat was on its way back to Key West and it was time to relax, listen to some music and take a nap. This is by far one of the best trips we have taken and I highly recommend it.","July 6, 2016",A Must Do Experience!,12,"Lake Mary, United States",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a day trip out to Ft. Jefferson and it was an absolute blast! We saw dolphins along the way and were able to snorkel at the park and see lots of fish!

If you have time to, I would definitely stay the night (or multiple), it is our one regret not staying and just making a day out of it.","July 5, 2016",Lots of fun!,40,Iowa,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I particularly enjoyed the fort. I like to see historical places. We did not use the beaches. There are two. One on each end of the fort from which folks could swim. Snorkeling gear was provided for those who wished to do so. There is also a moat wall surrounding the fort that is accessible. It was a nice walk around to be able to see fish on both sides of the wall. The boat ride there and back were also very enjoyable. We are vegetarian and I was concerned that the food would not be appropriate. However, we definitely did NOT go hungry. I would like to go again and relax on the little beaches or in the shade.","July 4, 2016",Enjoyable adventure,13,"Okmulgee, Oklahoma",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Just about everything about this tour was outstanding. Check-in at Key West was fast and friendly.....the boat that carried us was comfortable and clean.....the crew were very accommodating and very informative......breakfast was adequate.........scenery enroute is magnificent.........arrival at Fort Jefferson was very orderly and well handled by the crew.....the one hour tour that we took of the fort was among the best tours of this type ever and if I could afford it iwould have bought the guide, Ryzee. Charming and amusing young college guy who delivered a thorough explanation of the history of the fort and sounded as if he really enjoyed telling the story....no monotone tour guy he. Lunch on board - again adequate...followed by an hour or so of outstanding snorkeling in clear Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean blue waters. If you visit Key West and pass on this trip you've missed the best part of being there. Expensive but worth every last cent.","July 4, 2016",thoroughly memorable,28,"Delray Beach, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was my first time in the Florida Keys and of everything this is the one place I wish I had more time to spend. We took the Yankee Freedom II ship out of Key West. It was around 2.5 hours each way. The ship had two levels. Downstairs has an air-conditioned indoor space, and the bow of the boat that plenty of people can stand on to see sea turtles and fish off the sides. The upstairs has a smaller air-conditioned area and an outdoor area for passengers. My only advice is while it is wonderful being outside on the trip out coming back everyone will be sunburned no matter your precautions and the air conditioned spaces fill quickly. The ship did have four bathrooms (only bathrooms on island), 2 freshwater showers, and did offer breakfast and lunch complimentary. They also had a small gift shop downstairs. The actual island was both bigger and smaller than expected. The water was so crystal clear whether the water was 10 or 30 feet deep you could easily see the bottom. Snorkeling masks and flippers are provided with the cost of taking the ship, and the snorkeling was phenomenal!!! You can snorkel all the way around the fort but not the entire island. The moat is also off limits and had little jellyfish floating in it. The coral was alive and so vibrant. **A word of caution: it is VERY easy to burn even with lots of sunscreen** The water was about 80-85degrees and is was around 95degrees outside and crystal clear. The ship does offer unlimited water for its passengers also during the day.The actual fort is in amazingly good shape and you can crawl around on all three levels to your heart’s desire. While the third floor is a lot of steps the view is well worth it. You can see everything from the top. However, the floors are not even anywhere in the fort so make sure you are of stable footing while touring. They did offer a sit down history lesson as well as a tour of the fort which I did not partake in. Like all national parks they had a visitor’s center and gift shop open for the public. We did not camp but it is available for all patrons. The tents are pitched right by the water and no showers or bathroom facilities are available when the ship is not in dock. They do however have a changing room (men’s and women’s) available for everyone.","July 4, 2016",Little Piece of Heaven,3,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom III from Key West to Dry Tortugas. We had a great time. While the trip out and back is 2.5 hours each way, we planned for this to happen on our last full day of vacation. It allowed us to just relax each way, daydream as we looked out over the water and read about the area's history.Once we arrived, we had decided to go on the 1+ hour tour of the fort with ship's mate Jeff. We feel we lucked out in making this decision. His knowledge and delivery made us appreciate where we were and how it became what it is today. Before we knew it, our tour was complete; off to snorkeling.My wife had a great time. My snorkel time was cut short due to my mustache and beard; it caused my mask to fill with sea water after a couple minutes (if you have a mustache and don't mind shaving, do so, you'll enjoy the snorkeling more that way).On the way back, we enjoyed discussing what we had seen, what we liked and what was most impressive.Regarding the food on the ferry...Breakfast and lunch were great. I had seen a few reviews regarding the food as less than good. Don't believe those reviews. If you take into account the logistics of feeding 150+ people breakfast and lunch, you'll better appreciate the fantastic job they did with both meals.If you can set aside a day, then this is a trip you should take if you're spending a few days in Key West.","July 4, 2016",Dry Tortugas/Fort Jefferson,5,"Copley, Ohio",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"There's so much history and beauty on this trip. The 2 hr ferry ride isn't the most enjoyable but we just chatted and made friends on the ferry so the time went quickly. We got off the boat and immediately did a self-guided tour with the downloaded PDF they recommend. We then had lunch on the boat, changed to our swimsuits and headed to the South Beach. We did a small amount of snorkeling where we saw LARGE tarpon and several schools of beautiful fish. We then resorted to the little beach area. I would recommend aqua shoes if you have sensitive feet. The beach and ""sand"" was made of coral 'chunks' and my feet were on FIRE. Looking back we should have brought beach chairs to lounge in. The water was beautiful and in case you were wondering, NO sightings of the saltwater crocodile. Apparently he likes to hide on the other islands while the ferry is in dock. It was HOT so I was glad we had packed a few gatorades and water bottles. Definitely do not forget your sunscreen. Wear a sun shirt if you have to. Bring umbrellas, chairs. It was a great trip and we're likely going to camp out the next time we go. ","June 30, 2016",Interesting trip,4,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This historic fort is a couple of hour boat ride to the middle of nowhere. The place and the history was fascinating. You could spend your time wandering the fort and reading all of the plaques. You could also take a tour. We started on the tour, and then went out on our own. We did not see everything the fort had to offer. We spent our remaining time in the water. The water surrounding the fort was a beautiful clear blue. Along the moat wall was a number of sea creatures. It was a nice snorkeling spot. I would recommend this trip to history buffs and water lovers!

You should just plan a day just for this trip and then make plans for other activities after 8 pm if you still have the energy. We took the Yankee Freedom ferry and they include breakfast and lunch. Dry Tortugas to me is basically a Caribbean island without a resort. It has amazing clear blue water and there is a spooky fort to walk around in.

There were two different tours of the fort offered- a 20 minute and 1 1/2 hour version. We took the short one due to limited time at the site. It was very interesting and informative. The employee that gave the talk obviously loves the park and his job and that really makes it much more enjoyable for visitors. There is plenty of time (depending on which tour you chose) to snorkel.

The boarding process was easy and the crew member that gave the instructions was great. Once on board, we were given a nice continental breakfast along with coffee and tea. The had fruit and bagels which were delicious. It took us a little over 2 hours to get to Fort Jefferson. We had some commentary along the way which was very interesting. You could sit outside on the top deck or stand on the upper front deck outside. There was also inside seating with AC. From the deck we saw lots of fish jumping, flying fish and sea turtles so it was an interesting ride....also saw other islands and the Mel Fisher treasure hunting boat along the way. Once at Fort Jefferson, we were given instructions for the day and also given an option of a 20 minute or 1.5 hour talk about the fort. We opted for the shorter tour as we wanted to get in the water and start snorkeling. The tour guide was enthusiastic in his presentation and we really enjoyed his talk.....learned a lot about the fort. Then we went back to the boat for lunch---you could either eat aboard or take your food off the boat. We opted to eat in the AC as it was pretty hot out. We had a nice buffet with cold cuts, breads, sandwich fixings, chips, humus, fruit and cookies. The also had sodas and bottled water available. We enjoyed the lunch and had plenty to eat. Then we were off for our snorkeling. We started on the south side and went out to to the buoy border and then went back and snorkeled along the wall and over the the north coaling docks. I saw a large tarpon and there were tropical fish and coral heads but I have to say it wasn't the best snorkeling I've ever done...It was still enjoyable enough though and it was nice that it wasn't crowded. There were fresh water showers to rinse off the salt water on the deck of the boat and there were changing rooms on the dock. We had brought clothes to change into so we wouldn't have to sit in our wet bathing suits on the trip back. We left the island at 2:45 and got back to Key West around 5:15. We all really enjoyed the trip and thought the Yankee Freedom Crew did a great job and they explain why the would build a fort like that 70 miles out in the ocean in case you're wondering!!","June 27, 2016",Amazing!!,196,orlando,5

Once there you can see and explore the fort. The crew will give you a tour and they are very knowledgeable about the history of the island. Fascinating stuff. There is also great snorkeling.

This place is incredible from the fort to the aqua blue waters. We took the Yankee Freedom ride out to the park and everyone on board made the 2 1/2 hour trip enjoyable. We did a quick tour of the fort, walked the moat wall and the fort and spent the rest of our time snorkeling. I believe we could have spent an entire day just walking around the Fort itself but with limited time we wanted to get everything in we could. The water along the island has great clear blue water with a multitude of fish and other sea life that make it a perfect snorkeling spot. Camping is available on the island and if we ever return I think we would do this just to spend more time on the island.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I booked passage on Yankee Freedom III to go out to the Dry Tortugas for the day. We had a picture perfect day and the seas were unbelievably calm. Suggestions: make sure you have sun protection (rash guards, sunblock and REAPPLY). You are out on the island for about 4.5 hours. We just wanted to snorkel so we did a super quick self-guided tour of the fort (if you are into history and want some shade, the guided tour is included). Decide what you want to do with your limited time. We decided to snorkel and found the best snorkeling along both old coal docks. Coral has colonized up and down the metal support beams (beautiful) and we saw quite a few fish. We did not have time to make it out to the coral heads between the south and north beach areas. The ferry was clean and comfortable with spot narration along the way. Continental breakfast and a sandwich bar for lunch are included. A BIG hint, don't be slow getting back on the boat to head home. The AC seats on both the lower and upper deck go fast. There is only one row of seats on outside top deck that stays in the shade the entire way back. It is a hot and muggy ride back if you end up on the top deck in the sun (it's about 2-2.5 hours back). Again, make sure at least someone in your party gets and indoor or shade seat (and also make sure that you aren't storing your stuff on seats so that other people will be forced to sit in the sun for the ride back). There are drinks available fairly cheaply on the ride back (like $1 for a soda). This is a great trip (staying overnight to camp would be amazing I'd guess).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"After 15 years of living on this rock (Key West), I finally got to go camping at the Dry Tortugas. It was fantastic! After the boat and seaplane left, I stood there savoring the solitude and my mind wondered about those that lived here in the past and how they managed with no readily available water. This made me grateful for having the ability to bring gallons of fresh water - a thing many of us take for granted. The sunsets are out of this world, the moon & stars are magical and the nightly stroll around the mote eerily exciting with only a flashlight in hand. I also really enjoyed the quiet walk down the beach which extends over to Bush Key. We also took our kayaks out and paddled over to Long Key. You can't get out and walk on Long Key because it's a preserve for birds but it was pretty neat getting close.","June 20, 2016",Camping Amazing! Nothing Like It!!!,149,"Key West, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Fort was fascinating but reminds me of the phrase 'fighting the last war.' In hindsight it was completely unnecessary to build it. Boat had plenty of room, and we lucked out with calm seas each way. Crew worked very hard to make it a good experience. Breakfast and lunch (included in price) were simple but good. I am 58 with my wife 61, so we kept our snorkeling just off the beach. But we did find a close reef with several types of fish. More experienced snorkelers could go further out. On the way back they open the bar and grill for paid drinks and food; helps the ride back go faster.","June 19, 2016",Interesting history; worth doing,10,"Tomball, Texas",5

On the ride back, they opened their concession and bar ($5-6) for drinks like rum runners, daiquiris etc. Ride back was a bit bumpy but manageable. The weather on our trip was perfect!

The trip is long, it takes all day and is somewhat expensive if you have a family. I think it is still a pretty good value considering you are on the boat for a total of 5 hours. The boat is very nice and is air conditioned which is very nice when it is hot. The price includes the cost of admission to the Fort, breakfast and lunch. If you would like anything on the ride home they have food and drink available for purchase. The park itself is very interesting and holds lots of historic secrets. The architecture is absolutely amazing for the time period it was built and the location on which it is built. Small children will probably get bored.

There were a ton of jelly fish in the water though so if you go in May I would recommend a long sleeved rash guard to keep the jellyfish stings from your chest and arms.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I will start with what we loved. We loved Fort Jefferson. So much history and a pretty cool structure. We loved walking the walkway around the fort, surrounded by the water. Pretty scary being all the way at the top but you must get up there and get a picture with the Gulf of Mexico in the background. The water is crystal clear yet a little cooler (we were there in May). That's really the only thing we liked. We felt the snorkeling wasn't great. We found tons of dead coral (it's the white stuff and often found on the bottom in many pieces). There is a little more activity along the structure (the walking path around Fort Jefferson) so recommend you stick close to that when doing your snorkeling. There's not a lot of places to sit or eat lunch as most tables are reserved for the campers. There is also not a lot of shade so bring lots of sunblock!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Yes, it is 70 miles out to sea, and a 2 plus hour boat rider each way to get there. Yes, the cost for that boat ride is $175 a person and there is pretty much only the ferry or a sea plane available as transportation, unless you own a boat. But, the investment is worth it. This small piece of land is so beautiful, it is indescribable. The water around the park is like none I've ever seen. Besides the fort, the park is also a bird sanctuary. There were thousands of birds in the park during the first week of June. A good pair of binoculars is all you need if you are interested in bird watching. Photography is another great past time. The fort ruins, the grounds, even the moat walk around the fort offers lots of photo opportunities, be it landscape or wildlife. We did not camp, but that is available. The campsite area is very small and I suspect needs to be booked far in advance. With the ferry ride, you only end up with about 3 hours at the park itself. I found myself running out of time and I was just equipped with cameras and binoculars. You can also snorkel around the perimeter of the park. Not my thing, but some people in our group did and said it was ok. I suppose that activity is always hit or miss, although I got a few decent photos of fish in the water just from walking the moat wall, so it seemed like there were fish to see while snorkeling. All in all, I was so happy we decided to take this trip. Photographers and birders will love it. I am both, so I was in my glory.","June 8, 2016",A Bucket List Must,9,NJ,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,My wife and I visited here several years ago and really enjoyed our visit. The fort was really never used as a fort but was used as a prison after the Civil War. It's most famous prisoner was Dr Mudd who may or may not have been involved with Booth and the Lincoln assassination. The fort itself is a wonderful thing to see and was built with thousands of bricks all brought in by ships. Many old cannon are still in place around the walls. Anyone who enjoys history would enjoy a visit here. One thing I would suggest skipping would be the potato salad that was served with the lunch that was provided. I got really sick on the trip back as did several others on the boat and everyone i talked with had eaten the potato salad. Stick to the sandwiches and the potato chips.Be sure to walk around the fort and see the walls and moat from the outside.,"June 1, 2016",Did the boat trip out and back and loved seeing the fort,85,"Bella Vista, Arkansas",5

It also includes snorkel gear at the park as the fort has some great beach area. A self guided tour is the best way to see Ft Jefferson once you get there. AND IT IS HUGE!! But easy to see.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"How did i not know about this National Park?! The views are stunning. The history is amazing. The bird sanctuary is full of birds. So getting there is not simple nor inexpensive. Dry Tortuga National Park is 70 miles west of Key West and only accessible by sea or air. You can the ferry - a 2 1/4 hour trip but for $175pp it includes breakfast and lunch and snorkeling gear. You can take a seaplane which cost more but is only a 40 minute flight from the Key West airport and also includes snorkeling gear and a cooler with water and soft drinks. You can also take a private boat but again - 2 1/4 hrs. to get there at least! We chose the seaplane for times sake and do not regret it at all. The scenery is stunning! - we saw sea turtles, rays, sharks and fish. We saw sunken ships. We saw underwater desert - with sand dunes that were amazing. Everyone gets a window seat and headphones to hear a little of the history and story of what you are seeing. We had a little over 2 hours on the island and since we have snorkeled many times and were not interested in that - that was plenty of time for us!

The history and nature of the island are magnificent and definitely worth the money to visit during your time in Key West. The snorkeling is magnificent. If you prefer the birds in the sky to the fish of the sea, during the migratory times you will not be disappointed. The fort itself is massive and full of interesting history. Things to know before you go:- It's hot. Plan your attire accordingly.- be sure to bring a change of clothes (there are men's and women's changing rooms at the dock)- bring towels, sunscreen and other sun/beach gear- there is no food or drink available for purchase on the island- The bathrooms on the island close when the Yankee Freedom is docked- have sneakers or good walking shoes for roaming the fort as the grounds are uneven","May 26, 2016",Amazing Island,28,"Dallas, Texas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"there is only camping allowed for overnight visit, which i highly recommend. there is a daily ferry that come and goes, but the visit is so brief, for time on the actual island. 4 hours of the day is spent on the ferry, which is nice, on the way there, but rather uneventful. then when you visit the island it is with a cruise ship of other people, and you are hurried the whole time. only so many people are allowed on the walking tour that the odds are not likely you will be permitted, and the beach area is tiny and cramped. but if you spend a night, and watch all the people you came to the island with leave you can find the real beauty of the island. i brought a sea kayak. it must be a sea kayak, and not a recreational use one. it must be approved by the caption for sea use, as you will be in a harbor when docking but in real waters should you choose to paddle. even if you pass on the paddling, this tiny island grows in size once there closer to 20 than 200 people people. you can walk around without running into people, take your time, spread out and hear the silence. the park rangers let you in the park until sunset, at which time they close it for safety precautions which is understandable. there are plently of places on things on which to trip or fall, and you can be 3 flights up, and surrounded by water. the sunset from the 3rd floor is not to be missed, and the camping for a single night is easy. there is no problem with storage capacity and the haul from the boat to the camping sites is very short. reservations required for camping sites in healthy advance, but well worth it for an entirely different, and in my opinion, superior experience.

Bear in mind the you need to wake up VERY early to get there and in total you have maybe 3-4 hours on the island but that time it worths several days somewhere else. Despite the fact the island is tiny there are a lot of things to do for history lovers, snorkelling funs and ornithology nerds. if you never tried snorkelling - this the perfect spot to try it: shallow water and abundant underwater life will definitely make you fun of this activity. Even if you do not have equipment, they will provide you with it. Just one thing - the trip to and from the island it way to long but if you want to save time and have enough money book a jet trip.

The Yankee Freedom is a dual hauled catamaran which provided smooth sailing on our trip out. There was plenty to eat and drink. Food was basic, cold cuts for lunch , but I would not want to eat anything fancier, if the trip out was rough, or hotter temps. Once at Fort Jefferson, we walked alone along the posted self guided trail. We swan in the calm, bathtub temperature ocean. We snorkel along the South coaling docks next to the Camp ground.

The days are spent snorkeling, sitting on the beach watching the tide come and go, tours/exploring Fort Jefferson or taking a nap under a tree inside Fort Jefferson. The evenings are spent watching the sunset from the moat with a good drink, watching the stars and constellations or visiting with the other campers. The night sky is intense, and better than a planetarium. This is our second trip and it was even better than the first one. The staff are all really pleasant, helpful, informative and just plain nice. Ranger Mike was really a fun Ranger, and the rest of the staff were great too.

The big question that visitors have to answer is how much time do they want to spend touring/exploring the fort, snorkeling, and just walking around Garden Key versus how much money do they want to spend to get there. We took the Yankee Freedom III ferry and paid $175 each. The trip took 2.5 hours each way which left us with just over 4 hours on the island. That really wasn't enough time to explore properly. The seaplane option leaves you with over 6 hours of island time, but will set you back over $550 each for a full day.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"An out of the way place that always has people there. You can arrive by boat or take a plane hop to the fort. About a 2 hour boat ride with a tour. You can then visit Fort Jefferson, snorkel the pristine waters there, swim, relax on the beach. Be sure to take plenty of water and sunscreen. The fort has quite an interesting history of course, being the only fort of its' size and remoteness. Definitely worth the cost of a tour with one of the operators out of Key West. ie Yankee Freedom.","May 15, 2016",Well worth the effort to get there.,19,"Dunedin, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a floatplane that only fit about 10 passengers. It took about 2 hours to walk around the island and see everything that there was to be seen. It was a really cool historical site, and it was a great experience because we pretty much had the whole island to ourselves. After seeing the fort, we were ready to leave, as there are no stores or restaurants or really anything else to do on the island. Around that time, the ferry came in. It had lots of people (maybe a couple hundred?). I don't think it would have been as cool an experience with all the other people walking around. Anyway, back on the floatplane we got, and we were back on key west in 30 minutes. A great time.

We toured the fort and decided to start inon the snorkeling due to the fact it started to get dark and rain was imminent. We snorkeled in the 2 spots that were suggested but since it was so overcast we really didn't see much when I was in the changing room my husband yelled there was a school of dolphins I missed it. The ride back was bumpy and the crew suggested we all take Dramamine. We were sitting with a couple and they were very nice and they spoke to us the entire time to keep our mind off the ride back. I think when the weather is forcasted to be bad you should be able to cancel, I wrote that on the comment card that they handed out and I also think for what this trip cost one adult beverage should be complimentary. It is something to see and island out in the middle of nowhere, only do it if its sunny and nice.","May 12, 2016",Not Dry this day very Wet!!,61,"Runnemede, New Jersey",4

Take the tour at 11am (only an hour) to hear all the great stories and history of the fort. Lunch was served on the boat, then we went snorkeling in pristine, blue water off the beautiful north beach. We got back on the boat early to get the far back seats outside, and the bar opened at 2 so we had more fun in the sun on the way back to Key West!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The second most unique place I've been in the world. (the first being Skellig Michael off the coast of Ireland.) This is place is part fairtale part pirate story, part history lesson. It seems like ti shouldn't exist: a tiny carribean ""island"" (more like 100yards of sand that somehow doesn't wash away in a high tide) with a massive fort built on it that extends into the ocean? My wife and I did an overnight, which I HIGHLY recommend. The ferry that brings you out stays docked for a while which is great because it has a bar, food, showers, running water. Once the ferry leaves and its just you and a dozen other campers with the entire island & fort to yourself its truly magical. The snorkeling is the best i've ever experienced. The Sunset we saw there was the best we've ever seen. of all the places we've traveled (multiple european countries, multiple Caribbean countries, multiple asian countries) this place has been by far the most memorable for its awe-inspiring uniqueness, beauty and solitude.","May 11, 2016","Don't second guess it, just go.",4,"Brooklyn, New York",5

The actual fort was interesting to a point, but tour guides would have added a lot of interest for me. The best part of the fort are the incredible views - lots of great picture opportunities when you go up top.The snorkeling was OK at best - it took us awhile to find anything worthwhile. When we did, there were some fish, but nothing amazing. The scenery on the trip out/back was definitely the best part.Bottom line - this is a nice historical spot with awesome views in the middle of nowhere. I think the ""middle of nowhere"" is the biggest attraction. If you like far-flung spots, you'll love this.

Five minutes would have been fine but he spoke over the intercom for at least a half hour.The Fort was great to see - it is huge. Walking the top of the wall gave you a great view of everything.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I have been visiting Key West for several years, and finally decided to go to the Dry Tortugas. It was an excellent choice.The crew of the Yankee Freedom III was absolutely outstanding! Jeff, Michael, and Libbie, in addition to all of the other crew members, were service-oriented, friendly, and helpful. It was obvious that these folks were striving to make sure that everyone on the trip had an enjoyable time.When we arrived at the Dry Tortugas, I opted for a guided tour of Fort Jefferson. Libbie and Jeff, the two tour guides who led my tour, did an outstanding job of explaining not just the structure (itself an amazing structure of bricks, mortar, arches, cannons, and a moat!), but also the stories of the people who had been at Fort Jefferson during the 19th Century. I thought Jeff did an exceptional job of telling the whole story of Dr. Samuel Mudd, convicted as a co-conspirator in the assassination of President Lincoln, and who was sentenced to life in prison at Fort Jefferson. The entire story, as Jeff tells it, is a true story of forgiveness and redemption in the midst of horrible circumstances.The weather on the day I went as almost ideal. There had been a storm in the Keys the day before I went, and there was still, on the morning of my trip, a stiff westerly breeze as we let Key West. We had been cautioned to expect a very rough ride out to the Dry Tortugas, and I had taken the Dramamine that they crew suggested. Nonetheless, as the boat ride progressed, I found myself getting very nauseated. The crew had told us what to do in the event we began to feel seasick, and when a number of the passengers (including myself) became seasick, the crew was right there with motion-sickness bags, words of comfort, and glasses of ginger ale. The crew could not have been more helpful during this very choppy ride.Did I mention the scenery at the Dry Tortugas? In a word - spectacular! Clear, turquoise waters with white sandy beaches.

The breakfast was suitable for a ferry ride (cereal, hard boiled eggs, ham, cheese, coffee and juice). The ferry is a catamanran and has room to walk around, view the ocean from various locations on the boat, bathrooms, a snack bar and inside seating if you prefer. The park itself is fun to explore. You can spend your time at the fort, walking the outside boundaries of the fort/wall, snorkeling, sunbathing or swimming. The trip gives you about 4/12 hours to spend exploring the island. This includes making it back to the boat if you would like to eat lunch (deli meats, cheese, potato salad, chips and soda). You can also do a fort tour which is packed full of information about the fort. All and all it is a full day of being out on the water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Fort Jefferson is unique among our National Parks as it is on an island (key) 70 miles west of Key West, Fl. Transportation to the park is via a high speed catamaran, the Yankee Freedom III. Our ticket at $175 each, provided continental breakfast on the 2 1/2 hour ride to the island, a lunch buffet with beverages while docked, and entertainment from the spirited and well informed tour guides and crew. Your ticket also includes admission to the park and a 40 minute guided tour of the fort. If you choose to snorkel around the island, or beyond the moat walls, snorkel gear is provided at no extra charge.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I visited the Dry Tortugas about 12 years ago and despite the cost for 2 back then I did it for 4 just this past trip APRIL 26. It was WORTH it. You take a nice boat/ferry ride that goes quickly (even though its 2.5 hrs). Breakfast is served on it. It is airconditioned and you are able to sit at tables on the ferry.We eventually left at 8am (you need to be there at 7:15am) and we got there at 10:30.We walked around the fort on the moat to see the fish and look at the very clear water. When we got around it was about time to eat lunch for us (served from 11am-1:30). We ate and then toured the fort. It was nice and historical and there were many photo opps. If we wanted we could have gotten a guided tour at 11 but chose to eat earlier.After the fort we got our snorkeling equipement out (included in ticket). I recommend that you exit the boat, turn right, go to the north beach and then swim around to the right where the dock and pylons are. I was told it was national geographic like there. We went swimming near the wall. When we walked we saw fish, but then later didn't get to see as many. Also if you go to the south beach which is where they recommend, there is a small hole underwater from the moat where a bunch of fish swim in and out of.I would recommend wearing a hat to the dry tortugas and lots of sunscreen. If you get too hot you can go sit on the boat and cool off. I wouldn't recommend bringing babies or toddlers because of the intense heat.The crew is helpful and curteous. (TIP them at the end when you get back getting off the boat).You have to get back to the boat by 2:45 and then it leaves at 3, getting back to KW by 5:30.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"this place was amazing! my b/f and i took the 2 hour catamaran on the Yankee Freedom III with a smooth ride out where i even saw a turtle swimming by which immediately made my day. snorkeling wasnt that great that day due to storms the previous days and the storms that were rolling in that day. it was still cool to see the coral along the moat wall. i didnt go too far out because the water was 69 degrees and that is cold for me (i used to live in South Florida). some people went to the buoys and saw big fish out there. youre not allowed to swim in the moat. the walk around the moat is awesome especially when youre standing there with no one around. Fort Jefferson is amazing too. my b/f and i managed to do all 3 levels and see the ruins in the middle of the fort. we walk quickly so that is most likely how we were able to see everything but there really isnt much time there and the day goes by very quickly. the ride back to key west was quite bumpy but i was fine although i felt it for about 4 more days every once in a while. kinda like when u get off a cruise ship and u feel wavy. thats the best way to explain it. but they sell dramime for $1 on the boat and the tour guide we had, Jeffrey, was pretty insistent on people taking it due to experience. he was a great guy and really cool. i did not take the fort tour w/him so that i could snorkel first and then just read the signs around the fort, although theres only about a handful of these signs. there is a small air conditioned room with a tv showing some videos about marine life and very small museum and store. u can also get some relief from the sun by just going into the fort. it was a bit rainy and breezy the day i went so we just walked inside the fort every time it poured.","April 29, 2016",absolutely awesome,64,"Brooklyn, New York",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Did a half day trip by seaplane, leaving KW at 08:00, arriving back at 12:00. Getting to Tortugas before 09:00, before it was too hit, and when there were very few other folk there was amazing, felt like you had the place to yourself, and it really brought home the desolation of the place. So....what is there to do? Walk the walls, walk the moat, walk inside the walls, the visitor centre, the beach, and of course the snorkelling. Take your own food and drink with you, no facilities there other than changing and toilets. Half a day was not long enough to do everything, but after 10.30 when the visitor boat arrives, the population multiplies several times over, and you no longer feel as alone as you did! Tip... If snorkelling or even just using the beach, place your clothes high up the beach - if a large boat passes, even some distance away, the swell is pretty impressive!!","April 28, 2016","Mega, amazing, beautiful.

We went on a windy day so we hit some 3-4 ft swells. The crew warned us before we headed out and basically recommended everyone take sea sick medicine. We did and we're glad for it as we saw several people toss their free breakfast before making it to the fort. The food on the ferry was better than I expected. Breakfast was better than some hotel continentals. I am gluten free and was able to find enough to fill me. Lunch was also good. I was able to eat everything on the line except the bread. I also liked that for the salads they listed all ingredients so I could be sure they were safe to eat. So since it was windy snorkeling was a bit of a bust for us. Some people had luck seeing cool fish by the pillons but we didn't bother since it was so cloudy. The beach was nice to just hang out. The fort was neat too.

On the way, we stood at the front of the ferry and saw flying fish, sea turtles, and a dolphin.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Absolutely the highlight of our week long Key West Honeymoon. Although a bit pricey, we strongly recommend this excursion. The boat ride was pleasant as the narrators offered a historical synopsis on what islands we were passing on the way. Once on the island, we did the self guided tour through the fort. Truly spectacular and some amazing views. They did offer a narrated tour with guides, but we decided against this because we want to have plenty of time to snorkel. We recommend snorkeling near the old refinery ruins. Again an amazing experience. Overall, the whole day excursion was fantastic. If I can nitpick, the lunch and snacks offered by the ship's staff was less than stellar, and you only have a short amount of time to eat. Basic sandwich stuff with a couple small cokes and bags of potato chips.","April 22, 2016",Amazing blend for history and nature buffs,9,"Exton, Pennsylvania",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a great trip for history buffs and boaters. Unfortunately we went on a clear, sunny, beautiful day, but the seas were extremely rough. The crew was excellent in coaching those who were prone to sea sickness, but the boat trip there and back was very rough being that it is in very open seas. We were pre-warned by 'experienced Caribbean sailors', but couldn't reschedule (wish we could have--you can cancel your trip up to 3pm the day before). Once on the island, the fort is an amazing piece of architecture. A tour is available (by the boat crew).There is a beautiful beach area and snorkeling available, IF the weather is right. Too much wind and it's not good. The trip includes breakfast during the trip and lunch on board (docked) at the fort. I wish the winds would have been calmer (they said summer is better) because I didn't want my experience to be all about the boat ride, but it is half of the time of the trip (2.5 hours there and 2/5 hours back; 5 hours on the island). If you don't like being on a boat, this is not for you. The boat is clean, well maintained, offers food, drinks (alcohol) for a charge AFTER breakfast and lunch. Things to take: dramamine (lots of it!!) and sunscreen with a change of clothes if you're going in the water or riding topside on the boat. there are changing stations on the island, but no restrooms; those are on the boat, which stays at the island. There are also warm showers on the boat. Would have given this an ""excellent"" review except for the boat ride. In our opinion it should have been cancelled (we were told the Coast Guard dictates that). Even the sea planes didn't go that day.","April 21, 2016",Great history experience,10,"Michigan Center, Michigan",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,My wife and I live in Miami so coming to the Keys is easy. We planned this excursion on my birthday and it was an event of a lifetime! The catamaran is as smooth as glass on the water; you get to see dolphins racing the boat. The food and sodas are included in the price so there is nothing else to pay for except mixed drinks.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The boat ride is quite long to get to the park although we knew that before booking the trip. The day started out good on the dock as the man working in the ticket booth was very cordial. From there it went downhill with the exception of a nicely prepared lunch buffet that had something for every diet. The staff on the boat seemed young and unprofessional. A female employee working behind the bar was constantly ""rough-housing"" with the male employees. In between making cocktails, she filled a rubber glove with some sort of cherry syrup, squirting it all over a fellow employee. Personally, I do not want to see this type of juvenile behavior from staff that are also serving food. Everyone was tired on the trip back and unfortunately there were television monitors blaring what sounded like constant screaming (I think it was a Shrek movie). It seemed to parallel the thinking of the staff because there weren't a lot of young children on board. I did not see a single person watching it but rather commenting on the how horrible the noise was. Overall, it was not a positive experience but our dinner at Alonzo's Oyster Bar when we returned helped make the day a good one. On a final note as far as the National Park, I was extremely troubled to see considerable debris floating around the dock. There were plastic forks, knives, drinking straws and various other items. These items present a huge risk to our marine life including sea turtles. We observed a foreign family blatantly throwing trash on the ground while a park ranger stood nearby. It's a national park!!!! There should be stringent rules in place that everyone understands to protect it.","April 21, 2016",Unpleasant experience,81,"Charlotte, North Carolina",1
Dry Tortugas National Park,"It's an all day trip, but one well worth it. You have to get up early to get to the Ferry (and make sure you reserve your tickets in advance, especially during spring break it fills up), they will tell you if they expect rough sees and sell individual portions medication,but we didn't need it, seas were calm enough (still some people who got really sick). Sit outside if it's warm enough and see the blue water, feel the wind and see small islands pass. Once you get to the island: The fort itself is interesting to walk around in, self guided tour that you download before you board tells you more. If you have kids, do the junior ranger program, not only is it a badge that not many people get, but it also gives you a free ice cream sandwich on the boat back. After the fort, get your towel and lie on the beach and do some swimming. Snorkling is relatively basic, not that much to see, but the water is nice.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was billed as an excursion with interesting historical sites and great snorkeling. It was neither. It's a long (2.5 hr.) boat ride to get there from Key West (and another 2.5 hr. to get back) that costs about $170 per person. The fort on the island might be interesting if you've never seen one from that period, but it's pretty similar to other forts from the period. The snorkeling was really poor -- murky water, dead coral and very few fish. (I visited the two top snorkeling locations and snorkeled the entire circumference of the island.)Apparently the island is a stopover place for migrating birds, and there are lots of frigate birds floating overhead. I think the birders on the trip were happy.If you want snorkeling, sign up for a proper snorkeling your with one of the dive shops in Key West.If you're into birding, this may be a good trip for you.If you have time to kill and want to spend 5 hours in transit so you can spend an hour or so exploring an old fort, this is the trip for you.You probably can find better ways to spend your time.","April 20, 2016",Don't waste your time unless you're a birder.,87,"New York City, New York",1

Excellent snorkling with a large variety of fish to see and very close to the beach.

The water and snorkeling was wonderful. The parrot fish were huge. We were well prepared to spend the day on the key and had plenty of food, water and sun screen. We worked hard at covering up and keeping out of the sun, but still managed to get pink in the face due to the reflection off the water. As we were there for about 6 hours, we managed to stay in the water longer wearing wetsuits to keep warm. I was a little too warm in my suit (5mm) but I would rather be too warm than too cold. I was also wearing a hood, gloves and booties. My husband was wearing a 3mm suit, hood and but no booties and he was also on the warm side.

I respect the struggle those before us have lived and I like to visit and appreciate what others have lived. However this place is different. I mean we arrived, toured the fort of about a half hour (guided tours about 1-1/2 hour I think?) and then said, 'Okay, let's snorkel!"" Yep, life was hard back then, well it basically sucked if you were a prisoner (spoiler alert, the fort was also used as a prison) in paradise that's true, but we were in the middle of paradise and I've seen old forts before. So we ate a great lunch then hit the water. Great snorkeling, (I have a full beard I trim tight but wish I would have gotten it better, my mask leaked) pretty decent beaches and oh my the blue water, breeze and sun! The crew on the boat is fantastic too! IF you read a bit before you get there on the website they lay it all out for you. IF you didn't read before you got there they lay it ALL out for you repeatedly, then they repeat that, and a few more times too, Always in easy to understand and light hearted ways. Jeff was the M.C. tour host ya might say, awesome guy. We were going to go last year but the seas were rough. Jeff really went over what the day was going to be like. There was going to be 6 foot swells, so we backed out per his advise. We were so glad we did as the trip this year was freaking awesome! It is a decent ride out and back 2+ hours one way so be prepared. But you are on a decently fast boat in the middle of the most awesome blue water you could want and they have a bar on the way back.....if you are in hurry don't bother going to KW anyhow you missed the point. Oh yea, TIP THE CREW!!! I'm a working class guy with a enough education to make me dangerous, I work hard for my money these guys do too and living as worker in KW is expensive. We tipped the bartender every round and when the three of us left we put $40.00 in their jar too. Oh yea really good breakfast too, really more food than ya need but that's okay. The check in staff is awesome also, just read up a bit before you go. You are investing and entire day of your trip and a decent amount of cash so so up ready to have a good time. The temps were 75-80 all day. I wore swim trunks and flip flops all day and a tank top, my wife who gets cold easy had a light sweat shirt and was fine.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was a great experience! My boyfriend and I came here by ferry and really enjoyed this place! We only had about 5 hours to spend on this island so we took advantage of snorkeling ( that we so so), touring the fort ( amazing), sunbathing and relaxing in the beach! I would recommend bringing your own snorkel gear due to some gear of the goggles being really hard to see through. There is a small gift shop inside the fort that sells very neat postcards and many other trinkets! Enjoy!!","April 1, 2016",So historic!!,8,"Buffalo, New York",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"OK, so we didn't get to see anything amazing while we wree snorkeling, but we still had a great time. The fort itself is amazing, and the views from all parts of the island are incredible. Watching the seaplanes land, seeing the turtles and flying fish in the open water off of the islands, and just exploring the fort and other ruins were worth the trip.","April 1, 2016",Amazing Day Trip,28,"Pilot Mountain, North Carolina",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The ride there and back is longer than a stay. Super expensive for disappointing snorkeling and a fortress where nothing really happened. The tour of the fortress was interesting but not worth $175 per person. It would be an interesting visit if it were 30min away and cost less than $50, but given the distance and expense this was a bad investment. Would have been better to use the time and money to go sailing or stay longer at key west. The Yankee Freedom III and their staff were great, food was good so that was the only highlight of this long trip. This is the only way to get to Dry Tortugas other than paying $400 for airplane, but camping at the island maybe more interesting to have time to explore. Overall not worth it","March 31, 2016",Waste of money and time,138,"Bethesda, Maryland",2

Dry Tortugas National Park,"1. The laminated fish card sold on board was worth it. We wished we had a bungee to punch a hole in it and attach it to the wist. 2. Inspect your flippers and snorkel to make sure there are no cracks. My husband's snorkel kept leaking in his mouth and he is still talking about it. 3. Bring a water bottle and fill it before you go - anything to discourage all the disposable water bottle use that is polluting our oceans and destroying the very thing you are going to see. 4. Bring an underwater camera. We regret it. 5. Make sure you get a confirmation in email from Yankee Freedom III. We did not and ended up going gat 5:00am to get on standby. I would not discourage a reader from going to Dry Tortugas, but I hope to encourage the NPS system to beef up the educational part of it to give the entire national park experience and use it as an opportunity to encourage more environmental awareness.We purposely went to Dry Tortugas because it is part of the National Park system. If you're there for the fort, it does the job. If you are there for the rest of it, which is why it's a national park and not just a monument, it fails. The entire day was interesting since we had never snorkeled before and the day was beautiful. The reefs and fish were beautiful and the water was really great; however, we learned nothing about coral reefs, the ecosystem, or why this was even declared a national park. In fact, we learned far more about what we saw and their importance at the Biscayne National Park Visitor Center. We did not spend much time in the fort since there was not a lot of time. Finally, the Yankee Freedom III does a pretty good job in explaining a lot about the Fort, keeping everyone organized and the food was appropriate. In fact, the organization was really impressive. My only quibble was the use of plastic bottles, styrofoam cups . . . . all the things that other national parks tend to discourage. So, yes, an adventure, but an opportunity wasted by NPS.","March 29, 2016","Not a ""National Park"" experience, but an adventure",23,"Chicago, Illinois",4

Once on the island we looked forward to snorkeling, but we're disappointed with the small number of sightings at the two ""best"" locales.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Four of us visited in early March and had a great time. We took the Seaplane out and had a great flight. The pilot was very informative and pointed out what few sights were available. The landing were very smooth. Once on the Key we made the mistake of starting to listen to one of the Park Rangers. He was very dull talked about things not about the Fort and most of us walked off to tour the Fort on our own because he was so boring and uninformative. The worst Park Ranger I have seen in 15 different National Parks. We did see a crocodile in the moat surrounding the Fort. We also did some snorkeling that wasn't that special. I wish we had taken the morning flight and spent the day on the Key instead of doing a half day.,"March 27, 2016",Not enough time to see everything,36,"Spokane, Washington",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took this trip on the Yankee Freedom III with my whole family ranging from 13 to 82. If you expect a packaged predictable touristy experience, you may be disappointed as you as going to be at the hands of mother nature traveling 70 miles into the Gulf of Mexico to an island with no running water. But if you want a neat adventure to a massive civil war era fort/prison with historical significance situated on an island that is both a bird and sea turtle sanctuary with decent snorkeling, all packaged together with breakfast, lunch, and a 30+ mph catamaran ride through the beautiful waters of the keys, then this is the trip for you. Even cooler is that you can actually have them leave you there and camp for as long as your water, food and sunscreen last. This was on my bucket list and I'm glad I went. I would do it again.","March 27, 2016",Great fun for my whole family,4,"Richmond, Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you love visiting National Parks, then this gem is for you! It is a must see and do in Key West. First, choose how to depart/arrive to the Dry Tortugas National Park and Fort Jefferson either by ferry boat or sea plane. My family decided the ferry boat, Yankee Freedom III. If you are prone to motion sickness or think you are, make sure to purchase Dramamine or Bonine. They sell it prior to departure for $1 a pack. The pack contains 2 orange flavored chew tabs. Check the weather prior to departure because you have a small cancelation window if you choose. The ferry goes rain or shine. Check their website for further information and frequently asked questions or call them on the phone. Our departure was Tuesday 3/22. Check in was from 7am to 7:30am. They leave promptly at 8am. Breakfast and lunch is served aboard the ferry. Admission inside the fort is included in your ferry price. We had to ride through open ocean and two channels. The first channel was no problem but the second was bumpy and people got sick. Everyone in our family took dramamine. As I mentioned before, the roughest time on the ferry was Rebecca's Channel.This channel is closest to the national park. Roller coaster plunges and climbs describe the motion of the ocean. The seas were 4 to 6 feet. The ferry ride was approximately 2 1/2 hours. Everyone was happy when we arrived. For miles, nothing but ocean and then suddenly the national park and fort appears in aqua blue, sea green water. Amazing!This is a wonderful day trip from Key West. If you like camping, you can decide to stay for a few days. NOTE: There are NO BATHROOMS inside Fort Jefferson or at the National Park. There is a gray building which is a changing area but there are NO FACILITIES on the island or the fort. This is a PRIMITIVE site. The ONLY BATHROOM IS ABOARD THE FERRY. They have 4 bathroom stalls. One is handicapped. There are some picnic tables outside the fort. Everything you take in must be taken back out. Take pictures, leave footprints but no trash! Please, pick up after yourselves! There is a visitor center inside the fort grounds. While walking around the island/fort/national park, be aware of the uneven ground. This is why I included primitive in my title description. There are no handrails to hold on to. The ground is uneven in places and the fort is undergoing constant repairs due to weather erosion and decay. Walkways are not smooth and some stairs may be difficult for some people to climb. There are three levels to the fort. We did the first and second because we had a senior and preschooler with us. The third level is narrow to walk in some areas but there are some spectacular views if you decide to go to the top. The ferry service also offers a guided 45 min tour of the fort. The ranger at the fort also has a narrated tour too. If you have children that would like to participate in the junior ranger program, they have it here. We completed the junior ranger booklet and went to the bookstore (visitor center) as stated but the person there said to go look for the ranger. We could not find the ranger and did not get the badge. You can explore the fort on your own and read the plaques as you go. Four hours is more than enough time to visit the island and fort grounds. Most people come here to snorkel. My family did not do it because visibility was very limited. The people that did snorkel said they couldn't see anything in front of them. You can also hang out at the beach too. The beach is powdery and soft. When we were there, lots of dead coral, seashells and sea fans littered the beach area. Remember, you can NOT take anything from the beach or the fort! Just take photos and leave footprints.Interesting history about the fort and the people that occupied it long ago! The ferry ride back to Key West was better going than coming. Hardly anyone got sick. Rebecca's Channel was a rough roller coaster ride but once we got out it was smooth sailing. Even in 4 to 6 foot waves. I would recommend this highly! This is an excellent, day trip get away from Key West. I recommend the yankee freedom ferry too. The staff was friendly. They offered fresh food to eat and were knowledgeable about the area.","March 25, 2016","Unique day trip; Primitive, Pristine National Park; Explorers delight from Key West",132,H,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I had heard that this was a great spot for birding and booked the ferry. The ride was well organized but I was surprised there was not more bird life on the ride out and back. However the island did not disappoint. Although the diversity of birds I found in mid-March was not great, the numbers of magnificent frigatebirds, sooty terns, brown noddies, and masked boobies were impressive and allowed for fine photos with even my 300mm lens For my non-birding husband, the historic fort, snorkeling, and included meals made it a well rounded and enjoyable trip for both of us. The price was not cheap, but the experience was worth it.","March 25, 2016",Destination location was worth it,12,"Riverside, Connecticut",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We decided to save a few and took the ferry over. Its an early start for us and the boat ride was about 2 hours, but it wasn't too bad. They provide BREAKFAST on the ferry and you can be inside or out. When we got there we signed up for a TOUR but it seemed like it didn't matter if you signed up because people just followed the tour guide anyway. The tour was really interesting and definitely recommend it, some interesting facts about all that went wrong with the fort. Then we got back to the boat and had sandwiches for LUNCH, chips, soda, cookies. not 5 star, I really enjoyed it. Next, we got snorkel gear and walked the MOAT PATH. To find the good SNORKEL spots you have to enter on the BEACH and swim all the way around to the pilings, was kinda of scary if you do it alone, but they provide float vests and we brought inflatable noodles from Amazon, so convenient! definitely recommend it. then we headed back to the boat and got drinks on the boat on the ride home, they offer some snacks and drinks for cash. If we went again we would try the seaplane just to experience the views and we know our way around this time to get to the snorkel spots, i don't think you get as much time on the island with the seaplane so I recommend doing a full day there the 1st time to really experience it all in case you never get to go back….but you will want to.","March 24, 2016",Everyone recommended this and they were right,9,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,We took the all day boat trip to the fort/prison to check it out this March. The structure is defently worth the visit. They allow you to pretty much walk and explore on your own but they do offer guided tours during which one can listen to stories concerning the history. Snorkel gear was available for free off the boat and I did take advantage and snorkeled around the area and saw fish around the old dock area. As a note the all day trip is ALL DAY. Breakfast and lunch is served on the boat along with alcoholic beverages on the return trip but being there for hours is almost too much time to tour the fort. I would recommend this flight versus the boat trip but it is way more expensive.,"March 23, 2016",Interesting to explore,13,"Wheelersburg, Ohio",5

Seeing the fort come into view several miles before getting there was really cool. It just pops up out of the gulf, and as you get closer it gets bigger. Exploring the fort was really interesting. Seeing what life was like over a hundred years ago, on an island totally encompassed by the fort. All the food and water had to be shipped in. The fort eventually became a prison, and was the home of Dr. Mudd. The doctor who set the leg of John Wilkes Booth. A very remarkable experience.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Pictures do not do this place justice. It is just so beautiful and unique. A bunch of random info about the experience.... We booked 8 weeks ahead of time for a visit in March, during the heart of the busy Spring Break season, and we almost didn't get to go. All of the days we wanted were sold out, so we had to settle on the one day available during our stay and switch other plans around. BOOK EARLY! We took the ferry and for 2 adults / 2 kids it was $600. We would have loved to do the plane trip but it was too costly for us. The ferry experience was wonderful. We arrived at the dock at 7am and waited for boarding. There is an ATM at the port station and a vending machine but nothing else. I was hoping for some coffee but there is nothing like that at the port station so bring your own. We brought suncreen, towels, wet suits, and some of our own snorkel gear. For a storage fee (not sure how much) you can also bring your own kayak or paddleboard. This is a nice feature for those folks who camp at the Fort overnight. You can camp up to 3 days, and although we weren't camping this time, we hope to do that in the future. The ride over included a breakfast of cereals, yogurts, fruit, bagels / muffins, meats, coffee, juice, and milk. The ride was smooth and the captain actually slowed the boat at one point and circled a pod of dolphins so we could take pictures and ohh and ahh over their beauty. There were probably 12 dolphins in the water, amazing. There are concessions available for purchase on the boat and they take cash or credit cards. Very good prices. $1 for candy bars and little snacks. For drinks they have bottled waters and sodas. After 2pm you can get Sangria $5, beers $4, and a full bar with rum, vodka, whiskey etc. Even frozen drinks! We signed up for the tour at 11am and they have one other tour later in the day. These tours filled up quickly and you had to sign up since only a limited number of folks can go on the tour . The tour takes an hour, very good, very informative. We did the tour, then had lunch. Lunch was chicken salad, potato salad, lunch meats / sandwich fixings, with chips and cookies. Everything was good. After lunch, we put on our wet suits, as the water is about 75 degrees, and snorkeled along the moat walls and the reef. The reef is a short swim away from the moat. Nice snorkel, on the average side, but the setting makes up for any thing missing in the snorkel experience. We saw lots of star fish, urchins, conch, and lots of shallow water fish. Very cool submerged anchors that looked ancient. After our snorkel, we rinsed our gear on the dock (they provide gear or you can bring your own, but they do not have wet suits available) and then we rinsed off in a fresh water shower on the back of the boat. We went back on the fort and visited the gift shop, which is small but has some cute stuff. We bought a Dry Tortugas postcard and then stamped it in the lobby with one of the National Parks Centennial stamps. We were back on board for a 2:45pm departure and a smooth ride home. There are no restrooms at the fort so you use the ferry's restrooms through out the day. The interior cabins of the boat were freezing and we spent our time in there wrapped in our towels. The exterior seating is nice but was too windy for the kids. They sell nice souvenirs on the boat too, including playing cards and tshirts etc. We tipped the crew on our way off the boat, they do a wonderful job. The Fort is so impressive, such a one of a kind structure, that I won't even try to cover how cool it is. Take your time, and climb every level.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"For the last 10 years, we have wanted to do this trip. We finally got around to it and loved every bit of it! The fort was awesome and it's great to see the maintenance that's going on. I love that they kept it as close as possible to how it was not installing hand rails and leveling areas. If you are not the most stable, it might be tough to get around, and there are many safety issues because of this, but that's what we feel makes it great! The history is fantastic and the fort is beautiful! This is a national park and can, of course, use your generous donations to help maintain it. The waters surrounding the fort are spectacular. The visibility was fantastic and the corals beautiful. There are lots of fish and amazing sights! We snorkeled around the wall some and the south dock ruins (there is a map given on the boat telling you about these places). We are avid snorkelers and divers and this was one of our favorite places to go! There were lots of different corals and they were very well established. The grounds are super clean and beautiful! The beach areas are nice and the waters an absolutely amazing color. The views from all over Garden Key were absolutely amazing! The trip is not cheap and it takes a while to get there, but it is definitely worth every penny! You get about 4 1/2 hours on the island which isn't quite enough to do everything. We would have loved to spend more time in the fort AND snorkel. It's enough to explore the fort thoroughly and plenty to snorkel, but getting them both in with lunch was a bit of a crunch.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This all-day adventure was fabulous and as others have commented is worth every penny. At first I thought 4.5 hours on the island might be too long, but I would gladly have had another hour or two. Take your camera as the photo ops are abundant. Binoculars would be great too if you're a birder. Take along a change of clothes and make use of the warm fresh water showers on the Yankee Freedom to rinse off you and your suit and then use the change rooms provided on the dock. Don't forget your sunscreen for your time on the island but you can stay inside the air conditioned lounges on the boat if you want to stay out of the sun during the trip there and back. Yankee Freedom Tour guide Jeff did a great job of informing us about our itinerary, logistics and leading the tour of the history of the fort. The catamaran was clean and well appointed and the food was abundant and fresh. After many days of wind, it finally calmed down and the visibility for snorkelling was great. The best snorkelling on this day was off the North Swimming Beach and along the moat wall on that side. It was calmer there and there was lots of bright coral and fish that you could see just walking along the moat.","March 14, 2016",One of the best days of my 11 month adventure around North America,14,"Ottawa, Canada",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Dry Tortugas National Park lies 70 miles west of Key West, and is reached either by commercial ferry or seaplane. The ferry costs $175 per adult, and is an all day event, checking in at 7am, and returning at 515pm. One way travel time is 2 hours, 15 minutes. The seaplane costs $317 for a half day excursion, with one way travel time running about 40 minutes.The largest attraction on Dry Tortugas is Fort Jefferson, that simply dominates the island. Built in the first half of the 1800’s, it is an imposing and amazing structure. It has an interesting history, including the confinement of Dr. Mudd, the physician that set John Wilkes Boothe’s broken leg after assassinating President Lincoln. The Dry Tortugas also offers snorkeling, camping, and other naturalist pursuits. Being there in January, while comfortable, it seemed a little too cool for water activities.While the seaplane is more expensive than the ferry, the saving of time was well worth it, as was the visit to Dry Tortugas itself.","March 14, 2016",Consider Doing It At Least Once,124,"Lewes, Delaware",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,We enjoyed this outing but it is a big commitment of time. 7-5:30. Much of the time is spent getting to and fro. 3 hours on the island was more than enough. The fort was interesting to explore and the setting is spectacular. The staff on the boat were excellent and they did a good job on serving breakfast and lunch (buffet style). If you are in Key West with a whole day open it is a unique experience that I recommend.We had a rough trip out and there were several of us who became seasick.

It was breezy, snorkeling conditions were not that great and we STILL had a wonderful time. We took an afternoon sea plane to the island and had it almost to ourselves.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The tour was really interesting and kept my attention during the entire walk around the fort. The boat crewman who led the tour was well versed in his factual information about the fort and life their. The over night camping experience seems exciting but a little scary with rats that come out at night. The water was 67 degrees F and way too cold for this Florida couple. People from the North did not seem to mind. I do not get in the water unless it is 80 degrees in the Caribbean. I talked with the park ranger at length who spends 2 weeks there at a time and he really enjoys it.

The staff was wonderful in caring for the weak of stomach although, we quite enjoyed the wind and the waves. Fort Jefferson was a beautiful place to visit. We opted to meander on a self guided tour around the mote and inside the fort. It takes just a couple of hours at the most and the rest of the day is yours to snorkel, or sunbathe on the little beach. Great coral sifting/shelling/beach glass collecting. Many areas of the Fort were closed off due to construction and much of the outlying areas were closed off due to bird nesting. The views are spectacular the water looked amazing but too cold for this Florida couple. Lots of tables to have a quiet picnic.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Yes, it is pricey but a trip to Key West would not be complete without going out to Dry Tortugas National Park. There are two ways to get there, by seaplane or ferry unless you know a rich person with a boat big enough to navigate the 70 miles to the island. Fort Jefferson is the main attraction and it is so worth taking the longer tour of the Fort. It is 90 minutes long and every question is answered. Controlling the cleanliness is important so no plastic water bottles are allowed therefore you should bring a reusable bottle and please do not litter. The moat around the fort is clean and shallow but care should be taken with walking close to the edge. You can snorkel in designated areas and the equipment is included in the fee from the ferry. So worth it. Be sure to get a National Park Passport and stamp your book inside the Visitor Center. A must see.","March 10, 2016",A visit to a National Park is a must,9,"Annandale, Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the morning ferry to the national park. The ferry itself has good accommodations, fresh water showers, and a buffet breakfast and lunch. The park is an old historic fort, on an island of approximately the same size. We went primarily for the snorkeling which turned out to be a bit uninteresting. We were told by the local dive shop not to worry about the water temp, at 68 degrees, because the ferry operators would have wet suits, but just in case we brought our own. As it turned out, the operators only provided snorkels, masks and fins. We turned out to be one of only 2 groups which stayed in the water because of the temperature. The fort and beach were nice, so they didn't loose out except for the water. Around the Island, there is little good coral and not many interesting fish on the reefs around the park when we were there. The park seems to be ringed by all kinds of no swimming bouys where you're not supposed to go. Luckily we had a map to the prime locations which just weren't very good. Maybe a bad time of year. If you want good snorkeling, go to the Bahia Honda park and take a trip to the Looe Key. ","March 8, 2016","An interesting location, snorkeling is mediocre at best",25,"Williston, Vermont",3

The architecture, the glorious water, the wildlife, the view...everything is just perfect!We only stayed for 2 1/2 hours and came over on the seaplane (the way to go in our opinion!!!), but it was absolutely perfect. I truly think we could have stayed all day and still seen something new every time we walked around it.They offer snorkeling, camping, sight seeing, etc. The bathrooms are compost toilets, though when the ferry is in dock, you use their bathrooms. There are picnic tables to eat on and plenty of amazingly gorgeous views to take it. It's pure perfection!Watch your step, wear sunscreen, bring a picnic, your camera and enjoy the view!(Research your visit in advance as there are certain times the part of the island is closed off due to nesting/breeding season for the birds.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I had been dreaming about visiting the Dry Tortugas ever since high school, and, in fact, this excursion was the centerpiece of a 16 day road trip from our home in southeast MN. Booking on line was extremely convenient. The trip itself was great. After checking in at the Key West Ferry Terminal building, we were given an orientation by one of the crew, Jeff, given an opportunity to secure Dramamine, given a chance to chat with a Park Ranger, and then boarded. Upon boarding we were given access to a breakfast buffet which was very functional. Eggs, cereal, yogurt, fruit, bagels, toast, coffee, juice all were made available; you just had to finish getting food by 8:30. The two and a half hour trip flew by, with orientation videos and more informative talks. Upon arrival at 10:30, we had to leave the boat, which was fine. We had brought our own snorkel gear (and rented wet suits - it was February, after all). Setting up on the beach, we changed into our snorkel gear and set out for the first of two 90 minute explorations. Beginning at the South concrete pier, we explored the South coaling pilings (at the Park Ranger's suggestion) and were treated to a host of varied fish! Returning to the beach, we headed back to the ferry to build our buffet lunches and then back to the beach. The second snorkel trip started out less satisfactorily; the sea grass beds had very little fish and the water was extremely turgid, due to several days of strong Easterly winds. The moat wall proved more fulfilling as did a return to the pilings. Getting out, we finally explored the Fort a little, climbing to the top of the wall to survey the birds congregating on the island and getting a photo op.(earlier I had checked out Dr. Mudd's cell - history is more of an interest to me than my wife). Then it was time to get back to the Ferry (by 2:45) for a 3:00 return to Key West. We spent much of the trip back forward in the bow, looking for dolphins and other jumping fish. All in all, a great day.","March 6, 2016",The Trip of a lifetime,13,"Lanesboro, Minnesota",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"An impressive fort, seemingly in the middle of no-where surrounded by beautiful water.Since we would spend over 4 hours on the large, stable 112' boat, we used ""Windfinder Pro"" app to view Dry Tortugas wind/wave forecast. In early March, we booked 3 days ahead, forecast held and we had 1 foot seas vs. 5-6 feet some nearby days. Windy days may be good during hot summer months as it gets warm off the boat. Park all day for $13 at near-by city garage on Grinnell street and walk Key West after returning even catch sunset at Mallory Square if you haven't been there before. Bring your National Park pass & get $10 refund per person at check-in. The boat, included continental breakfast, included deli-style lunch & staff service were all good. Lots of seating inside on deck 1 & 2, outside on deck 2 stern and standing area on bow - a good place to be on final approach to the fort and to Key West.Definitely take the 1 hour guided tour. While waiting for our tour time, we walked around the outside of the fort to get a perspective outside the moat. If you plan to snorkel, sign up for an early tour. After our 11:15 tour and lunch, we still had 1 1/2 hours for snorkeling...or could have spent more time walking the fort. We don't miss many snorkel opportunities. Snorkel, fins and mask are provided. This day, snorkeling at north coaling dock ruins was average. We did not snorkel south shore coral heads area. Wet suits were helpful for early March water temp but many people did not have wet suits. An Iowa couple rented suits at dive shop near the boat. Warm, fresh water rinse off showers on the boat.

We signed up for the tour given by one of the rangers from the boat and he was so knowledgeable and so enthusiastic it made for a great tour. It really made the whole trip worth it.

We flew in a classic De Havilland Otter about 500 ft above the water. The view of the islands, shipwrecks, marine life, Fort Jefferson and the amazing, emerald blue water was stunning. Our pilot Evan was very professional and experienced. He was also very informative, pointing out the sights and narrating the trip. The landings (both on land and water) were extremely smooth and the ride was very comfortable, especially for a no-frills plane. Dry Tortugas was beautiful. We arrived hours before the ferry boat so it felt like we had the whole island to ourselves. The beaches were beautiful and color of the water was so blue. The self-guided tour of the fort was very cool. We got to see and learn a lot of history. Our only regret is that we only booked the half day trip. The 2 1/2 hours went by very quickly between exploring the fort and snorkeling and swimming a little. We wanted more time to explore the rest of the island, the bird sanctuary, and to have time to relax on the beautiful, remote beach.

The 10 of us on the plane were the only people ( other than a few campers and rangers that live there) on the island for a couple hours. The day we went (Feb. 19) was a bit windy so we opted out of Snorkeling but even without the water activity we had a great time exploring the Fort and the Island. It was truly beautiful. The plane ride to and from the Island was an adventure all by itself. Our Pilot, Evan, did a fabulous job. Even with the wind he kept the plane stable.

Walking around the site was a cool experience. The snorkeling was great! I would highly recommend a trip to the southernmost national park if you get the chance. I would also recommend taking a seaplane rather then the long ferry ride. The advice we received regarding timing of our tour was spot on, we went on the last tour so that the ferry would be leaving as we arrived and pretty much had the whole island to ourselves.","February 23, 2016",Amazing National Park,18,"Rogers, Arkansas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"When I departed the seaplane I took to Dry Tortugas I was in awe. The water was blue and green like what you see on tv.

You have got to go!","February 21, 2016",Amazing!!,12,"Long Island, New York",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was intrigued by Dry Tortugas Nat'l Park and why Ft. Jefferson was sitting 70 miles out in the Gulf. The trip on the Yankee Freedom III and the tour of the fort provided a fascinating window into that period of history. The trip over on the Yankee Freedom was wonderful; the trip takes about 2.5 hours and the crew does a great job orienting the passengers to what to expect and do at the NP, as well as the history and islands you encounter during the passage. At first I was skeptical because of the expensive ferry ride over, but after experiencing it I was sold. Food is provided in the price of the ferry and the breakfast and lunch buffets are simple yet high quality. Snorkeling gear and tours of the fort are provided as well so the ferry fare is very inclusive. When you consider this as an all day activity with everything included, the price seems more reasonable.The fort is an incredible structure, built around the period of the Civil War and has a fascinating history. In addition to the fort, there are snorkeling and birding opportunities. This is a high quality tour of a unique National Park and is highly recommended.","February 21, 2016",Beauty and History,138,"Olathe, Kansas",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"In addition to this page I left a review for seaplane adventures, which is the only way to get there. As in my review at their site I mentioned the incredible advantages to seaplane over the showboat. Now to the site itself, it can be walked around in about an hour, and there's snorkeling as well. The views of the fort while in the air are spectacular. There are no guided tours so its on your own,,, A guide would have been nice but I read up on it before so had some knowledge, I would recommend this too. Some areas are off limits due to decay but overall the fort was very impressive to see, and definitely worth the visit, just take the seaplane and save yourself the 5 hour showboat ride.","February 20, 2016",WORTH THE TREK,31,"Boston, Massachusetts",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Well worth spending a day to make this unique experience a lifetime memory. Been to Key West probably a dozen times before & regret not taking the trip previously. Ferry package isn't inexpensive at $175 pp, but includes breakfast, lunch, guided tour, & snorkeling gear so a pretty decent tourist value.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas is not easily accessible, nor a low cost attraction to visit - which keeps the crowds low. After reading reviews about seasickness on the ferry to Dry Tortugas, and not really wanting to spend at least 5 hours on a boat to get there, we opted for the seaplane tour. Well worth it for the speed (only about a half hour ride to get there), and for the incredible views from the air. The plane is bare bones, but all seats have a window. It's a beautiful flight and also neat to spot aquatic wildlife from above. The park itself is small and not much in the way of information, and ranger tours are not standard. The best aspect is walking the perimeter of the fort from the top level for the views. The fort is in some state of disrepair and is presently being worked on. There are no amenities there, so either bring your own or the tour operators offer some (we got drinks and snorkel equipment as part of the seaplane tour). Snorkeling is ok there, but there are many other locations you can snorkel without needing to make the trek to Dry Tortugas. We did the half day tour, and that was enough time.","February 19, 2016","Scenic, minimal crowd National Park",18,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,I highly recommend taking the sea plane. Only a 35 minute flight vs. two to two and a half hours on ferry (one way). Plus we had the island pretty much to ourselves the entire time before ferry came. Unique place to wander about and interesting history. Even had some nice beach time. We did not snorkel as it was a bit chilly but there are great spots.,"February 19, 2016",Great place to tour!,8,"Benson, Minnesota",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Besides the history as a military outpost and then prison, Dry Tortugas is simply a stunning little island surrounded by crystal blue water to the horizon in every direction. If it's a calm day (no strong winds) you can do some of the best snorkeling in North America, included with the trip, take a tour of the building, or just wander around the island to picnic and birdwatch. I bought the ticket just a few days before, but it's a bit expensive and the boat ride is 2.5 hours each way, so next time I hope to plan ahead and camp there for one or two nights. It must be incredible to be all the way out there with nobody around for 37 miles!","February 18, 2016",One of the most beautiful tiny islands you'll find,5,NYC,5

Got windy towards the end of the day so snorkeling became a bit of a challenge. I swear I was almost eaten by a shark but my husband told me it was clearly a grouper (Debatable). Either way snarling around the base of the fort and getting to see all of the sea creatures is just the coolest thing ever, and then there is the fort itself to explore which is really nice and great for history lovers.","February 18, 2016",Sea Plane Adventure,363,"New London, Connecticut",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is a gorgeous, unique place and great Key West Day trip! The national park rangers and crew of The Yankee Freedom are first class and ensure you have the best experience. The park itself has a ton of history and is absolutely stunning. With that being said, it was a really tough trip...I am not sure this trip was worth it on a windy day with temps less than 75, given the 5hr round trip boat ride on rough waters. If there are low winds and sunny warm weather, then no question! We were most looking forward to the world class snorkeling and although it was 71 and sunny, the wind was about 20-25mph which made snorkeling impossible, even on the 'calm' side or the fort- we left seeing only sea grass. Or if the history is the main draw for you , then it would also be worth it. The boat ride was way too rough so we spent the 2.5 hrs each way trying to not think about how we felt ill as well as not look at all the others that were. Consider cancelling by 5pm the night before if A+ weather is not in the forecast. Be sure to take Dramamine!!!

A wonderful place to spend about five hours. It was not a good day for snorkeling, but quite nice even so -- walk around the fort, catch the royal terns and black skimmers lined up along the sea wall, take a nap on the beach, enjoy some shade and a great lunch sandwich (you build your own from a great array of choices) on board the boat.

The landing was smooth, and after motoring up to land, we hopped off the plane. Fort Jefferson is very large (made of 16 million bricks which will be repeated a lot). The stroll along the top of the fort provided great views. However, our favorite activity was strolling along Bush Key which is only connected by land some parts of year, and only accessible outside nesting season. A recent storm brought ashore numerous live Conch shells which we dutifully ""saved"" and through back in the water, and Portugues Man-O-War jelly fish which we popped instead. The Dry Tortugas are a wonderful place to snorkel, but it was a little too cold for us in January.The boat takes 2.5 hours each way which is why we took the plane being prone to seasickness.

On a calm day you can see the dolphins, sharks, turtles through the water from the bow and even if it's choppy you'll still see plenty of flying fish scared by the boat. At the fort, the historical tour is great, the snorkeling is nice (really get out there away from shore and explore the coral heads), the gear is provided if you don't have any, and there's a bar on the boat for the ride back if you choose.

This was our third trip to Key West and we had done most of the activities so we were looking for something different. We decided to take the ferry (vs. the plane) due to the cost of flying over. We really enjoyed the ferry. Staff was super friendly and helpful, food was decent (breakfast and lunch) and they really provide everything you need for an enjoyable day. The park itself was really interesting. We spent most of the time snorkeling and the rest of the time exploring the fort. If you are adventurous, they also allow camping on the island. It is very restrictive though and you have to reserve in advance so something to think about.","January 25, 2016",Great day trip,27,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Toured Dry Tortugas/Fort Jefferson on Jan 20th via the Yankee Freedom III ferry boat ride. It turned out to be a very beautiful day and memorable trip. The fort itself is pretty amazing and the history behind it is very interesting. There are a lot of informative plaques around the fort giving information about various things such as how many bricks were used to build the fort. The only thing I can say is I think they should probably give a little TLC to some of the plaques that are exposed to the elements because they were a little faded. The Yankee Freedom crew provides a tour guide that gives an informative tour of the fort and area. I suggest taking advantage of the guided tour versus going it completely solo. It is such a beautiful spot to visit. If you are a lover of nature, architecture, history and photography then I feel you would enjoy it greatly. If I go back to Key West in the future I would like to go back to Dry Tortugas. I would plan on going when it is warmer weather so maybe next time I can go snorkeling. I might even do the camping option.","January 24, 2016",Awesome historic sight with breath-taking views...,16,"Birmingham, Alabama",5

Excellent support from the crew and the park rangers who enhanced our day with narration and tours. The Fort itself is a historical marvel. The guided tour is well worth an hour or so at the Park, but roam on your own if you like. Glorious sea birds and coral and native plants all around. Two beaches for swimming and scuba.

Dry Tortugas National Park,I was really looking forward to this trip and it was definitely worth it. The place is beautiful - great for snorkeling (wear something that will cover your back - it is easy to get sunburnt in the water) - I saw quite a variety of colorful fish and a stingray!

The ride over however was not very good as about half of the people on the boat were sick. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. On the way back most of those who had been sick took dramamine and slept on the ride back. I guess I didn't realize the boat ride would be as long and rough as it was. Be sure to read the information presented on the website. It wasn't a good day for snorkeling as most people couldn't see anything. I'm glad we did it once but probably won't go back.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a wonderful day trip, but I strongly urge you to go by seaplane, instead of by boat. Not only is the trip much shorter, but should the water be rough, your boat ride may not be very enjoyable. The day we went, the seas were rough, and many of the people getting off the boat were seasick, which ruined their trip. If you are going to go by boat, you might want to check the seas before heading out. Beautiful fort, very historic, and amazing pictures!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I am a writer and photographer for National Park Planner (npplan.com) and I visited Dry Tortugas National Park in February 2015. Dry Tortugas National Park is the most remote National Park in the lower 48 states. It is comprised of seven islands, or “keys,” about 70 miles west of Key West, Florida. These keys represent the end of the Florida Key reef system. The park can be reached via a daily ferry or seaplane service run by authorized concessionaires (both leave from Key West), or in your own boat or seaplane.Of the seven keys in the park, most people only visit Garden Key. This is the island on which the ferry and seaplanes drop off passengers, and it is the only island with tourist amenities and attractions. Here you will find the park’s Visitor Center, Fort Jefferson (which occupies about 85% of the island), a campground and picnic tables, and plenty of places to swim and snorkel. Fishing is also allowed from the island.Bush Key is the second most visited key because it is right next to Garden Key and is often connected to it by a thin sandbar. However, it is closed for most of the year, open only from mid-October until mid-January.Of the remaining keys, only Loggerhead Key is open to visitors. All others are closed due to wildlife nesting. Other than Garden Key, and possibly Bush Key if the sandbar exists, visiting any other island requires that you have your own boat.The Dry Tortugas area first gained significance after the War of 1812. The British had easily blockaded and captured coastal cities along the east coast, and even burned Washington, D.C., to the ground. After the war, the US government realized that coastal forts were needed to protect the country from invasion, and construction began on dozens of heavily armed masonary forts, many of which are National Park properties today. Fort Jefferson was part of this coastal defense system.Any ship sailing from the Gulf of Mexico to the east coast of the United States had to travel between Florida and Cuba, and the only channel deep enough for large ships flowed right past Garden Key, which made it the perfect place for a fort. Construction began in 1846, but Fort Jefferson was never completed, nor was it ever used other than as a prison during the Civil War. Technology and modern war tactics soon made it obsolete. It was used as a Navy fueling station until 1916, then abandoned.The area became a wildlife refugee in 1908, and in 1935 the Fort Jefferson National Monument was created to preserve the fort and the surrounding refugee. After being expanded, the National Monument became Dry Tortugas National Park in 1992.For complete information on visiting Dry Tortugas National Park, plus dozens of beautiful photos, visit National Park Planner.","January 21, 2016",Dry Tortugas National Park,201,"Roswell, Georgia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The interesting thing about the Dry Tortugas National Park is that you can't get there! Well, you can but you have to plan for it; be ready to spend a day; and, take a seaplane or ride a ferry for 2 1/2 hours one way. Was it worth it? Damn right skippy! We took the ferry two years in a row because we enjoyed the experience so much.The ferry operation is extremely well run. The ferry is efficient, clean, and runs on time. Breakfast is served on the way over and is included in the price of the ferry. Lunch is served while at the park and is included in the price of the ferry. There is a tour of Fort Jefferson included in the price of the ferry. The tour is conducted by a lecturer on the ferry or by a park ranger. Often there are several tours offered.Swimming and snorkeling are permitted. Snorkeling gear is provided in the cost of the ferry. The waters surrounding the port are crystal clear and shallow making for excellent swimming/snorkeling.What more needs to be said.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I have been wanting to go to the Dry Tortugas National Park for years, and are so glad we finally did. We opted for the Ferry, which was great. We are not that into forts, so we chose a self guided tour, which did not take more than a half an hour. Saw the lighthouse, Dr. Mudd's Cell, walked the moat and saw the displays in the visitor center. While we did try to snorkel, the water was a bit cloudy, but was still beautiful. We went to unplug for just a little while. We sat in silence for hours watching the waves. It was the most calming thing I have ever done and am so grateful for the experience.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I've been wanting to come here for years but was sort of the fence about whether it was worth the time and effort and worried my husband would be bored. Well I'm so glad I finally went. We took the ferry over. I booked tickets online in advance and we found the ferry location and parking easily enough. The ferry ride over was so much fun. We saw dolphins, flying fish, turtles and of course approaching the dry tortugas from afar felt very 'pirates of the carribean'-ish. Once we were there my husband and I toured the fort on our own for just a short while; I was eager to get in the water. At first I didn't really know the best place to snorkel, even though I had done some research beforehand. Finally we realized that the best place really is just along the outer moat wall. There I saw the hugest rainbow parrotfish ever, though I didn't see much else. The water was warm and crystal clear and amazing. I didn't even bother having lunch because I was having too much fun. I also swam along the old pilings but didn't think it was as interesting. I sadly did not see carlos the crocodile. On the way back on the ferry I drank delicious painkillers and saw many more turtles. I think in the end, my husband was a tad bored but I absolutely loved it and I want to come back here and camp overnight.","January 19, 2016",I loved it!,21,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Visiting the Dry Tortugas and Fort Jefferson is a day long commitment but makes for an excellent day. We took the ferry, Yankee Freedom, out to the Fort, which was a 2 1/2 - 3 hour ferry ride. This could be a rough ride, so be prepared and if you get seasick easily, I'd recommend that you ride outside at the back of the boat. A light breakfast is served as you board at 7:30 a.m. When you get to the site, you can take tours of the moat (nature tours), of the Fort (historical tours) and/or go snorkeling on the Island. My husband was intending to go snorkeling as well as touring the Fort, but there really wasn't time for both so we ended up taking both of the tours. Our tour guide, Ranger Mike, made them very interesting. The moat tour was a little disappointing because there wasn't much sea life to see that day, but it was fun walking around on the moat wall. The history tour of the Fort could have lasted at least an hour longer. We didn't have the time to visit Dr. Mudd's cell, which was something we both had wanted to see. Lunch of sandwiches and salads was served on the ferry or you could take them and eat on one of the many picnic tables on the Island. Another option that would be fun is the chance to camp on the Island. Being on the island for a longer time, and being able to snorkel after everyone else leaves would be a great experience. If you decide to do that, though, remember that you have to take everything that you intend to use - including all of your water. We returned to Key West about 5:00/5:30.","January 18, 2016",Day visit to Dry Tortugas an excellent experience.,10,"Bertrand, Nebraska",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,Title says it all. Don't think about it and just go. It's absolutely stunning in the middle of the gulf with no one for miles around you. The history and ecosystem here is amazing and the fact that it's the hardest national park in the US to get to makes it all the better. Best way to experience the park is to take the seaplane. It's leaves in the morning from the airport and only takes 10 people at a time to the island. It takes 45 minutes and you fly so low that you can see animals in the water. Tour guide is awesome too. Plus they give you snacks and very nice professional snorkeling equipment to use. You get an hour and a half on the island just you nine others and a few park rangers. Snorkeling is great and the reef around the island is amazing. Just be careful of jellyfish and the ruins you are swimming through. Best part. The boat that brings most people to the island gets there when the plane is leaving. The boat has over a hundred people and takes three hours each way and same time on the island. So the 300 a plane ticket was more than worth it for us. ,"January 18, 2016",Go just go! ,10,"Wayne, Pennsylvania",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The beauty and isolation of this place can not be adequately described with words. If you really want to experience the isolation and prove your self sufficiency, spend a night or two! If you are prone to motion sickness make sure and take Dramamine (or consider the plane ride). The boat and crew were great, but it is a 2+ hour ride and there are likely to be some waves. The food on the boat was all very good. The island and fort are incredible! This is an amazing piece of history and beauty that is missed by the majority. We stayed one night and unfortunately it rained, so we missed the starry skies that we were all looking forward to, but we still had a great time. The snorkeling is great and my son got to touch a Goliath Grouper (about 5 feet long and too big to hug). Even though we were rained out, we are already looking forward to next year and planning on spending 2-3 nights (after the cost of the boat ride, camping is only $15 per night).

Snorkeling is awesome around the pilings on the side of the fort and bird watching in great on the other side of the fort. So much history here from the war era to Dr. Mudd serving a prison term here. You can take your own snorkeling gear, I would suggest a small cooler for your own water or soda (no alcohol allowed), change of clothes, and beach towels If you are not used to traveling on the seas in a smaller vessel, make sure the day you pick the sea waves are under seven feet.

We all did fine although we heard some did suffer from sea sickness.When we arrived at Dry Tortugas after a two and a half hour ride, we took a quick walk around the fort on the moat pathway. We then did the thudded tour of the fort which we all enjoyed. The fort has three levels and you could gp through much of it.

That worked for us but if you ea t ,ore time you could skip the tour.It was a great, albeit tiring, day! Food was fine. Bagels at breakfast were fresh. Sandwiches and salad for lunch. Not gourmet but basic and tasty.We returned right on time at 5.30.Tip,for tour guides was suggested,","December 31, 2015","Amazing day of adventure,",26,"Storrs, Connecticut",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Nice day trip 70 miles west of Key West. We used a company that had a 100 person engine power catamaran style boat. The wind was high that day and we were warned about that. They would refund us our money if we decided against it. We went anyway. Once 20 miles from shore, the waves were pretty large. Many people became sick and did vomit. I had taken Dramamine which was available on the ship and was ok. After the trip, arrival at the island was beautiful. We were given a tour, another meal (breakfast when we first boarded) and given a few hours of free time to use snorkeling gear or just roam the island.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We have tried to get to the Dry Tortugas on three separate trips. The wind has always prevented us from going. Despite the ferry going to the fort almost 365 days a year, I would not suggest it unless it is a light wind day. If you don't have plans to snorkel you could go at almost any time (baring that you don't get seasick). My primary interest in going was snorkeling so I am glad we waited for that very rare, wind free day! The waters are crystal clear and the marine life around the old jetties is teeming. I thought that there would be more of a reef, but we saw plenty around the jetties. A highlight was a near 400 pound Goliath Grouper who hung out between the X Braces. It took my breath away when I first saw him as he did not move at all. He just checked us out and hung under the brace. I still kept my eye on him LOL. We saw more at the jetty area closest to the ferry. We did try to snorkel around the whole length of the fort but I lost interest half way and wanted to save my energy for walking the fort. Birders will also be delighted in the fort. I was really surprised at the number of interesting song birds inside the fort grounds. Binoculars would be a good idea. Lunch and breakfast were adequate and the cocktails hit the spot on the ride back to Key West. I really recommend this trip if you want a day to escape the craziness of Key West. I would wait until you are absolutely sure about the weather and wind before you book the trip. We went during Fantasy Fest week and there was still plenty of seats when I booked the day before.","December 30, 2015",Bucket List Trip,232,"Ponce Inlet, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the ferry out to the Dry Tortugas and Fort Jackson. We rode the Yankee Freedom III out of Key West. The trip left at 8:00 AM and got back at 5:30 PM. It is a long day, but well worth the time. We got a light breakfast and lunch as a part of the ticket. You get to spend about 5 hours on the island. We chose to take the guided tour, led by Jeff. He was so knowledgable about the history. I am glad we did this, instead of walking around on our own. Please, Please, Please take their advice about taking motion sickness medication before the trip. Also, if they say to stay seated due to rough seas...again follow their directions. They know the water better than we do and are worried about safety and health. We took Dramamine before we left port and again after lunch before we left the fort. They have it available for purchase at the port and on the boat.It was a good call for everyone. The seas were crazy on the ride back. I didn't get sick at all!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was an extended family trip - my wife and I (we are in our 50's), our two kids (early 20's) and my parents (you do the math). My Dad gets around pretty well, but he does have some mobility issues due to a bad hip.We went Christmas week, and we booked this trip months in advance. I learned this when I tried to book it about a month before last year's Key West vacation Christmas week - and was shut out. Plan this one in advance!This is a full day excursion - we arrived at the terminal at 7:15 am and did not return until about 5:30. The trip is about 2 1/2 hours each way. But, the ferry is comfortable and the scenery is beautiful. If you're prone to motion sickness, plan accordingly. There were multiple passengers each leg of the trip who were having a pretty rough time. Upon boarding, they served a decent continental breakfast, with fresh bagels, yogurts, cereals, hard boiled eggs. Coffee was ok, but here's a tip - the Cuban Coffee Queen is just a couple blocks from the terminal - grab a coffee there before boarding.We arrived at the national park a little after 10:30 and disembarked at 10:45 am. We were told that we needed to be ready to re-board by 2:30 pm, which gave us a little less than 4 hours at the park. We found that to be sufficient. There are limited spots for the morning guided tour, but there are available materials to download to a smart phone for a decent self-guided tour, and we were happy with that. The fort is MASSIVE, and we spent well over an hour exploring it. Some of the stairs were tricky for my father, and he wound up skipping the upper level and returning to the start. Tip: Bring water with you on the tour - much of the walking is out in the open sun, and it is very easy to get de-hydrated. After touring, we went back to the boat for lunch. It was a sandwich buffet with cold cuts, tuna salad, and peanut butter and jelly as the main options. Bottled water and soda were provided during the timing of the buffet, but we grabbed a few bottles to drink later in the afternoon.Most of our party hit the small but beautiful beach after lunch. My son and I went snorkeling. The equipment was in decent, but not great, shape. Ask the crew for suggestions on where to go. It had been very windy in the days leading up to our trip, and the waters were not all that clear. So, they suggested that we go to the North end of the Island and snorkel along the fort wall. There was some coral forming on the wall, and we did see quite a few fish, but nothing that spectacular or memorable compared to other tropical or semi-tropical snorkeling sites. Trip back was very enjoyable - we sat on the upper deck and enjoyed the sun and the breeze. The ship's bar was very reasonably priced, and after an hour of snorkeling, it was a great feeling to sit in the sun with a beer on a fast-moving boat.This is not the type of excursion that we would do every year or even every other year. My guess is that we'll think about coming back again in about 5 years. It is a long, tiring day and it is expensive. But, we are certainly glad that we did this trip and unhesitatingly recommend it for those who can afford it and who have the time. But, I would not suggest this for someone who is in Key West for only a few days.","December 26, 2015",A must for history buffs - and a fine day at sea.,26,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We've been coming to the keys for years now, but this is the first year when we actually took the Dry Tortugas trip, since it's quite pricey. We went by boat. The boat is big enough for people not to get seasick, although before the trip they sell you motion sickness pills ($1 per person) and most people use it. Most importantly, since we were concerned about this, we found out it was not an issue on an average day. We went in December when everything was booked up, so there were just a few vacant seats and most people had to sit next to somebody else on the boat if you were sitting at a table -- they all accommodate 6 people. It's hard to say where they have the best seats, but if you don't take your seats right on boarding, there will be none left right away. Most people rushed for breakfast right away. Breakfast is nice with cereal, bagels, cream cheese, fruit salad, orange juice. What surprised me was that one had to pay for coffee additionally, which doesn't make any sense considering the cost of the trip. It's not like they really needed that $1 per coffee paid additionally and this looked cheap. It's almost exactly 2,5 hours to the fort. People were given the option of signing up for a longer excursion of one and a half hours or a shorter of 45 minutes. If there were more people, they would open another list with a later time excursion (the first two were on arrival at 11 am). Excursions were fine in December. I am not sure how people could do them in hot months. It was hot even in December with the temp at 80. Lunch already starts when the excursion ends, so we felt everything was happening in a hurry. Lunch consisted of ham, turkey slices, American and swiss cheese, salad, and soda and bottled water. After lunch you have about two hours for the rest, so if you want to do snorkeling, there is really not that much time, although we managed to snorkel in all three recommended places and we liked it. Nothing spectacular, but in one place we saw a huge school of fish and that was exciting. Also, the fort is about 3/5 of a mile in perimeter and you can walk around in 15 minutes, actually seeing interesting fish on both sides, in the moat and in the ocean. I think the stay on the island is somewhat rushed if you want to do the excursion and another hour would be great, since there was absolutely no need to leave at 2:45, we could've easily spent another hour there. On the way back, you have to pay for all the drinks, and this is cheap too. Overall, a very nice trip but some things could easily be improved and the reasonable cost for that kind of trip should be about $50 less.","December 20, 2015",Trip to Dry Tortugas with kids,14,"Saint Cloud, Minnesota",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I can't even explain how wonderful our day was at Dry Tortugas. You are probably thinking the following, as I had these same thoughts and questions when considering the trip:- It's so expensive. Response: Yes, it is expensive. However, you won't regret it. Worth every penny. Make it a priority. If it's the only ""excursion"" you can afford to do, it will still be worth it. Also consider that breakfast and lunch are included. Hint: After researching online, later an add popped up while I was surfing with a coupon code for $25 off/person. - The ferry ride is so long. Response: The staff on the ferry (the ""Yankee Freedom"") help make the long ferry ride very comfortable. They feed you breakfast on the way there, and provide lunch as well. On the way back, they have a cash bar. It was a long trip to get there, but it was worth it!- What is there to do? Response: First of all, take the guided tour that is offered. It is free. The tour was so well done, that my appreciation for the place grew exponentially and my overall response to my experience there was completely changed. It truly is a national treasure (hence why it is a national park.) We then took the walk around the moat and look for sea life. Tons of beautiful fish can be seen. In lieu of snorkeling, we decided to explore the interior of the fort. Wow, we just had an intense experience going up to the top level of the fort and enjoying the expansive views. I know the snorkeling is good there, but we saw many jelly fish and decided against it. You can also camp there overnight. We saw the campsites. If we ever return to Key West (which I hope we do), we will camp overnight. 4 hours at the fort is just not enough.Tip:- I would not recommend coming here with small children, unless you have only one and they are well behaved. We were lucky to have grandma along to watch our kids. Teens will be fine and have a blast. We saw many family's trips become difficult with small children.","December 18, 2015","Hands down, best thing to do while in Key West",109,"Eden Prairie, Minnesota",5

It whole trip is a package with Breakfast and lunch Services on board. The food was great . The staff is very nice . Once you get here you can do the self guided tour or there is tour that the staff gives either ways its excellent . The water is blue crisp and you can see the marine life very well. Great place to snorkel. The tour of the parks takes about 45 mini or so. But there is plenty of things to do after that. You can swim and chill on the beach just relax look around. There are no facilitates on the park you have to use to the one on-board. Which are clean the staff does a very good job of keeping things clean. There is a water hose to wash down and also warm water shower for the beach lovers. It does get a bit hectic, but worth every penny. If you do this you wont do anything in the evening. The best thing is its very quite and peaceful and since its only on ferry a day its not very very crowded as well. They have coffee all the time and snacks are also available.

The snorkeling at the fort is OK if you've never snorkeled anywhere else; the water was clear with decent visibility, but the coral is unimpressive with a lot of sand on much of it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"After seeing so many photos of the beautiful blue water and the fort on the Dry Tortugas, we decided to check it out. It is a beautiful short flight on a sea plane over gorgeous water and tiny islands to your destination. On the way you can see sting rays and sharks as you fly fairly low. I recommend Dramamine if u get car sick as it is a small plane and perhaps a water or Gatorade. You fly with head phones on and the pilot gives you a little history lesson on the way. Once you touch down you can explore the fort and walk around the island and snorkel but not a ton to do so make sure the weather is nice. Take food & drinks as there is nothing over there but restrooms and a gift shop. There are a few tents full of die hard campers but little else. My son enjoyed fishing and walking around and we sat on the small beach with our teen daughter and snorkeled a bit. Glad we saw it but no real need to go back...

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you are in Key West and have the time and want to do something out of the ordinary this is the excursion for you! I was taken to Key West, Florida for a surprise 40th birthday trip (mine!). The Dry Tortuga's National Park was 1 of only 2 excursions we planned ahead of time. What you need to know is that it is located many miles south of Key West and there are only 2 ways there...ferry or sea plane. The ferry ride is several hours long and the sea plane ride is approx 45 min each way. We chose sea plane. It is more expensive but faster! If I ever get to go back I would love to take an entire day and take the ferry down knowing full well that I an in for a long, leisurely day at sea. The plane ride was excellent. The captain was incredibly knowledgeable and pointed out several ship wrecks and points of interest along the way. It was also interesting that you could see turtles and sharks from our plane!!! Once you arrive you are pretty much on your own. You can snorkel around the area, explore the fort or just bask in the sun on the beach. We were very excited to snorkel. It was a breezy day and sadly the sand was pretty churned up and snorkeling was not great. We meandered around the fort and the beach where we found a marked turtle nest much to my delight.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Came to Key West with some girlfriends from Wyoming, California, and South Carolina to celebrate a milestone birthday. Booked a couple of excursions through our hotel concierge and one of them was the Dry Tortugas National Park Ferry with promises of snorkeling and other primarily water-based activities. We went on a different excursion yesterday with Fury Tours and they gave us a full disclosure about the higher than normal jellyfish population and gave us the option to cancel our excursion with a full refund no questions asked. We called our concierge to cancel this excursion last night but did not receive a call back. Since we were unable to cancel last night, we showed up to the the ferry this morning to cancel due to jellyfish and to get our refund. The front desk ticket clerk Angie was quite rude and informed us that a refund was not possible and that she could only give us a three year non-transferrable rain check - which is of no value to us since we live all over the country. She gave me the phone number of the General Manager and I am currently waiting for a call back since he is the only one who can offer refunds. I cannot express how incredibly rude Angie was and I overheard her loudly complaining about us to her colleague at the ticket window where other customers could hear. Wildly unprofessional. Basically she thinks we're crazy to not want to do water activities because the jellyfish ""aren't that bad"" even though another tour company allowed us to cancel our tour with a full refund due to jellyfish. When I asked why there wasn't a manager on site to resolve this issue she haughtily explained to me that in corporate America, General Managers don't work on weekends. Umm... In the tourism industry where the bulk of your customers come on the weekend I would hope that there would be a manager on site to resolve customer service issues. We still canceled our tour and are awaiting a call back from the GM. Hopefully we can get a refund.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Look, let's be blunt: it cost me $175 to go on this trip, which is a lot of money. Was it worth $175? I'm not 100% sure, but I'm glad I went. If you don't bring your own motion sickness medicine, they'll sell you Dramamine for $1 per dose. The sea was rough, so it was the best $1 I spent that day. Food wasn't gourmet...but decent, and it was a buffet where multiple trips were permitted. Breakfast included hard boiled eggs and ham for those who like a protein source. Lunch was make-your-own sandwiches with some sides. I wanted to go on the 11:00 am tour, so I immediately hopped out of my seat and raced over to sign up as soon as possible (and ended up midway down the list of 25 slots). Ft. Jefferson is interesting and the highlight of the trip. Did some snorkeling and swimming after the tour (and lunch) - it's not great snorkeling by any means and the water wasn't super clear due to high winds, but I saw some fish and the water was relatively warm. For those looking for a cheaper option, I also enjoyed touring Ft. Zachary Taylor which cost me less than $3 (plus $10 bike rental to get there).","December 2, 2015",Not cheap but glad I went,6,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The boat ride out and back (2.5 hours each way) is a tad tedious, though the crew provide a great breakfast, lunch, drinks, and snacks. You can a guided tour, but we opted to follow the soldier signs and walk on our own. It is a huge fort and very unique - all brick, surrounded by water and a moat!The park also offers a narrow stretch of beach for some sunbathing and snorkeling and a chance to watch terns and pelicans. You can make your lunch and head outside to the picnic areas, if desired. If you take the ferry out, you have about 4 hours to explore - more than enough time. There is, of course, a small shop to grab some books, maps and souvenirs.","December 2, 2015",A wonderful glimpse of history with beautiful scenery,40,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We went to the Dry Tortugas on the Yankee Freedom III catamaran ferry. I booked the trip via the phone the day before as the weather was predicted to be good. There was no problem getting a reservation in the slow season. The trip is expensive in my opinion but they did accept a coupon from one of the tourist brochures I picked up in Florida City. I also had a National Park Senior Pass so had the park entrance fee refunded at check-in at the main Seaport Terminal. The only parking is in the city garage close by at $13 a day. The boat had an adequate buffet breakfast on-board before starting off which was very convenient for the early start. It was a full 2 1/2 hour ride out to the park that included a few minutes stop to observe dolphins. The trip was very nice in the calm weather. There is both inside and outside seating and it would pay to line up early in the terminal if you have a strong seating preference. There is a bar on-board and store for buying extra food and souvenir items. They also have a couple of photo albums to look at with historical photos. We signed up for the guided tour of Fort Jefferson which was included. They said there would be a 2nd tour if there were too many people for the first one. There was also a history tour which we missed. A buffet lunch was set up on-board and included, but took a bit of time. The buffet was very good. Drinks were provided but for a limited time as they wanted you to buy bar drinks. All the crew members on the ship were very friendly and helpful during the trip and added to the overall enjoyment.After the guided tour, I walked around the fort area and moat on my own and also out onto Bush Key as there were no nesting birds and you were allowed to walk there. The 4 hours you have on land goes by quite quickly with waiting time for lunch and the tour etc. I planned to snorkel but never had the time. However, the majority of the people on the boat seemed to spend most of their time on the beach. Despite all the positive comments in the reviews here for snorkeling, most of the people were in areas where you could clearly see from land there was no coral. It seemed a long way to come just for the beach. My companion went swimming instead of walking around and said the water was very nice with a sand bottom. I think the highlight of this trip is definitely seeing Fort Jefferson, the Visitor Center, and learning its history, and not the shoreline snorkeling experience, especially compared to the snorkel boat trips at Key Largo.","December 1, 2015",Amazing Fort,326,SAINT PETERSBURG,4
Dry Tortugas National Park,We traveled on the National Parks Ferry and were well fed (breakfast and lunch). Be aware that the seas can be rough on the way. Fort Jefferson must be seen to be appreciated. Photos of it do it no justice because of its immense size. Snorkeling is possible if the wind is light and the water temperature suitable for you. By al means take this trip once in your lifetime.,"December 1, 2015",A must see.,18,"Punta Gorda, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Get ready for a beautiful adventure off the mainland! The ferry provides breakfast, lunch, and a terrific crew. Fort Jefferson is definitely a remote place of awe and inspiration. The perfect amount of time is given to view the fort and do a little snorkeling if you choose the self-guided tour instead of going with a group. I would highly recommend taking the ferry to Dry Tortugas. However, if the crew tells you that the seas are rough and a refund can be issued...believe them! We were given a great deal of warning before walking onto the boat. The crew was telling the absolute truth and had we had another day to reschedule the trip it would've been a better choice than to brave the rough seas.

My husband said the Tortugas is the best coral reef he has seen since Okinawa, Japan. This most recent trip became profoundly aware of some coral bleaching which we did not see the first time we made the trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,About a two hour boat ride to the Island but well worth it. The entire family went and the tour of the Fort was really great. They are working on shoring up this old Fort from further sea damage from the pounding waves.On the beach were several weird boats and I asked what these were and was told they were home boats people from Cuba built to get to America. I wondered how they could make the 90 mile trip and land at the fort without being caught. The ranger told me that they have been given orders that when they see a boat of illegal immigrant comming close they are to walk to the other side of the island so that they can land with dry feet. He said none of them would go against this as it is a order from Washington. Once the people land they then have to pull the boat above high tide water and then call immigration in Key West where they send a helico[pter out and pick them up. They are kept for a few days in an American Government Condo unit until they are taken to Miami for processing and given freedom.Plan on going swimming when you are at Dry Torugas as the water is just perfect. Clean and loaded with aquatic life to view. Great white sandy beach and pure salty green water.,"November 27, 2015",Great History Lesson,193,"Pensacola, FL",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was an excellent day trip for a sunny day and first time visit. The most interesting thing about the fort is just its existence. The beaches are fine but I wouldn't go there just to hang out on the beach. Snorkeling was pretty good but you need to know where to go. We are experienced divers and knew that (as shown on the map given out on the Yankee Freedom) the coral heads are about 100 yards off from the south swim beach in a NW direction (west of the fort). We were the only snorkelers way out there at the time, so I don't think most people realize where the reef is. All of the best diving and snorkeling sites in the larger multi-island park are not accessible from Garden Key, so you would have to come with your own boat or private charter. If you like birding, make sure to walk down the long sandy peninsula toward Bush Key. The dominant species in November was the Magnificent Frigatebird, A much more diverse population is evidently present in breeding season, about May.","November 25, 2015",A beautiful island with an interesting fort and birds,108,"Lynchburg, Virginia, United States",5

Went on a Friday and there were a large school trip on board with us but were no harm. We were staying in Islamorada so was a long day, left the hotel at 5am to get down to the ferry port by 7am. The ferry is 2 and a half hours to get to the Island, but you can have as much breakfast as you want which was more than satisfactory.When we got to the Island decided not to do the tour but to walk round ourselves, it is a big fort and quite interesting to find out more about it. Mad to think something that big with so many bricks was build 70 miles out at sea! Explored around and inside the fort, so beautiful to see the sea from inside and you can get some great pics.We had lunch on the ferry which again was nice enough, then picked up some snorkel gear and did some snorkelling.

After giving it a lot of thought we decided to risk it and set up out alarm to wake up at 5:30 am to make the 6:30 campers gear drop off, of is worth to mention that the night before our trip was super stormy, raring thunder and lightening. The day of the trip it was cloudy and a little rainy but the sea was not choppy so we had a smooth ride to the island. When we arrived to DTNP the sun was picking out thru the clouds because the storm had blown the other direction. The day changed to sunny and beautiful, the park rangers advised that we snorkeled in the morning when we got there because there was coming. The marine life was beautiful, the water was warm and clear, the snorkeling gear provided was very basic but in working condition. Some camping sited were fully sheltered by bushy trees and others were partially sheltered. We were on site one, just a few steps from the south beach of the island, that spot had trees in the back and the fort on the front, so we still had some air flow which was very much appreciated. This was the best night of sleep we have had in a long time. The crew at the yankee freedom were very knowledgable, helpful, and on top of every detail. They made the experience even better. Do not trust the weather forecast, go check it out by your self, who knows, you may get lucky and have a wonderful day (s) and if the weather is bad, the crew will tell you on the spot.

There is a nice beach area to take a dip and or catch some rays. There is also an option for outdoor enthusiast to camp and stay a night or two before you return to the Keys.

What you need to do is cancel by 3 PM the previous day (confirm this on your reservation) if you think the swells are going to be too much. You will spend 5 hours on the boat - it's beautiful in good weather. The staff were all very friendly. OK a few points to note:1. This is a concession (a private company that contracts with the NPS - this is very common)2. The boat staff did a raffle. The raffle is basically a way for staff to get tips (it doesn't support the park). We asked them about this and they told us. Just so you know...3. Tips are expected. In Key West - it now seems that tips are expected at nearly all attractions. They serve alcohol on the way back (cost) where you can tip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Combination review of Dry Tortugas NP and the Yankee Freedom III fast ferry boat from Key West to the island and return. ⬛️The boat and boat trip:▪️Weather was windy, warm, humid; no rain or lightning the entire day across 70 miles of blue water and return. Duration from 8 am push off to return was 9.5 hours. ▪️Sailing speed about 27 knots over the 70 miles to the island so a little less than 2.5 hours. The return was slightly longer as we drove the boat mainly into the wind and 4-7' waves. ▪️Breakfast and lunch served on the boat and was basic, cafeteria style. Mediocre quality and more healthy choices are needed. Fruit looked old. We got by just find. ▪️Boat seating was comfortable and there were a lot of empty seats around us in the main, lower cabin. We went outside and moved around a fair amount. ▪️Restrooms on the boat are adequate. ▪️The ride back was very bumpy. Some passengers took dramamine before hand. Several became seasick.⬛️Dry Tortugas NP▪️Small sandy-beach coral island (key) with picturesque blue-green waters around the islands and many birds. No turtles for us. ▪The walls of the red-brick ️Fort Jefferson dominate the small island. The fort was supposed to be for defense, however evolved into a prison. ▪️Union held the fort during the Civil War. After the war, Dr Samuel Mudd, who treated John Wilkes Booth was imprisoned there. Fair amount of Civil War linkage with the fort. ▪Guided free 45-minute tour of the fort offered at 11 and 1. Recommend. ▪️Picnic tables available....mainly in the sun. We had a quick lunch on board and took water out to a picnic table during our one hour of ""free time"". Better choice for us was to sit on the shaded grass inside the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,A superb trip to a beautiful and unique place. The trip is very well organised and the staff on the boat could not have been more welcoming. The food on board was excellent. Even if you don't snorkel you can see so much by walking around the moat and gazing into the crystal clear waters. I would recommend the walking tour around the Fort too.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a national treasure you must experience. The pictures simply do not do the island justice. If you can do it, arrive by sea plane. That is half of the adventure and so well worth it. You'll see all sorts of amazing sea formations and a few other neat surprises along the way. The fort itself is hauntingly beautiful. Take your time and explore, but linger on the top for the best views. If you are afraid of heights, you may not care for the dizzying but exciting walk around the perimeter on a foot carved path near the crumbling edge with no guardrail or safety devices. If you're an adventurist, you will love taking in the scenic views in peaceful serenity as the hot tropical wind howls past you. For my trip, the best part was the swimming with the fish on the natural beach. There were stingrays and all kinds of smaller, curious fish who enjoyed hiding among our legs and toes. quite possibly one of my most memorable and favorite trips. You will not be disappointed.","November 8, 2015",Exotic Fun Close By,77,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We have always talked about going but it is pricey $ 350.00 a couple. We got a coupon that saved us $50.00 and booked on-line. Well, this is well worth the price. Never thought about it, but the trip on the boat is great by its self, you are feed twice, breakfast and lunch, plus you have the Fort to visit and snorkeling gear is included. The sea was 3-4 feet and the crew prepared us for the trip, all was good due to them. Captain Meg is the greatest, she was there to help at a minutes notice. The Fort and the surrounding beach was beautiful. The history of the fort and the people that live there for the Park Service are amazing. I liked the South Beach to go snorkeling from, saw so many fish...Well worth devoting a day to. Check in is at 7 am returning is around 5:30 pm..

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I have been to the Dry Tortugas National Park twice now on the Yankee Freedom (first time on the II, second time on the III). The only bad thing is the price, which is a bit. The boat ride is long. 5 hours round trip, but you are also going out 70 miles west of Key West! This is actually America's most remote national park! Once you get out there though, the place is stunning. The water is crystal blue. The fort is the biggest brick structure in the Western hemisphere, and since it is no longer working, you can climb up to the roof for some great vistas. You can snorkel and swim off either beach, and you will want to most days as it can get quite hot in the fort. There isn't much coral to speak of, but there are usually a lot of barracuda and other fish like parrotfish around the old mooring lines. My first time, I was snorkeling in 4 feet of water with barracuda to my sides and pelicans dive-bombing from 30 feet up next to me. Last time I was there, I saw what must've been a 5 foot shark from the roof of the fort. That's how clear the water is. Yes, it's a long boat ride. Yes, it can be hot (it's the Florida Keys people!) There aren't any facilities on the island, but there is on the boat. The history is great and the water is beautiful and refreshing. I hope to camp there next time.","November 4, 2015","Excellent history, beautiful waters",31,"Cocoa Beach, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a place I have wanted to visit for a very long time. It was very much worth it. The cost is a little on the more expensive side. You have a 2.5 hr boat trip out and 2.5 hours back, but you can't beat the experience. I do wish the amount of time was longer, but it is what it is. You can take several different tours while you are there. Just know one covers the inside and the other covers the moat. If you were there for just the historical tours it would eat the time you have out there. You will learn a lot about the old fort. You can camp there. But you have to stay there for four nights. One thing are the hermit crabs. There are all over the camping area. Just remember what you take in you have to take out.There is plenty of beach on either side of the fort. There are all kinds of fish and coral. I saw a sting rey. You don't have to go far to see the fish either. If you are a strong swimmer you can swim out a distance and see lobster.The tour offers breakfast and lunch. You will get a good variety of food and plenty to eat. They offer on the ride back alcohol for purchase.This is a very interesting place to visit. The cannons are huge and cool to see. The money you pay helps with keeping the park and your experience.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"While well-removed from ""civilization"", the Dry Tortugas are an interesting part of the National Park system and worth the trip (by ferry or seaplane). The impressive fort (Fort Jefferson) occupies most of Garden Key and provides a glimpse at life in the late 1800s. A walk around the moat wall allows you to get a glimpse of various sea life, including cassiopeia (upside-down jellyfish), corals, and a wide range of tropical fish. Magnificent frigate birds nest on Long Key and masked and brown boobies may be spied on the pilings when entering the harbor. Snorkling provides underwater access to the wide variety of marine life in an easily accessible manner.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This review might be biased, since I have not visited too many sea(s) since I am not a fan of cruiser and cannot swimming. I took seaplane from key west. The sea off key west is beautiful, but no more. But, when we approaching the Dry Tortugas, the sea is astonishing. Let's say, I knew the sea could be beautiful, but I never know it could be that beautiful. It's like a door to a new world opened.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is a sanctuary. It is an amazing place and well worth the 2 hour expensive ferry ride. You won't regret it. Fort Jefferson itself is amazing, but the water and snorkeling is even better. The island is virtually untouched so the birds and the fish are not scared of humans so you really get to experience some unusual wild behavior. It was windy the day that we got to travel to Dry Tortugas so the visibility in the water wasn't great during snorkeling but we were still able to see fish, clams, large conch shells, sea urchins, jelly fish, and some other marine life. The water is beautiful and you definitely want to take your camera as the photo opportunities are abundant. I would not recommend this for the faint of heart though because the ferry ride can be bumpy (you could take a Dramamine) and the stairs at the fort are difficult to climb if you are elderly. About 20 people became seasick on the trip back to Key West so keep that in mind if that is something that you are prone too. Otherwise it's amazing and well worth the money. You can camp here if you want, but make sure to make arrangements in advance. It is very primitive. ","October 26, 2015",Breathtakingly Beautiful,11,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,We took the ferry to the fort on a day trip and are so glad that we did! We watched a beautiful sunrise on the ride there. We walked thru the fort on our own instead of taking the guided tour so we could enjoy it at our leisure. Words cannot describe the beautiful views from the top of the fort. The contrast of the green foliage and the amazing shades of blue in the ocean. The only disappointment was that the water was a little too cloudy to really see much while snorkeling but we still had a good time.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Unless you are an avid fan of forts, you collect every NPS stamp, or only go to secluded beaches, then the $175 per person fee for the ferry (and even more for a private sea plane) may not be worth it. The food quality and choices were adequate for a ferry, you won't be hungry. The scenery was very nice. The tours are informative. TIP: If you're prone to queasiness, then you'll want to sit on the top level. Be warned that the trip back to Key West is much bumpier than the ride to Dry Tortugas.But Key West has a lot to offer with some of the same turquoise blue waters...not as vibrant as Dry Tortugas, but still nice. Plus you don't have to commit to a 10-hour day (tours at 11am and 1pm help the day go by faster during the 4-hour break between boat rides). If you're on a budget, or prefer to spend your money on other area attractions, you can find a similar beach at Fort Zachary on Key West (and the fort has some similar interior architecture as Fort Jackson). Fort Pulaski in Southeast Georgia is more similar to Fort Jackson.","October 23, 2015","Beautiful Scenery, but...",329,"Orlando, Florida",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This all-day trip out by boat to the Dry Tortugas was truly the highlight of our trip to Key West. You start out very early -- 7 a.m., so get there on time. They leave on time. Once aboard, they serve a buffet style breakfast with toast, bagels, fresh fruit, yogurt, boiled eggs, cereal. Nothing elaborate, but certainly healthy and sufficient. There seems to be enough room on the boat for everyone to walk around, stand out on deck, circulate. There are three bathrooms at the front, and through the trip and back, they were kept very clean and stocked. A Park ranger accompanies the boat over and back, and he was available throughout the trip to answer questions. He was very knowledgeable about the fort, the surrounding keys, flora and fauna. Lunch is served before getting to the Tortugas. We made sandwiches and took them shore with us to eat after snorkeling. The snorkeling distribution went smoothly, with enough equipment for everyone. We snorkeled in several different spots, then ate lunch and took the fort tour. Three fort tours are offered at different times. There is a changing shack on the dock and an outdoor shower to get all the sand off. We rinsed out our bathing suits and changed in the change house. We did not have enough time to walk around the entire fort. There is a lot to do in the short four hours you have on the island.

I witnessed them go above and beyond their job titles to make sure each person on the boat was comfortable and had all they needed to have a safe wonderful experience throughout the entire trip. On arrival to the Dry Tortugas you can tour the fort, swim in the crystal blue ocean, snorkel or do it all. Also if prearranged you can camp at the Dry Tortugas.... That's my next trip plan :) Please don't miss this adventure at Key West. If you had to pick only one paid event while at Key West this would be the one to win. The memories we made on this adventure with be ones I will always treasure. It was mine and my friends first time snorkeling...and with the expert instructions from the crew member....

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Fort is very large and I would not call it handicap accessible or child friendly. This is a large historic structure that was obviously built prior to all accessible. Additionally there has been some decay over the years and there are area that are open for viewing that if you had a small rambunctious child could fall from a second floor or higher. I would suggest you leave the children on the mainland for this destination. There are interesting stories of the various eras of this Fort/Prison/National Park. They have a couple of boats on display from refugees that came across in the ""boats"" and landed at the Island. The National Park staff were all very friendly and helpful. The weather was not the best while we were there so the visibility in the water was not great. If you are traveling out specifically for the snorkeling pick your day carefully. I would suggest you use the free download information sheet to read ahead of time if you are trying to learn about the area. This is a small island mostly covered by a fort. We had 4 hours on the island which was perfect. If the weather was better I could see where more time for snorkeling may have been desirable. This has been a bucket list item for a long time.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This may be the least visited of all America's national parks, but certainly not because it is lacking in interest. Probably it is because you can't drive there: the fort and park are located a good number of miles to the west of where the highway ends in Key West, and so to get there you have a choice of a daily round-trip ferry service or a several times daily round-trip seaplane trip. Each option has its advantages, though if cost is a factor the ferry is definitely less expensive. Once at the park, it is well worth the time to walk the entire fort, both interior and exterior, to get a true sense of its dimensions and its role in history. A number of helpful interpretive displays help in this. The park is also an excellent place for bird watching, especially during migration seasons, and there are good snorkeling opportunities in the waters just off the beaches which surround the fort. This is an excellent way to spend a day.","October 19, 2015",Don't miss this if you come to Key West!,57,"Salem, Oregon",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This fort is about 60 miles from Key West. One can only get there by boat or float plane. We took the float plane option, a Cessna Caravan. I don't think the plane ever went much more than a couple hundred feet in the air. Take a late morning flight and pack your bathing suite. The fort shows its age, but sun. salt, surf are more abrasive than sandpaper. There is a nice swimming area and the water is as crystal clear as one could imaging. There aren't a lot of places for birds to hang out here, so there is a lot of reminders on everything of the birds presence here. Plenty of old cannons and stories about the forts past, primarily for Union forces controlling shipping lanes into the Gulf of Mexico.

They had all kinds of adventure the night before we arrived. A boat with 21 Cuban refugees landed there in a small wooden dingy the night before we got there (confirmed by the rangers on duty)! Worth taking one of the tours around the fort or moat (we took the marine life tour and Ranger Mike really knows his sea life!). Uneventful return trip - lunch was fresh (make your own sandwiches).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My family of 4 adults took the Yankee Freedom cruise to visit the Tortugas National Park. Its a pricey tour but we felt it was the highlight of our Key West trip. The boat crew was first rate, and worked every minute to assure a safe cruise over the 70 miles between Key West and the park keys. They found a pod of leaping dolphins and thrilled us by circling while we watched the dolphins race and jump. Both breakfast and lunch are served, and the food is tasty, healthy, and abundant. The crew thoroughly briefed all the deep sea divers, scuba divers, and swimmers aboard on the areas in which to swim, where good sites are for exploration, and safety matters. There was equipment aboard to use. The tour of the fort is conducted by park rangers. They were outstanding! There was a tour of the moat, discussing its construction and the vegetation and sea life there. A second tour of the fort--just WOW. My brother and I are history buffs, and the Ranger covered the design, construction details, daily life of the soldiers, various buildings, design and purpose of the cannons and fortifications, history of the prisoners, Dr. Mudd, Spanish American War, and so much more. There was no question he was unable to answer. Most of the fort looks as it did during the Civil War. I found the woman who runs the souvenir shop quite knowledgable as well. Clearly the guides respect and honor the history they represent. It is several days later and we are still talking about this tour. Learned a great deal and are inspired to read more about its history. Tips: comfortable walking shoes. Must be able to climb several flights of stairs and walk uneven terrain. It can be very hot and it is wise to carry a lot of water, available on the ship and on the dock. Ship is air conditioned in the dining area. This would be tough for someone with mobility issues and I cant imagine a child under 8 or 9 enjoying themselves.

Considering the weather forecast - it would have been better if they cancelled the trip that day. There is not a whole lot to do except snorkeling and visiting the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I'm an avid Diver and Snorkeler. My husband and I went on this tour because we understood the snorkeling was fantastic. Not so on the day we went. The weather was a bit iffy so we took that into consideration, but we just weren't all that impressed with what we saw underwater. Could have seen the same in the Keys, saved the 5-6 hours of boat travel on a ferry with a bunch of people waiting in line for a very average breakfast and lunch... and the $140 each we paid for the trip.Guide was great, very personable, ferry was comfortable... however tables are set up for 6 or so. If you are a couple, you will be sitting with others, which is fine if you like to meet new people... we met great folks going and coming. Breakfast is cold cuts, cereal, fruit and some eggy potato salad concoction. Lunch is cold cuts, chips, bread and soda. Cash bar on way back. Fort is an empty brick structure with lots of wear and tear damage. There are plugged up cannons around the top of the 3 stories. The views from the fort are of ocean in every direction. Dr. Mudd's cell is just a hint of what it was... a space much like the rest of the fort that is notated as once being his cell.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Although the trip out to Dry Tortugas is 2 1/2 hours, it is an interesting ride, as you get to see many smaller islands on the way. The ferry is large and comfortable, with plenty of seating, both outside and in air conditioned comfort indoors. It was a nice touch that the price included breakfast, as the ferry left early.There are a couple of large parking garages right across the street from the ferry terminal, so you will have no trouble with parking being overcrowded.The island itself is very beautiful, and the old Civil War fort juxtaposed against the intense clear blue of the ocean is a perfect opportunity photographers. Touring the fort was very cool as well, as it was so strange to see a structure like this in such a remote location, 70 miles from Key West.There was good snorkeling, particularly on the back side of the fort, where less visitors go, and about 100 yards out from shore, where the quality of the coral was very good.Lunch is served on the ferry, as no food is available on the island.This is an incredible day trip, and it should be a must when you are in Key West. It is definitely one of the country's most unique national parks, and the contrast of the natural beauty of the island and ocean with the stark lines of the fort are a photographers delight.","October 6, 2015",Well Worth the Trip,53,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

The boat was fairly comfortable although a little hard to maneuver in and out of tables. Breakfast spread was more than adequate with many options. The trip over to the park/fort and back was a delight as fish, birds, and sea turtles abounded. Once at the fort, the tour, distribution of snorkel gear, and lunch back on the boat were also well organized. Our boat guide conducted the fort tour as no one from the park service was available, and he did a good job. My husband and I love visiting historical sites, and this did not disappoint. It was great to be able to snorkel right from the sandy beach. Fish were visible even without snorkel gear, as the water is calm and crystal clear. The lunch spread was also more than adequate. I was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable cost of mixed drinks ($5) and beer ($3) on the trip. All of the boat staff were friendly and helpful. Being able to rinse off the salt water in an outdoor shower on the deck before going to the changing area on the dock was a definite plus. The trip overall is a wonderful day activity for families.

You taxi right up to the beach, and haul your day trip gear over to a picnic table. We toured Ft. Jefferson first; it might be the best example of a historic fort in the U.S. You are free to explore all three levels of the fort. If you have small children, you MUST hang onto them; there are plenty of edges that you could fall from! The curved stairways that go to 2nd and 3rd floors are amazing. The masonry craftsmanship is top notch, there are over 16 million bricks in this fort. The visitor center is fairly small but has a nice souvenir selection. There are two beaches you can snorkel from; select the beach with the calmest waters. There are old pilings from the docks; the coral and fish in this area were amazing. Be sure to check out the riveted steel lighthouse, it is very cool. Here are some travel tips: take hats, suntan lotion, water shoes, snacks with you. The sand walkways are ok for barefoot, but the grassy areas have small spurs that will stick in your foot. Both the seaplane and ferry will provide you with snorkel gear. The ferry trip includes breakfast and lunch in your ticket cost. I wish that I had purchased a disposable underwater camera to use while I snorkeled.

The journey is not too interesting, i got bored, however once you reach the island, its the beginning of an awesome experience. take your snorkel gear, its all included in the price for the ride on the freedom ferry, and go on the left side of the fort, that is where you have loads of fish. The fishes are numerous, blue, yellow, large, small, colorful big fin, small fin, hovering under you, hovering besides you. we even saw barracudas and nurse sharks. keep moving towards the old pier on that side of the island, there are more fishes.

We got a great breakfast on board and then went out to watch dolphins, turtles and other sea life as we traveled to the National Park. We also got to hear from Ranger Mike and Tour Guide Jeff along the way, as they told us about what we were seeing and what we were yet to see. It was a great start to our visit!Once at Fort Jefferson we took the 11:00 tour with guide Jeff. He was one of the most awesome tour guides we've ever had! His love for this place is infectious and he even made Mrs. M enjoy the history lessons. AWESOME!We went back on the Yankee Freedom for a great lunch and then back out to explore. You can snorkel using the gear provided or your can bring your own. Instead, we walked the moat around the fort and got to see an incredible diversity of sea life: barracuda, tarpon, parrot fish, coral, sea fans, and more more more! Mrs. M doesn't like to snorkel so this was an incredible opportunity for her to see all the fish and sea creatures.Promptly at 2:45 we left Ft. Jefferson and headed back to Key West. There were still dolphins, turtles and flying fish to see, but many on the boat slept. Not us!Don't forget to bring sunscreen, hats and sunglasses.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the ferry - Yankee Freedom - to the island, it's the only way to get there unless you have your own sea worthy vessel. The ride over takes around 2 and 1/2 hours, the staff on the boat give you lots of history and they serve a great breakfast on the way and lunch is served on the boat during the time it is docked. We took both the moat tour and the fort tour - both worthwhile and very informative. If you are day tripping between the tours and lunch this will take all your time. The campsites were nice and the snorkling looked amazing. There is an island about 3 miles from tortuga with a lighthouse on it. The ferry will bring your kayak for an extra fee and the guide reported a wreck just off the tip of loggerhead island that is a snorkelers dream. There is also a coral reef if you look out toward loggerhead island it is positioned between two white buoys. If you like primitive camping, kayaking and snorkling an overnight trip here is the thing for you.

If you burn easily, bring high powered waterproof sunscreen to apply all over (multiple times) & wear a UV t-shirt while you snorkel to avoid getting a bad sunburn on your back (most of our group had bad burns, but I had the shirt on).

After going to Ford's Theater in Washington, DC and reading several books about the Lincoln assignation and Dr. Samuel Mudd I had to see Fort Jefferson where he had been incarcerated. The rangers were very knowledgeable, they welcomed questions, and seemed just a tad lonely. They knew all about Dr. Mudd and helped ""close the circle"" on my education. The trip out and back was on a fast catamaran with open decks as well as inside air conditioning, your choice. The trip included breakfast on the way out, lunch on board while moored at the front entrance, and free snorkel equipment to use while there.

While the 2.5 hour boat trip there is somewhat long, it was filled with information from tourguide Ryan. Breakfast and lunch are provided, and really very satisfactory considering you are on a ferry boat. Once we arrived, we took a walk around Fort Jefferson on the moat. Interesting to get a feel for the size of the fort and to see some wildlife (fish) in the water. Had a GREAT tour of the fort with Ryan. He is VERY knowledgeable and easy to listen to and understand. Fort Jefferson has quite a rich history!After the tour and a quick lunch, we went to the beach for snorkeling and swimming. My hubby did more snorkeling and was pleased with the fish he saw. We had been told by Ryan about the one CROCODILE that lives there...and we saw him several times! He seemed completely unfazed by the swimmers as he trolled from the moat across the beach and around the old docks and back a few times. My husband was snorkeling just 10 yards from one of his surprise appearances! He did swim quite quickly to move away!All in all, it was a wonderful day....once there, it was up to us to choose what to do with our time.

The walk around the perimeter of the Fort was informative not only about the Fort itself, but about the wildlife in the moat and outside the walls. There is no shade, so plan accordingly. The tour of the Fort and it's grounds, led by the same ranger later in the day, was interesting and informative. Both tours were just over an hour each and leave time for lunch and a quick snorkel between tours. The waters are crystal clear and snorkeling with barracuda, lieutenant tang and clown fish (just to name a few) is so enjoyable because the waters are so calm.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It is not easy getting to Dry Tortugas National Park which is why I gave it that title. First you have to get to Key West and then take a ferry boat ride that lasts about 2 1/2 hours each way for a total of 5 hours of your day. The cost is quite expensive $170 per person so you really must want to go here to go to the trouble and expense.I really wanted to go, so we did, on a hot, hot August day. The weather was perfect, no rain, barely a cloud, and flat, calm water.The ferry service was excellent. We were served a breakfast and lunch buffet which were free and included in our fare. Both had a variety of foods so most people would find something they enjoyed. There was a cooler filled with water to drink and plenty of coffee. On the return trip, there were alcoholic beverages available for purchase. At that point, with the heat index being over 100 degrees, I really enjoyed the frozen margarita I had.The ferry was air conditioned and had plenty of restrooms. The only problem I could see with the ferry, was that the seating was tight with the tables in between. It was difficult to get seated unless you were on the end of a row. Our ferry was at capacity and we made our reservations on line about 5 days before the trip. I would definitely get tickets before hand as this is a popular trip. At the park, you will see Fort Jefferson and go snorkeling. The day we were there, there were folks dressed in Civil war period costumes giving tours of the fort. They were knowledgeable and interesting to listen to. I do not know if they are there every day but I am glad they were there when I went as they made the tour spectacular. We walked around the moat and the water was so clear you could see plenty of fish without even putting on a snorkel. The two beaches were beautiful although it was hot. Snorkel gear was available through the ferry line, no extra cost, or you could bring your own. There were a few moon jelly fish in the water and one person got stung. The crew was ready with a remedy so that was well planned. Many people snorkeled, though, and the jellies were not a problem. I'm very glad I went but I don't think I'll ever be back because of the difficulty getting here. I do not recommend this trip for people with children younger than 12 years. Sure, some people took children, but it really is a long, long boat ride in a very confined space. There are so many other things for children to enjoy, other beaches in other places, this is not one I would take them to.","September 1, 2015",Once in a Lifetime Trip,98,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5

A round trip ticket that typically includes lunch and drinks, free snorkeling equipment as well as a free tour of Fort Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas, runs anywhere from $170 to $190 bucks a person. Yes, I know that seems VERY pricey...but you're traveling 70 miles south of Key West and getting to see some absolutely spectacular scenery on the way to your destination. The trip is just a little over two hours, it really depends on weather. I highly recommend taking the Yankee Freedom. Beautiful boat, wonderul staff and a nice, smooth trip. Once you've arrived at the Dry Torgutas, there's plenty to do and see, but you've got a lot to fit into the 5 hours you're on land! Park rangers are typically on hand and are fountains of knowledge pertaining to the fort, its history and the waters that surround it. Some of the BEST snorkeling you will ever have the opportunity to partake in is located right here at the fort. We encountered plenty of amazing sealife! If you enjoy nature and history, this trip is something you have to add to your bucket list. Overnight camping is available, but it's a complete pack in/pack out situation. This means whatever you need, you have to bring it with you, fresh water included! Camping slots sell out quickly and are extremely limited, so book early. Don't forget to pack dry clothes, sunscreen and a camera...and if you find that you tend to get a little seasick, some Dramamine isn't a bad idea either. There are a lot of different ways to spend a large amount of cash while your visiting the Keys. Again, despite the high dollar ticket price, this adventure is one that you'll never forget...do not miss it!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Great day trip! They also have camping, though there is no fresh or running water on the island so you'll need to bring your own. We took the ferry rather than the seaplane. It's less costly, yes, but we enjoyed the trip itself. In addition, you get a lot more time at the park if you take the ferry and the ferry ride includes a meal. Ft. Jefferson is an amazing place to visit and there's lots of history to explore.","September 1, 2015",Spend the day!,19,"Blue Springs, Missouri",5

There is no cell reception, water, electricity, or restrooms (restrooms and meals located on ship) at the park. Plan to disconnect and enjoy this once in a lifetime experience. You are also able to camp there if you so desire! This is an all day trip 7am-5pm and a 2.5 hour trip out there and back! ","August 29, 2015",Trip of a lifetime!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I arrived at the park via seaplane (another wonderful experience) and we truly enjoyed the wondrous views and hearing about the park's rich history. We did some snorkeling and as luck would have it, we saw a manatee within 10 yards of us - one hadn't been seen in years until the week we arrived there. It was a bit pricey but another reason why my husband and I love the Florida Keys - a must see attraction!!FYI - there are bathroom facilities on the island, but they are closed when the ferry is docked so you must use the one inside the ferry.","August 28, 2015",Breathtaking,23,"Frederick, Maryland",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is one of those ""bucket list"" items that must be experienced. While the price isn't cheap, it proved well worth it. The trip, 70 miles from Key West aboard the Yankee Freedom III lasts about 2 and a half hours. Reservations are a must as the ship only carries so many passengers. A nice breakfast is served and helps pass the time. There is also a narration as you traverse the green and blue waters. We passed a salvage ship which was scouring the sea bed for sunken treasure. Once docked at Fort Jefferson on the Dry Tortugas, you're faced with a choice of bathing or snorkeling in the warm waters, snorkeling gear provided, joining a limited tour of the fort with a guide from the ship, or exploring on your own. We opted for the tour conducted by our guide Ryan and were not disappointed. He was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly, taking time to answer all questions with great patience. After the tour, it was back to the boat for a nice lunch after which we took a dip in the crystal clear waters. At about 2:45 it was time to start the return journey. We enjoyed ourselves very much and are only sorry it took us so long to make the trip.","August 28, 2015",A Great Ride and Histoic Visit,197,"Port Charlotte, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wow! What a place, what a place! This is such a paradise! The waters are crystalline, clear and loads of fishes to see with a snorkel. We camped there for two nights, we had fans and we managed thru the night, otherwise without fans it would have been difficult to sleep, it was I'm the middle of August and very hot, but worth the experience. When the ferry is there, you can buy some basic things, like water and food. We saw the local. Crocodile that lives there, a scorpion fish, many rainbow fishes, and a sting ray. I definitely come back one day, but perhaps would come when the temperatures aren't so hot.","August 26, 2015",Paradise,93,"Gumpoldskirchen, Austria",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the ferry to Dry Tortugas National Park. The ferry was air conditioned and provided breakfast on the 2.5 hour ride out to the fort. It was an easy ride and there was plenty of seating and restrooms. Breakfast was bagels, cereal and fruit. It was a very nice spread for a ferry. When we reached the island we walked the fort while the crew got the snorkeling gear ready. The fort was AMAZING! You can take a guided tour but we opted not to do it. We swam out to the coral reef and the snorkeling was really good. Lots of types of coral and a great variety of tropical fish. Moon jellies were the only downfall. We swam back for lunch on the ferry. It was cold cuts, chicken salad, and peanut butter but the bread was delicious and there was fresh lettuce and tomatoes. They also served potato salad, fruit salad and cookies. You could purchase beverages, water was provided. You could also purchase hot dogs, burgers, and other items. After lunch we went back out and snorkeled a different area around the fort. They provided you with a map of all the great areas for snorkeling. At 2:00 pm the bar opened. The ferry left the island at 3:00 pm. On the way back to Key West dolphins were racing the boat. It was so cool! I highly recommend this trip. Trip is $170 for an adult and $125 for children. Well worth it. Just bring tip money!","August 26, 2015",Best Day in the Keys!,21,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My goal was to visit Dry Tortuguas while in Key West. Mission accomplished. The time spent at the fort was interesting and informative. The snorkeling not so much. I was expecting more but for swimming, it was good. It is a little pricey for the amount of time allotted on the key itself. The ferry is 2.5 hours over and 2.5 hours back. But I can say I've been there","August 25, 2015",Not a place everyone goes,65,"Conroe, Texas",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Checked this off my bucket list. Yankee Freedom experience was excellent. Went on a picture perfect hot August day. Jeff our adorable tour guide was very professional, knowledgable, and passionate about preserving this unique marine environment. Smooth sailing so no chance of sea sickness. Fort itself is a ridiculous example of the excess of war but what an amazing ruin to explore for a day. Wish I had brought my dslr because all the windows to the sea make it a photographer's dream. I couldn't get my mask just right but snorkeling is a must. Jeff was right, the wall of the fort was the best place. Even though there's no way I wanted to camp for the night, I'm rethinking that because the thought of seeing one sunset, the starry night, and one sunrise on the island is calling to me now. Flying fish and rum punch on the ride back was icing on the cake of my sister's birthday bucket list check off. ","August 25, 2015",Bucket List,4,"Palm Beach Gardens, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was a phenomenal experience and what I've heard many describe as once in a lifetime. The island is absolutely beautiful with white sand and clear water. The leave nothing, take nothing policy ensures that the island stays clean and preserves this amazing location for generations to come. We saw a variety of fish and birds that we had never seen in the wild. There were a ton of jelly fish and we were both stung numerous times but we really didn't care. We were so excited nothing would have stopped us from being in the water. So... there are some things you should know, that are purely FYI. We do not any anyway regret our trip and will absolutely go again. The boat ride is very long, very crowded, very boring, and very noisy. Especially the return trip. When we go again we will bring our own snorkel gear. The boat provides it but keep in mind it is used everyday and was mediocre to begin with. My wife and I both had to return to the boat to swap out our gear as it failed in the water and your time is very limited on the island. We both ended up with what appeared to be children's snorkels which resulted in numerous unsavory drinks from the ocean. There is very little shade on the island so come prepared. You will only get a few hours on the island and it goes fast. You may have to decide what you are most interested in, touring the fort or snorkeling. We arrived on the island at 10:30 and were required to be back on the boat by 2:45 so they can be underway by 3:00. It takes the staff about 15-20 mins to set up the snorkel gear and lunch is served at 11:00. So, we finally hit the beach about 11:30. We spent the entire time snorkeling and started to pack up around 2:00. By the time we got back to the boat it was a struggle for us to find 2 seats together as many people decide to place bags on adjacent seats or tell you that seats are taken by others in their party that never seem to show up. Once again, it is an amazing place to visit and we will go again. Don't miss this trip. It is well worth the expense and any negatives you may encounter. ","August 24, 2015",What An Experience!,7,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"No one ever mentions that Dry Tortugas is one of the best birding destinations in the Americas due to its location in the gulf. During migration periods it is a resting place for all kinds of unique birds. I wondered why the concessions were renting binoculars and I soon got my answer. Upon entering the fort for the tour, I saw exhausted birds lying all over the place. Most were unusual migrants I had never seen before. In the courtyard of the fort was a water fountain with all kinds of birds voraciously drinking. Avid birders had their scope set up and were telling me what the unidentifiable birds were.  Although I missed the fort tour, I had plenty of time to snorkel the whole way around the island through clouds of fish. Because the boobies nest on the small neighboring islands, supposedly the fish are attracted to the area by the excrement. The plethora of birds and fish may be dependent on the time of year. We were there late spring/early summer several years ago. You may want to inquire about this if you are an avid birder. We're planning to go back early Oct for fall migration.","August 21, 2015",top birding spots,6,PA,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is one of the most awe-inspiring historical sites I have visited. The informational signage is very helpful and visitors were free to explore the old fort at will. Our teenage grandsons were fascinated by the tracks that moved the cannon, the magazine, and the foundry. I couldn't help but reflect on the desolation the solders and prisoners must have felt while being in 'residence' on this tiny key 70 miles from Key West. It was interesting to read that they amused themselves in pretty creative ways with musicals and plays. Their presence is still very much felt. It is a photographers' dream and we are so grateful for the work to restore and preserve this unique national treasure. The boys later enjoyed the snorkeling in the crystal clear water off the pristine beach and only the threat of a sudden thunderstorm forced them out of the water. They compared what they saw snorkeling as being equal to what they saw the previous day while scuba diving. The Yankee Freedom made the day trip comfortable and enjoyable, though a little crowded.","August 20, 2015",Historic and impressive,65,"Denton, Tx",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were really hoping to do some snorkeling and were disappointed by the large number of jellyfish. We are beginners and not comfortable navigating the jellyfish and we were not the only ones who felt this way. A lot of other people said the same thing. Considering the very high cost of the trip, I think they should be a little more informative about the conditions instead of just taking our money and not warning us what we are in for.Other than that, the water was very beautiful, fort very interesting, birding was very cool, weather was very hot. Walking around the fort on the moat wall was very nice.I am not sorry we went but I am not sure I would recommend this trip to others. You spend more time on the boat than on the island. Boat trip not so great due to crowds, screaming kids, uncomfortable seats, so-so food, long lines, etc. Best thing to do is stand outside at front of boat with the wind and enjoy view of open water/horizon.","August 20, 2015",Disappointed about jellyfish,4,"Landenberg, Pennsylvania",4

The only things to do there are snorkel and tour Fort Jefferson, the first of which I did not enjoy at all. Firstly, the snorkeling equipment provided was gross; I found a curly hair in my swim mask and my husband found a booger in his. Then I had difficulty snorkeling because, no matter how tight my swim mask was, water would keep leaking in and burning my eyes. The fins were also cumbersome so, needless to say, I returned the equipment and spent the rest of my time either on the boat or in the fort. The fort was neat to look around but that took up only 30 minutes. Unless you bring your own snorkeling gear and/or have an affinity for snorkeling, I wouldn't recommend going to the Dry Tortugas.

You do have to take a ferry, a seaplane, or your own boat (if you should be so lucky!) to get there, but it is well worth the trip. We did a 1/2 day seaplane trip, which gave us about two and a half hours on the island. We snorkeled for just over an hour, leaving about an hour to explore Fort Jefferson. Both activities were fantastic! Dry Tortugas is one of the least visited national parks in the country for obvious reasons. But I highly suggest you make the effort to see this incredible place.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"if you love to snorkel, this is a fantastic day trip. First the pros: the reef at the north docks ( turn right when coming off the boat) was breathtaking. An incredible amount of fish and coral and all just a short swim from shore. It made for great pictures. Snorkeling equipment is included though we brought our own. The boat had freshwater rinsing stations for the end of the day and there were changing rooms on the island. There was nice beach on the far side of the island and we would recommend that for smaller children or for getting a tan. The cons: it's an incredibly long boat ride for such a short time on the island. The boat transits the seventy miles in 2.5 hours (5 hours round trip) for a stay that's lasts only four hours. Although breakfast and lunch served aboard was convenient, we were not impressed with the quality or selection. The seats were also rather uncomfortable. Make sure to get there early for an indoor seat on hot days. Also be sure to plan your time while on the island. We started at the far beach which the map provided seems to indicate had the best snorkeling, it was disappointing. Spend your time at the north docks. It was also frustrating that the wifi provided to download the app for a private tour was down.

We had a wonderful guided tour of the fort but you can also do a self guided tour or just go into the beautiful water for swimming and snorkeling. If you plan on spending time in Key West, you should definitely book a trip to the Dry Tortugas. It was a really great day. Bring water shoes for the beach as the sand is very rocky. Snorkeling is great and better on the north beach. Highly recommended.","August 11, 2015",A great day trip from Key West,228,Pennsylvania,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I went to Key west for our Honeymoon and while both of us are ""History nerds"" we decided we wanted to take the trip to the Dry Tortugas. This was the best choice of the whole trip. The boat ride was a little early but well worth it. The boat ride heading out is great, relaxing and spacious to spread out and be comfortable. The two hour ride has a tour guide to talk about some history and explain what to do on the island. It was a beautiful day so the ride out was relaxing, once we got there we got to explore the fort ourselves with a walking tour and a self guided map. This is nice because you can go at your own pace, take as many pictures from on top of the fort as you want and enjoy a relaxing stroll around what is the coolest national park we have ever been to. When we were finished there is time to hang on the beach or go snorkeling which we did. She does not snorkel but I went and got to snorkel to the coral reef, see tropical fish, and explore ocean life in crystal clear water. It was an amazing experience!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had a great time at the Tortugas!I highly recommend going there, it is truly a beautiful place, and if you have the opportunity to go there do not turn it down. There are tons of reviews on the dry tortugas so I'm just going to be just offer a few tips. 1) Get there early in the morning (nlt 7:00), and when boarding starts try to get a seat on one of the side aisle tables. 2) If you plan to snorkel, the whole moat wall is a great place, but wait until 12:00 because the sun will be higher and the colors pop out better. Do one of the coaling dock areas first. 3) Eat breakfast before you board and pack a lunch. The breakfast on the ship is a bit lame, its basically cold bagels, soggy fruit and hard boiled eggs. The lunch is bread, cold cuts, chips and cookies. I wish we would have packed a lunch because it would have been better and quicker. I felt we lost a half hour of beach/snorkel time because we ate lunch at the ship. 4) Total island time is only 4.5 hours and you're going to want to be time efficient, because there is so much to see and do. 5) The boat ride is long, if you are prone to any sea sickness, prepare appropriately. It's a big boat but still rolls. 6) We brought a small 3x5 raft, I'm glad we did as it gave us something to snorkel with instead of a buoyancy vest. They kept it on the back of the boat for us. I recommend going to the tortugas, but be prepared to shell out a good bit of money and to prepare for 5 hours on a boat. If you are on a tight budget there are lots of things to do in the keys for less. I'm glad we had the opportunity to go to the Tortugas and I hope to camp there someday.","August 9, 2015",Tortugas (Via the Ferry),30,"Sarasota, Florida",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Very unique, fun snorkeling around the fort and knowing not everyone has done it made it even more exciting. Boat ride was fun but a little long at 2.5 hours.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The only thing that kept me from giving this experience 5 stars is the price and the LONG boat ride it takes to get here (2 hours and 15 minutes in each direction). There were many schools of fish near the coral heads (swim towards Loggerhead Lighthouse from the beach). My son saw huge tarpon. It was a little creepy to swim through the coal pilings, but again, all the fish seemed to be hiding out here! The crew of the boat serves a decent breakfast and lunch and the bar opens at 2.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom III ferry to the Dry Tortugas. The ride is about 2.5 hours but goes quickly. I have written a separate review of the YF III. The Dry Tortugas and Fort Jefferson is pretty impressive. It is a huge brick structure (16 million bricks!) that is surrounded by a moat and has two beach areas. For those who want to rough it, you can also arrange to camp on the island. I was perfectly fine with the day trip! It was also super hot, so I might have over done it with all the water I brought, but better safe then sorry. The National Park Service and Yankee Freedom tour guide both run tours of the fort. We decided to do a self guided walk of the fort to maximize beach and snorkeling time, but the it is definitely worth taking a walk around the fort and also the moat wall. The moat wall (less than a mile walk) is great to see the sea life from the surface (fan corals, zebra fish, tarpons, barracudas, etc). You would have to hold young kids by the hand, especially since its not advisable to be in the actual moat (hot water and stinging jelly fish). After our fort tour, we hit the south beach with our snorkel gear and went out to the coaling area. Depending on the waves and how experienced you are with snorkeling (admittedly we're not experts), it can be a bit tough to navigate with young kids. The coaling areas were pretty great to explore with lots of sea life. On the right side of the south beach, there were a lot of corals that developed along the moat wall and that a great area to snorkel as well. TIP: if you're sensitive to sun, bring a beach umbrella. There is no shade on the beach except for two trees. We did bring a beach blanket but spent most of the time in the water so didn't feel we needed the umbrella. You can actually swim all along the moat wall between south and north beaches) and while we did not do that, I would suggest it as even seeing the corals from the moat wall walk we should have spent more time there. We did not do the north beach, as it was smaller and looked more crowded, but there were more fish over there, including large tarpon. TIP: there are no restrooms at the fort so use the restrooms on the YF before you get off the boat to save yourself a walk back. Its not a long walk but in the hot day, it saves you some time. The fort does have a small National Park gift shop and some small exhibits. We felt like we had enough time to explore the fort and snorkel so it was a great day at Ft. Jefferson. We were glad to finally make it out to the Dry Tortugas. ","August 4, 2015","Great, but hot, visit to the Dry Tortugas",45,"Ellicott City, Maryland",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Two hours on a boat to get to an island that has no water, no electricity and is hotter than hades in the summer? Yes, please. In fact, it was a highlight of our trip to Key West!Our family of four arrived bleary eyed to the ferry check-in at 7am after first parking at the covered parking garage across the street. We had made our reservations on line and check-in was a breeze. I was a bit nervous and kept humming the theme song to ""Gilligans Island,"" but within minutes, felt right at ease. We received a mini-tutorial about what to expect (""take caution and do not overload the toilets"" was a big talking point, and with good reason. The only restrooms are on the boat and with close to 200 people, WE NEED THEM ALL) and then we boarded ""the vessel"" (that's boat talk) and began our trip. The trip includes admission into the park, as well as breakfast and lunch. The ferry was clean and comfortable and we were given information throughout as to what we were seeing outside our windows. There were even sea turtle sightings. Not by me, of course; I always miss these things, but sea turtles were spotted. We arrived at the island and were given the option to take one of two guided tours through Fort Jefferson or walk-through on our own. We chose the latter because the waters around the fort begged to be snorkeled immediately. Snorkel gear was provided at no charge allowing us to become one with the colorful sea life. After a break for lunch, we wondered through Fort Jefferson, marveling at how anyone managed to live there wearing anything more than a tank top and shorts. Long sleeves in THIS weather? How did that even happen? Who thought this was a GOOD idea?Before long, it was time to leave. We reboarded to find the crew had completely cleaned and vacuumed the entire cabin and someone was hard at work repairing a restroom. (SOMEONE clearly did not listen to the tutorial. THIS Is why we can't have nice things, people) Now, I had taken Dramamine on the trip TO the Dry Tortugas (if you forget to bring it, as I did, no worries-they have it available for purchase) but the ride was so smooth and calm, I probably didn't need it. On the return trip, I forgot to take it. Why? Because cocktails and wonderful frozen drinks were made available. Hmmmm….Vodak or Dramamine? Which should I take? Yeah, that's a no-brainer. The crew was exceptional: friendly, courteous, informative and even passed out comment cards to assess everyone's experience. It was a terrific value, and for an entire day's entertainment, well worth the money spent. And did I mention the cocktails? xoxo","August 3, 2015",Was Afraid It Would Turn Into Gilligan's Island…But It was Fan-Flippin-Tastic!,13,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Fort was awesome in person. The photos cannot adequately convey the magnitude of it. As it comes into view you cannot help but be impressed by its enormity and seclusion so far from anything else in the Gulf. We can't imagine what it would have been like to construct. The Fort was impressive and our tour guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The snorkeling, however, was not worth the 2.5 hour boat ride. We did see some massive tarpon but visibility in the water seemed to diminish by the minute. We expected more coral and sea life besides what was clinging to the moat wall.

Next, breakfast was already set up as we boarded the boat. The ride was very calm, but I understand that this is completely contingent upon nature. The lunch was more than enough and had a variety of options. The crew, the rangers, the guide were all remarkable. Unfortunately, there was a lack of seating in the air conditioned section of the catamaran because some people believe that their bags and feet deserve seats over other people.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"For a history buff and a marveler of tax payer wasted money, Ft. Jefferson is intriguing. I won't share much history so as not to spoil the visit, but a noted historical story includes that of the imprisonment of Dr. Mudd, whom attended to Mr. Booth's medical needs after Mr. Booth's assassination of President Lincoln. The fort itself is an impressive size, encompassing the majority of the little island. It's surrounding moat, with a constant flow of seawater makes for a good fortress, and an inviting snorkel area, but I don't think it's allowed. Plus, there was a story going around that there is a salt water croc that lives in there! There is a sand pathway on the roof of the fort that is open for visitors to walk, and that is a must, as the view of the sapphire and torquiest waters is magnificent. You'll want comfy footwear, our flip flops were fine. Of course it's hot, dress appropriately and bring water. We saw both modes of transportation, ferry and seaplane, that brings visitors straight from Key West and back. There is a little gift shop, but nothing else, no food, vending, etc. Our traveling group went by private boat and moored in the cove. The night view of the dome of stars is spectacular. We had five goliath groupers under our boat waiting for fish carcasses. Wow, they were huge! There is also wonderful snorkeling all around the fort, some accessible by beach entry, others by boat.

Dry Tortugas National Park,We took a seaplane out to the Dry Tortugas. It was a beautiful flight - very scenic. We got there ahead of the ship that brings tourists to the island. We took the morning flight so we had the island to ourselves. It was beautiful. The water is crystal clear. There was not much to see as far as snorkling but we tried. There was not much colorful coral nor colorful fish. We still had a wonderful time. We would definitely go again. We took our children - 8 and 9.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Once in a life time experience. This National Park is considered one of the most difficult to reach, but it is all worth it. There are two commercial options on getting there, a ship that serves breakfast and lunch, or the seaplanes. The planes cost more but are worth it if in your budget. They arrive early in the morning before the boat does, thus, the ten plane passengers have the island/fort to themselves. Consider it a half-day excursion by plane, or a full-day trip if taking the boat. The snorkeling is wonderful, both plane and boat provide mask,snorkel and fins...but no personal floatation devices. Consider bringing some form of inflatable, or life jacket that you can fit in your bag. People have drowned, and its a $55,000 life-flight helicopter ride to the nearest hospital. Check out the gift shop and use their 'passport' stamp. We stamped all our dollar bills and other souvenirs. Bring a camera/video/GoPro...you'll be sorry if you don't.

The park itself is interesting--National Park Service rangers are accommodating, interesting, and enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge of this historic park. Snorkeling is the main attraction outside of visiting the fort. Probably the best thing about our own visit was the flight over and back. We had a wonderful pilot, who pointed out ship wrecks, sea turtles, manta rays, and other sites both to and from the key. Because this park is the least accessible National Park in the U.S., with the fewest number of visitors per year, it's kind of a rush to think that you have visited it!

They had breakfast and drinks set up in no time. Our guide was very informative and answered any question we had. Once we got to the island we walked the moat then geared up to snorkel. Lots to see in the beautiful carribean waters. We saw hundreds of corals and so many schools of fish. We came after a big stom so we were swarmed by jelly fish and got stung. Kinda scary but we managed. They had vinegar at the snorkel set up and after a few sprays and eating lunch (which was provided) we were back in the water. The only negative thing I would say is there's not enough time. The 4 hours flew by. I will be back to the keys in September and I'm going back to the Tortugas ,"July 10, 2015",Must Do,7,,5

See, they KNOW they've got you over a barrel because the airplanes are even MORE OUTRAGEOUS and would charge maybe 4-5 times that much. It is a shame to hold you ransom like they do.

That being said, it is worth the price and the early morning departure. Dry Tortugas is beautiful and my only complaint is there isn't enough time to enjoy each part of it. We were surprised by the quality of the snorkeling. There were some colorful coral, sea fans, and anemones-not dead coral that we have seen in other portions of the Caribbean.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Don't bother with the half-day excursions that just dump you over the reef. This is my most favorite thing to do in Key West. Mind you, it's an all-day adventure and you'll be pooped afterwards!There is always plenty of sitting room, and good views when standing, on the Yankee Freedom ferry. They also serve you breakfast, and offer cold-cut sandwiches for lunch while you explore at the park. The seaplane however, is THE way to go. You get to the park hours before the ferry, before everyone, and you get an amazing view of the water. You're bound to see countless sharks and turtles.If it's your first time at the fort, do be sure to take the tour; there may be a lot of people, but it is fascinating to hear the history and follies of the fort. Be sure that you make your way to the top of the fort and behold the amazing view!! Dr. Mudd's cell can be hard to find, so that's another fun thing to see while you're on the tour. Inside of the fort is a great place to catch some shade.The Yankee Freedom & seaplane both offer you snorkel gear; take them up on the offer! The beach entry lets you gradually enter the water to your comfort level, and during the summer, I've found the visibility to be perfect and the water like glass. Even if you're unsure about snorkeling (like me), you'll find yourself paddling out to the coral heads, and even adventuring into the coal docks. You see SO many beautiful reef fishes!

Dry Tortugas National Park,Thank god for this place as we were not happy with the Key West Beaches being we are from NC coast and are used to nice beaches. The snorkeling here was the best I have been to ever! Even better than Mexico. We never stepped foot in the fort because we wanted to spend every minute on the sand and clear beutiful water. Only bummer was that it takes 2.5 hours by the fair and they only give you 4 hours of touring time. The fairy ride over was very organized and accomodating. Fed a very decent and plentiful breakfast and lunch and then the ride back plenty of booze (not included in price).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"As the only member of the family who had been before, I tried to manage expectations, since my last visit was to camp there as a child in the 80s. We are all South Florida natives, so beaches and heat are part of life.... But, WOW!! The fort has been beautifully restored. The snorkeling was amazing. In less than an hour, we saw many types of coral, fish, nurse sharks (mating season) and I saw a massive manta ray. The Fort tour, led by Jeffrey who also crewed our ferry, was outstanding. My father-in-law, a history buff with a docotoare, couldn't get enough. Our seven-year-old, not particularly outdoorsy or interested in history, was enraptured all day long. Hints... If doing only a day trip and snorkeling, buy gear, bring a cooler of food and drinks, snorkel early (tour the fort after), and go the the south beach. You can get a peaceful, private spot all the way down the beach under a shade tree for stowing towels, etc. Snorkel along the wall and into the old pilings. Viewing of coral and wildlife was best off the south shore. Wonderful experience. Camping overnight next time. ","June 30, 2015",Absolutely best part of our four days in KW ,6,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It’s a national park that is a 2.5 hour ferry ride and is located 70 miles west of Key West. The only way to visit is via ferry or seaplane. Cost of the ferry is pricey but not as much as the seaplane. The cost includes transportation, breakfast, lunch, admission to Fort Jefferson and snorkeling gear. Once on the small island, you are treated to fantastic views and great snorkeling. This area was the main shipping channel between the Gulf of Mexico, the western Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. For the history buff, enjoy exploring Fort Jefferson, the largest masonry fort in the United States. Take the guided tour offered by the ferry company or the National Park Service to learn about the fort. It is well worth your time. The name “dry tortugas” was used to alert sailors that there were no natural springs or wells of fresh water on the island. Interesting tidbit: During the Civil War, Fort Jefferson was a Union fortress even though Florida was a Confederate state. Take the tour to learn how this played out. There is no free parking at the Key West ferry terminal. We paid $13 to park about a block away at the city garage and were disappointed when we saw a commercial parking garage located across the street from the ferry terminal offering all day parking for $10.00 a day.

The tour was excellent and Jeff narrated interesting stories re the fort and history.Afterwards, we had plenty of time to snorkel.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The trip was great and was just as advertised so I have nothing but great things to say about the trip itself. However, in my opinion it was not worth the cost. I would rather have gone on 5 separate trips to the reef than this one trip. One issue is that it's two and a half hours each way, which is pretty long to sit on the boat. The fort has a tremendous amount of history so if that appeals to you then my review might not be accurate for you but there isn't much to see but room after room that look exactly the same. We snorkeled around the wall of the fort and enjoyed all of the coral growing but the reef offers good coral viewing as well. Mask, snorkel and swim fins are provided but there are no lifeguards so have some experience before going.Lastly, be aware that after lunch is over everything is put away and something like a can of soda that was free 15 minutes ago now cost a dollar. A small point but had I known I would have grabbed two cans rather than one.","June 22, 2015",Is It Worth the Money?,6,"Williamsburg, VA",3

There is primitive camping on the tiny island but we passed up that because it was really too much for us and too much gear to have to carry. These island are disappearing into the sea more each year so don't plan on waiting too long or , they will be gone. We have recommended this trip to our guests from England and they also Loved it ! The history is fascinating of the Fort there. I could just picture how it must have been back during the Civil War times. I can't recommend this trip highly enough .

Dry Tortugas National Park,"A day trip to the Dry Tortugas was a highlight of our visit to Key West and offered an escape from the crowded tourist spots. If you plan to go via Yankee Freedom III Ferry, book early as this trip sells out quickly. They allow a limited number of passengers daily. Bring your National Park Pass (if you have one) and you'll receive a $5.00 refund prior to boarding.The day trip aboard the ferry affords you 4 hours on Garden Key. Make them count as they fly by quickly! You'll want to soak in the beautiful scenery, history of Fort Jefferson, and bird & marine life. If you plan to tour the fort and go snorkeling or swimming, I would recommend doing a self-guided tour of the fort to save time. Climb the stairs (located in each corner) to the top level to get a wonderful panoramic view of Fort Jefferson, Garden Key & Loggerhead Lighthouses, and pristine turquoise waters below. Check out both of Dr. Mudd's prison cells, his original cell (2nd floor above gift shop) and the one he was in following his failed escape (1st floor). A hearty lunch is served aboard the ferry so take a break from the hot weather to cool down and re-energize. My husband and I went snorkeling along the outer moat wall between the south and north end of the the fort. This area provides an abundance of exotic tropical fish for viewing. We observed several species including Rainbow Parrotfish and Queen Angelfish. In addition, we observed Magnificant Frigate birds soaring high above the fort. Overall, an amazing experience and one we won't forget! Tips: 1. Wear your bathing suit under your clothes to save time. Dressing rooms are crowded. Bring a change of dry clothes for the return trip.2. There are plenty of photo ops on the island. We brought a good camera and inexpensive underwater cameras. We left the good camera in our backpack while snorkeling.3. Be prepared for a sudden change in weather. Summer months in Florida bring afternoon rain showers so enjoy the activity you want to do most early so you won't miss out.4. Bring your National Passport book on your trip and date stamp it on your way out. National Passport books are available at the gift store and are a great way to document your visits to US national parks.

May also consider overnight camping. The waters are amazingly clear which makes for great snorkeling. The views are amazing and have some great pictures worthy of being on the walls. The fort can use some TLC.....if they have staff there 24 hours then why are they not picking up trash inside and outside the fort. It is an amazing structure and when you step at the highest point of the fort be prepared for some amazing views and some of the best pictures ever. We hope to go back later in the year and take the sea planes that way we have more time to explore, snorkel and relax while being so far away from civilization.","June 10, 2015",Beautiful day..well worth the trip,2,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,Just outstanding. It's a long day and a bit expensive at $170 plus tax but for a history buff and lovers of boats and a day long adventure it's worth every penny. We had the good fortune of randomly sitting next to Neil who works in the bookstore on the island. We asked a hundred questions and the poor guy didn't stop talking for the 2 1/4 hour trip out there. We set foot on the island with a list of things to see and a great snorkel route to enjoy. Jeff the boat emcee and fellow history buff gives an hour or so tour and it is not to be missed.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took advantage of booking on the Yankee Freedom for the all day trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park. The tour of the old fort (Fort Jefferson) was good to take in some history and imagine how tough life must have been for both the guards and the inmates. The snorkeling was very good with crystal clear waters...I would recommend the North Beach area as there were more fish and easier water currents. Then, simply chill out on the beach area before returning to the boat for the trip back to Key West. There is a breakfast and lunch served on board and you can always escape the heat by going back on-board to the main cabin. The Captain (Meg) and the entire crew makes the entire adventure something to remember long after you return home.

The flight is amazing and they provide you with information about the area as you take the 40 minute flight. Fort Jefferson is a National Park with Park Ranger tours about the history of the fort as well as the local ecology. The beaches and water around the island are beautiful and snorkeling is fun even if you have never tried to snorkel. The flight allows you to be on the island for either the short approximately 3 hour visit or the 6 1/2 hour day which my wife and I did. Take snacks and lunch.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Theres no better way to spend a day then taking a long boat journey to the absolute end of America to be able to walk among the ruins of an amazing architectural feat. Once done with the very interesting history one can use the fort with its dozens of vantage points to view the tens of thousands of breeding rare birds that inhabit the surrounding keys. If you are more aquatically inclined then you can travel to one of two pristine bone white sand beaches and in the crystal clear water you can view an aquarium worth of fish flitting between the ruins of bricks and cannons. Never in my life have I see something as cool as swimming past a neon green mass of brain coral and coming very close to a respectable sized barracuda lazily swimming among collapsed cannons.,"June 7, 2015",An amazing adventure,5,"Brooklyn, New York",5

It is hot in summer and no concessions so you must be prepared for your visit. There is camping and it is primitive. So you must be fully prepared with food, shelter and potable water. Restrooms are available. It is a special place for peace and quiet. It is a strange and unusual sense of calm and quiet you get when there is complete silence outdoors and all you hear is the wind around the fort. You realize how noisy our daily life really is. I have only had this sensation high up in the rockies when I used to backpack in my younger days.

We waited till the end of our time to tour the fort and the bookstore was closed. Could still see their museum displays. The snorkeling was pretty good and easy to access. The snorkeling equipment was less than desirable. No flotation devices except for a buoyancy vest were available. I would have had more fun with a simple noodle!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I had a lot of questions when first planning my camping trip to Dry Tortugas, so for all the Future Me's out there, I'm hoping the story of my trip will help answer any of your's:Dry Tortugas is one of those national parks that you have limited access to. Either you take the Yankee Freedom out or you're fabulously wealthy and can hire someone to fly you out or get a private boat of your own. My friends and I went with the express interest of camping, but most people who go are just going for the day. However, the Yankee Freedom is, I believe, $180 for a day trip, or you can pay an additional $10 or so and camp for up to three nights. So in terms of getting more bang for your buck, I highly recommend camping (unless you're not into primitive camping on a beautiful desert island ;) ). My friends and I got to the dock super early (the roosters milling about confirmed how early it was) with our gear. There had been a bad storm a day or two before and the crew warned us about the bad chop. Unfortunately in February, though it's typically a dry month, you do run the rare risk of occasionally getting bad weather which leads to rough surf and poor snorkeling conditions. The crew advised everyone to take their dramamine and hold onto some barf bags and for good reason...The ride out started easy enough. They provide a breakfast bar of bagels, fruit, yogurt, etc. After an hour and a half we entered the channel to the island and really rough surf. And that's when I realized why the crew walked around loaded with barf bags. WOW. Mercifully my friends and I held it together and were one of the very few patrons not tossing our recently-consumed-breakfast. I have to applaud the crew who were, without a doubt, absolutely amazing and took care of everyone quickly and efficiently I want to stress our ride out IS NOT THE NORM. We had the severe misfortune of going out to the island the day after a storm and had to deal with chop. I don't want to scare anyone--THIS IS NOT THE NORM. Our trip back two days later was beautifully calm--we ate ice cream and dozed on the deck. But moral of the story? Load up on dramamine. If conditions are supposed to be bad (and they have them posted at the dock) pop two an hour before the boat leaves and you should be fine. And if you can, stay outside at the back of the boat and the air and level horizon should help you out. Once we reached the island we got the rundown on camping rules. They have a rat and hermit crab problem so all food needs to be stored in hard coolers. If you don't have one (we didn't) they provide them to you for free. Also, all trash needs to be hung. Of all the campsites--I believe there are about 8?--two of them have awesome low-hanging tree coverage. The rest have minimal or no tree coverage. If you can get tree coverage of any kind you'll find it convenient in providing shade during the heat of the day and, if like you us you're there following a storm, protection from the wind. Despite it being a clear day we had some STEADY wind blowing all day and night. Not having any tree cover we lay in our tents the first night listening to the wind whipping relentlessly at the fabric all night. The second night was perfectly still and peaceful.The Yankee Freedom remains docked until 3p. During that time, if you need a bathroom, you use the ship's facilities and if you want to snorkel, you can use their gear. I also bought ice for our coolers from the boat. You also get a lunch buffet (sandwiches, pasta salad, fruit, cookies) for one day of your stay (so if you're camping, save your lunch to your last day there). Throughout the day there are tours of the beautiful fort and the gift shop and museum are open. The boat left at 3p and they opened the latrines for the campers (all 18 of us) and we grilled our hamburgers on the charcoal grill. Side note: buy some sterno to lather onto your charcoals. And there is no fresh water on the island so you really want to be overly cautious about water. Granted, my friends and I brought way WAY more water than we needed, but that's better than the other way around IMO.Watching the sunset and the stars come out while sitting on the wall around the fort was absolutely second to none. This is one of the reasons I really stress camping. It's such a beautiful place, and only getting to see it for the day is not doing it enough justice.If I was to go again, a park ranger at the Everglades said the best snorkeling is a short kayak trip from Dry Tortugas over to Loggerhead Key, although in that situation you'd have to bring your own kayak on the ferry which requires setting that up with the Yankee Freedom ahead of time.","May 29, 2015",Camping on a Desert Island,9,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

When we arrived, others were returning and arriving by sea plane. We spoke with a couple who had camped there for 10 days and loved it. You need to provision for yourself, and carry in, carry out what you take. The boat staff was wonderful on the ride over, friendly and answer questions. You can tell they're getting ready to help sea sick people move to the back of the boat, when the boat starts rocking in the Rebecca Straits.The staff put on their gloves, put away bar drink, and grab their paper towels. If you are at all prone to sea sickness, be sure to take your meds before you go, and consider flying by sea plane instead. We walked around the Fort, took pictures, and then got in the water to snorkel. The snorkeling was good along the wall of the fort, and is our choice of exercise. Glad we brought wetsuits as it was about 72 degrees F. We then went into the visitor center where they had a gift shop and interesting video about the history there. At 12:30 PM we went back to the boat and had a lunch of yummy make your own sandwiches, then toured the fort on our own. We arrived back and tipped the awesome staff upon departing the boat.

Camping on the island is a truly unique experience. Visitors who don't camp on the island leave by mid afternoon. With so few camping sites it gives you the feeling that you have the whole island to yourself.

We failed to make the camping booking so we had to settle for the day tour which would start at around 10:30 a.m. wen the boat arrives at Garden Key and end at 3:00p.m. when the boat leaves. This was a trip that combined nature and man-made wonders. The beaches were immaculate with the fine, white sand and the turquoise waters. The unfinished fort of 15 million bricks was amazing.

I recommend taking one of the guided tours if you want to learn about the history of the Fort. The only downside was, I felt like I could have spent much more time there... I may go on one of the camping trips next time. Fantastic snorkeling! If you want too see more fish check out the coal docks.

At 10:30 am the ferry showed up and wow we we're glad we chose the plane. Tons of people poured off the ferry, kids screaming and running around, and if you like that tourist feel of being surrounded by 100 other people taking pictures, then go for it.

It is a fairly smooth ride and they play videos that are educationally directed towards enjoying the trip. the staff is eager to answer any questions and provide any service they can to make your trip enjoyable. The snorkeling is amazing in several different areas around the fort. Before history is very interesting and educational. It is truly an amazing place that few people have an opportunity to visit. The beauty that surrounds the fort is very unique. I'm always amazed at the incredible colors and contrast between the greenery, the tan beaches and the beautiful different colors of water.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you like National Parks and are into history, then this is a must-see for you while you're in Key West. Take the Key West Seaplane Adventures plane out there instead of the ferry- it's an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience where you'll see shipwrecks, turtles, and amazingly beautiful aerial views from about 200 feet above the water during your 35-minute flight. It's also only a half-day commitment instead of dedicating a full day if you take the ferry.The fort itself was built between 1846 and 1873. It is the largest brick structure in the western hemisphere at 14 million bricks. It's a massive structure. Some parts are long gone (such as the officers' housing and enlisted barracks), but their foundations remain. The fort was never finished as it was rendered obsolete after the Civil War, so it was used as a prison for a few years before being abandoned in 1873. A walking tour of the fort could take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and covers all 3 stories of the fort.There is also great snorkeling nearby- coral and different types of fish.This was easily the highlight of the Key West leg of our honeymoon and I'd highly recommend it.","May 16, 2015",Amazing feat of engineering and beautiful environs!,56,"West Chicago, Illinois",5

The fort itself is a sight to see. More cannon ports than you can count and you can walk around the entire grounds as well as along the top of the fort which gives you a panoramic view of the surrounding waters. You can also camp here and it is one of two National Parks that legally allow alcohol on its grounds. The snorkeling here was also outstanding but stick close to the sea wall and the old dock pilings to see the best stuff which included barracuda, tarpon, parrot fish, zebra fish, and many different aquatic plants and coral.

Don't miss Lincoln assassination conspirator Samuel Mudd's cell ... and pay particular attention to the story of his release. Extremely interesting!The only con is that I got seasick on the ferry ride back, even after taking motion sickness medicine. I had to spend the long ferry ride on the outside deck staring it the horizon. That's not a mark against the trip itself, just a warning to travelers not to start with your back to the front of the boat on the upper deck!Hope you enjoy the Dry Tortugas as much as I did!

The history of Fort Jefferson is interesting and the beaches are very nice as well. Jeff shared interesting stories and kept our attention on the way there and also during the tour of the fort. The south beach was nice and the water was awesome. The visibility was very good and I was able to see lots of beautiful fish and coral next to the pilings and the outside of the moat wall. The current was strong at times and would make it tiresome but I took breaks and then went back out several times. The park allows overnight campers although they have to bring their own water as there is not water available. There are lots of birds to see and even a large amount of terns on and adjoining key. I was able to take the trail at the top of the fort and see a nice panoramic view and the lighthouse on Loggerhead Key. This was a great trip and so worth it.

Breakfast was bagels, ham, cream cheese, juice, grapes, yogurt, cereal, hard boiled egg, coffee, tea. Buffet style. Pretty basic but satisfied. Water and coffee available all day. 2 ½ hours out to the Dry Tortugas. Lots of fun watching the flying fish. Best snorkeling was at the “docks” in that there was the most biodiversity. So recommend that. Snorkeling out at the “reef” was maybe not worth it. There is really no reef there. Just a couple of coral heads. Check out Bush Key – can’t go on it, but worth getting as close as you can just to see all the birds. Sounds and sights were great.Lunch on the ferry: different kinds of bread sliced, chicken salad, ham, turkey, cheese + condiments. Sodas. Again – basic, but did the job. Fresh water showers on the boat after snorkeling.So I can’t strongly recommend going for great snorkeling, but it was still a fun day trip and the fort was impressive to see.","May 13, 2015",Good trip but snorkeling not the best,55,"Arlington, Virginia",4

We were going mostly for the snorkeling, which we did around the pilings and coral heads farther out. Visibility was just average the day we went, but nevertheless it was really interesting stuff to see how the sea is reclaiming the pilings and old ladders and whatever is on the bottom, building up coral and attracting fish of all kinds. Breakfast and lunch are served on the boat, and the food was plentiful and good. Nothing gourmet, but well done and no one went hungry, even vegetarians could be happy with the buffet.

The snorkeling is wonderful. The best way to see the island/fort is to take the seaplane in the afternoon. The catamaran with it's load of 80-100 people is just leaving. This leaves just the occupants of the seaplane (10 people) and the 7 park rangers that live there permanently to occupy the whole place. It is quiet. It is peaceful.

The weather was not too cooperative as there had been a storm the day before and the water was choppy with 4-6 ft. swells. If you are going on this trip with conditions like this and have NEVER been seasick buy the dramamine when they are selling it. We didn't and later wished that we had. Anyway, the fort was very interesting. We enjoyed the Moat Walk with the Ranger, Michael. Due to the waves going over the wall, the trip was shorter than usual. However, we learned a lot about the history of the fort and the wildlife in the moat. Also, we were able to see frigate birds, ruddy turnstones that were nesting, green heron, snowy egrets, swifts, and many gulls. We were hoping to snorkel, but it was a bit rough for inexperienced snorkelers. However, we enjoyed sitting on the beach area and wading. We actually saw a starfish on the beach.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This trip satisfies many hungers - if you like a nice boat trip, it has that (although I wouldn't recommend this attraction just for the boat trip, since you will spending time off the boat and be on an island for a few hours), if you are a history buff, the fort and its history is very interesting, or if you just want a day away from Key West, this trip has a nice beach and the availability for snorkeling. I'm a history buff and like crawling around forts. After the guided tour (which you don't have to attend, but I recommend it) you are free to wander around the fort. Since the amount of people on the island is limited to the number of people the boat holds, you will definitely be able to see all the integrate details of the fort without running into a lot of people. However, I highly recommend this trip even if the fort is not the main reason for your visit. One word of caution - you are away for highly protected waters, and it can get a bit rough at times.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We've been four times in twelve years and we'll probably go back someday. Fort Jefferson is truly amazing and we learn something new every time. The Yankee Freedom is a nice boat and the crew is tremendous, especially considering what they often have to deal with. The 2-1/2 hour ride can be difficult and if you are prone to seasickness beware. On our most recent trip about a third of the passengers were given barf bags and most made use of them. No matter how sunny and beautiful it seems at the terminal this ride can be tough. Don't take this trip after stumbling out of Sloppy Joe's at 2:00 AM and don't get on that boat without taking Dramamine about an hour before you leave (and probably another just before stepping on). If you start out sitting in an enclosed area, eat your breakfast noting that you might be seeing it again. If you start to feel the slightest bit queasy when sitting inside get outside on deck immediately and hold on to the rail looking forward with some wind in your face. That might do the trick if you're not too late. The ride out is not particularly scenic. The destination is magical. The snorkeling is good and if the ride back is calm, the frozen drinks on the Yankee Freedom are great. For four people of various ages this trip cost us about $600.00 so it's not cheap but in terms of value we are never disappointed. Even the person in our party who lost it on the way out said she'd go again in a heartbeat.","May 8, 2015",For the right people (and perhaps not you) this place is amazing!,38,New Hampshire,5

The price includes passage to the park as weel as breakfast and lunch. They also serve mixed drinks and beer on the return trip. We got to the boat and checked in at 7:30am and had breakfast just as they were departing the dock. Breakfast consisted of: Cereal, Bagels and cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, milk, orange juice, coffee, fresh fruit, yogurt. The ride out to the Island was about 2.5 hours or so depending on the weather. the day we went 6/18/13 the water was real choppy and very windy so the ride was a lil rough. Once out on the Island you were free to do what ever you wanted weither it was Snorkling, self-guided tour or ranger guided tour. I chose to do the self guided tour and manage to take alot of beautiful pictures and learned alot along the way. Lunch was served on the boat between 11:00a-1:00p and consisted of: HAM or Turkey sandwiches, fresh fruit, chips, cookies and a soda. The sandwiches you make yourself. Mine was Turkey w/ swiss, tomato, lettuce, mayo, banana peppers and a lil mustard. The sandwich was AWESOME! After lunch i decided to do some snorkling. there wasing much to see except a few fish and the visability wasnt the greates due to the recent cold front that moved through the area. The water temp was aroung 76* so not too cold yet not warm either. we were back on the boat at 2:30p and departed there shortly after. mixed drinks and beer were served the whole way back to the dock. It was alot rougher on the ride back as waves were around 8ft. The only thing that stinks about it is your stuck on a boat for 5 hours during the day. other than that I wish i could rate it higher than 5 stars as the crew did an outstanding job and were always there to answer questions. I was told the boat is brand new as of October 2012. Its a very spacious boat with TONS of room to put your belongings there was 4 nice bathrooms on-board and 3 fresh water showers on the aft of the boat.

The only negative was the poor condition of the changing rooms.There is no other National Park like this so make sure that you get there! ,"May 2, 2015",Highlight of our trip,95,NJ,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was looking forward to visiting Dry Tortugas NP, especially since we are trying to visit all of the U.S. NPs. I guess I expected more. They tout it as having beaches, snorkeling, history. It's a 2.5 hr. boat ride, very expensive to get to, the beaches can get crowded and the snorkeling is not very good (not a lot of fish or coral, just grasses). The history is very interesting and they provide guided tours (we took a self-guided tour) and so is exploring the fort and walking the seawall. Access to Bush Key was closed (a little disappointed that we couldn't explore). My husband, on the other liked everything about it (except the snorkeling) and thought overall it was a great day (hence the mixed reviews). I am glad we did this just to say we did but am not really sure it's worth $170/pp (more if you charter a private plane).","May 2, 2015",Mixed reviews (would really rate it 3.5),164,"Abington, Pennsylvania",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is an amazing place to spend a day if you love being out on the water and spending the day on a remote island. We took the Yankee Freedom ferry. The trip takes nearly 2 1/2 hours each way, but the views are stunning! We saw dolphins, sea turtles, a barracuda, and many birds on the way out there. I hear the snorkeling on the island is amazing, but we were too chicken to swim out far because the crocodile was hanging around. We had a great time just walking around the island and inside the fort and taking pictures. The ""sand"" on the beaches is cool. It's not sand, but actually crushed up coral and shells! The lady in the gift shop is a hoot, be sure to stop by and say hi to her! I can't wait to visit again! Next time we will bring our daughter and hopefully camp.","May 2, 2015",Can't wait to go back!,3,"Hugo, Minnesota",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This national park is very remote but has rich wildlife and history. Although you need the entire day and spend $170 for a round trip boat ride to visit this national park, it is worthy a visit.The boat ride is smooth, professionally run including buffet breakfast and lunch. It also cover the snorkeling equipment so you can enjoy fantastic snorkeling while on the island.Overall, a fantastic national park to visit - highly recommended.","May 1, 2015",A Must Visit,86,"Fallbrook, California",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee III ferry boat. The trip is long but it seemed to go by fast. They gave us breakfast on the way out (continental breakfast) and then lunch shortly after we landed. It was make your own sandwiches. Both were good. The people working for the boat were great, very friendly and helpful. Be prepared for it to be really really hot with not a ton of shade. You have to use the bathrooms on the boat as there are no open ones on the island while the boat is docked. The people already on the island will also use these bathrooms so be prepared to wait. The fort has an interesting history, but there really isn't much to see after about 1/2 hour. The rest of the time we spent on the beach. It is beautiful but the sand is extremely sharp, so wear appropriate foot wear and you will be happy. They give great guidance on the snorkeling equipment, but you are on your own in the water. so don't go alone. Also, please don't throw trash, including cigarette butts out on the island. Bring back everything to the trash and recycle cans provided by the boat. The wildlife will get into it and be hurt otherwise. You will see lots of unique birds as well as fish. I am very glad I went. But I don't think I would go back now that I've seen it. Don't bring a heavy pack to carry around as there is no place to leave it. No internet connections or phone connections.","April 30, 2015",Great trip but not sure I would do it twice.,51,Washington State,4

Dry Tortugas National Park,If you want to relax and get away from Duval St for the day (you can hit it when you get back) then going to Fort Jefferson is the place to go.

A pretty decent lunch was also served.,"April 29, 2015",Ferry boat ride to Ft. Jefferson,15,"Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the Yankee Freedom out there. They say the trip is 2 hours 15 minutes, however, it is closer to two hours 45 minutes. The boat leaves at 8:00am promptly and arrives around 10:40 or so. We left at 2:45pm and arrived back at 5:30pm; that is the daily scheduled dock landing arrival. Weather was perfect. Fort Jefferson is an amazing edifice that has withstood the test of time pretty well. A ranger gave us a nice 1 hour informative tour. Lunch was buffet on the boat from 11am - 1pm mainly consisting of sandwiches and chicken salad (was pretty good actually). There was plenty of time afterward to snorkel or swim. The waters around the fort are beautiful. We were there at tern nesting time so we couldn't walk out to Bush Island. It's a great birdwatching place and there were several ""birders"" on the boat with us who were continually calling out unique bird sightings. Saw a few sea turtles from the boat as well. While walking the ledge around the fort we saw a school of barracuda. It is definitely an interesting trip that I would recommend. If you're pressed for time, I would consider the Sea Plane over the ferry since you're out on the water 5 1/2 hours and it makes for a long day. Ferry is $170 per person. $160 with senior, student or military discount. You need reservations in advance especially high season and weekends.","April 29, 2015",Beautiful destination- long trip there and back by boat,31,"Manchester, New Hampshire",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The National Park itself was excellent. We had a very enjoyable day exploring Fort Jefferson and snorkeling off the beach. The company that runs the ferry (Yankee Freedom III) left a lot to be desired. The ferry tickets are pricey ($170/person), and the trip takes 2 1/4 hrs each way - a good thing to be aware of if you tend to get seasick. Dramamine is available for purchase on board but bring your own if you think you will need it because it's not cheap. I am not prone to seasickness, and our ride was pretty smooth, but I did get a bit queasy on the way there. When I purchased our tickets over the phone, I was referred to the FAQs on the website and told that any questions I had would be answered on the site. Not true. The website doesn't state that a light breakfast and a ""make your own sandwich"" lunch are included in the price of the ticket. As a result, we ended up bringing food and water for the trip (as there are absolutely no concessions on the island). The experience would have been better if we had a more solid understanding of what to expect. Based on other reviews, it seems like many others had the same experience. The highlight of the trip for me was the snorkeling. The ferry company provides snorkel gear, fins and flotation vests if needed. The folks in charge of giving out the gear were helpful in directing us to the best spots to snorkel. Regarding the island, as I mentioned there are NO concessions on the island. That includes public restrooms. Fortunately, the ferry lavatories are available to passengers throughout the trip. There is also very little shade so bring sunscreen.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Let me start by saying, i have never experienced a place like this before in my life!!My boyfriend and i camped 2 nights and we were just overwhelmed with excitement. We meet wonderful people, loud hermit crabs, and the crocodile. The trip wouldn't have been the same if we didn't camp, it's worth the time if you have it. Its a place that needs more then 6 hours to explore.One of the greatest things is when all the day trip people leave and there's only a few campers to venture out. This was my first time snorkeling and the guy that was working at the gift shop gave us a great spot to go and i couldn't believe the fish and coral, It was outstanding!!I don't want to give away to much information about Dry Tortuags, it's just a must see place.","April 27, 2015",Gorgeous place to camp and explore,2,"Worcester, Massachusetts",5

We were lucky enough to reserve a camping spot, and after one night we begged the captain of the ferry to stay another day...he let us :)Everything about our stay was amazing. The scenery is almost out of a movie, the snorkeling was awesome, the crocodile in the moat was a cool thing to try to find, and the Fort is so fun to run around in. If you're lucky enough to get a camping spot, when everyone else leaves at 2:30 it'd just you and 10 other people. It's so peaceful you feel like you're on a deserted island. Hundreds of hermit crabs come out when the sun starts to go down. It was so cool! The sunset & the stargazing on the moat was pretty amazing as well.DO THIS! It's such a hidden gem in FL, & an amazing National Park.

The Yankee Freedom ferry ride was smooth and very hospitable and sightings of sea turtles were plenty. The snorkeling was incredible on the south side of the park and you can even camp out over night if you are up to really roughing it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was a great day trip from Key West and well worth the money considering it includes breakfast, lunch, and admission to the park. The ride out on the ferry was rougher than I expected on a boat of this size, so if you get even slightly motion sick then take the Dramamine they offer. Also, this isn't the best trip to take after a night on Duvall Street (my husband learned this the hard way), but otherwise the trip was well organized and fun. Breakfast is served on the way out and they start serving lunch not long after docking. You pretty much have free range of the island until it's time to leave. There is an optional guided tour of the fort which is included and I highly recommend you take it. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable as well as funny and really brought life at the fort to life. After the tour and lunch we laid on one of the beaches and snorkeled until it was time to go. Snorkeling equipment is provided. We didn't see much in the way of fish on our trip, but this seems to have been a fluke as many people have told us the snorkeling is normally really good. The trip really does take all day so I wouldn't recommend it for a long weekend, but if you are staying 5 days or more this is a great trip!","April 22, 2015",Wonderful day trip but bumpy ride,135,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,We weren't sure about taking the trip because of the cost but it was well worth it. Getting a unique slice of history and snorkeling in the clear Aqua waters wa great. The only disappointment was the limited birding. It may have been too late in the year to see the array of species I was expecting. As it is the time is limited and we could have spent many more hours at the park. The boat was clean and the food was fine. I don't know what people were expecting but there was enough wholesome food to satisfy ones hunger. A seaplane is probably ideal because it gives you more time on the island.PS bring your National Park Pass and save a few dollars.,"April 21, 2015",Great Day Trip,43,ny,4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We opted to come by seaplane for the half day excursion (sea plane) as we really didn’t know what to expect. Bring your camera for sure.The Keys Seaplane Adventures has a barcode you can scan and download a document to do a self guided tour. Note that there is no cell service on the island, but if you download it before you leave, you’ll have it when you arrive. We didn’t actually read it until we got back to the hotel. Well worth reading, at least later.The fort is pretty cool. It gets very hot in the courtyard, but if you go to the corner where the lighthouse is (to the right of the entrance when you walk in) you’ll find stairs that will take you all the way to the top. It feels air conditioned from the sea breeze. Be careful though, I wouldn’t bring small children up there as there are no guard rails. The fort itself was worth seeing but we only toured that corner area as we were only going to be on the island for 2 and ½ hours so we didn’t venture too far in. Had it been a full day, we would have spent more time there.We walked the entire perimeter of the fort via the wall of the mote and saw plenty of sea life within the walls of the mote. And yes, there is a resident Crocodile there that the campers were telling us about. However, we didn’t see him. We’re told he goes out to sea to feed…The big beach that you see in the pictures (the no swim area) was closed due to bird migration. A couple of girls started out there and decided the dive bombing birds were not worth venturing any further. However, you can get a fantastic view from the top of the fort.We did snorkel a little on the south beach but didn’t venture too far as our time was limited. The water was warm, and clear as clear can be. We were told that there was better snorkeling along the wall of the fort going towards the west side.Could we spend an entire day there? Probably. I know nothing of the Ferry that brings you out there, but that would certainly be an option, much less expensive than taking the sea plane for a full day excursion.It was defiantly a highlight for my husband and I. We even discussed camping a night or two some time when we return.

The tour begins in the port of Key West with the Yankee Freedom ferry and takes 2 1/2 hours to get there. You have an option of a guided tour which I recommend, great information if you like history. They provide breakfast and lunch but be mindful of the time as they get a very tight ship with food schedule. I really enjoyed the great guides and the Yankee freedom ferry. Again the history is just like none other. Dr. Mudd and others that endured the heat and condition here ... well I can't even began to understand. It was hot when I went (April 2015), but we had a breeze which they say stops during the summer months. I would recommend the winter months to visit.

The snorkeling was enjoyable in warm and very clear water. We saw lots of marine life. The trip also included lunch which again included lots of variety making everyone happy. The staff was fun, very friendly and knowledgeable about the history of the fort. Before we knew it, it was time to board the boat for the return trip. They sold snacks and beverages, including alcoholic drinks on the boat ride back to Key West and I was quite surprised (and pleasantly so) that the prices were extremely reasonable. If there was any downside to this excursion, it was that the day went by too quickly and we could have easily used more time to explore the fort and enjoy the beautiful setting.

The boat provided free gear. My 10 year old took to it like the proverbial fish to water. We snorkeled along the walls and took trips to the coal dock ruins. We saw countless fish and a good amount of coral. Even got to see a 100-150 pound tuna swim by.Fort Jefferson was amazing, especially in the morning hours before the ferry showed up. The boys and I played hide and seek. One night, the park ranger came to the camping area just after dark and told us he was showing a movie. We watched on a projection screen The Prisoner of Shark Island. It was a fictionalized telling of the story of Samuel Mudd (one of the people convicted as a co-conspirator in the killing of President Lincoln). Watching the old black and white movie in a 175 year old fort, under the stars, was a great time.In the moat we got to see the crocodile. He would only come out when the ferry left.

No coffee until about 8:30, so have some before you board at 7:45!The boat ride is about 2 1/2 hours out to the fort. The boat is large and roomy on the trip out, so enjoy the ride. Once you get to the fort, you can walk the grounds until lunchtime. Lunch is served on the boat. If you snorkel, you can take your own gear or rent some. The snorkeling is touted as some of the best anywhere. Take a tent and camp; you can catch the boat back the net day. you will need to set up the overnight when you book your trip. The fort was used only as a prison, never having been attacked. Dr. Mudd, who treated John Wilkes Booth (killer of Pres. Lincoln), was imprisoned at the fort after the civil war. He received a life sentence but was released due to his help treating serious disease outbreaks at the fort.","April 14, 2015",Long Boat Ride,80,"Hernando, Florida",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"3 adults took this day trip to the Dry Tortugas. The boat staff does a good job. The venue provides snorkeling gear for those interested. There is a narrated tour, or you can do your own thing. The tour price includes the Natl. Park Admission fee.On the 2.5 hour trip out, the boat provides breakfast (hard boiled eggs, bagels, cream cheese, fruit, juice, and coffee). Once at the Dry Tortugas, lunch was provided on the boat...(turkey, ham, cheese, chicken salad, lettuce, tomato, pasta salad, condiments, and various bread as well as chips, soda, and water (no fee)). On the way back, the bar is available for paid drinks.The quality of the snorkel gear is okay. The rangers on board are knowledgeable and really try to get the younger clients interested in the Jr. Ranger Program. That is a bonus, because this is one of the hardest pins to get for them.If you snorkel, bring a towel. Binoculars are good to have for the various birding available. It is also good to have a day pack.","April 13, 2015",A great day on the water!,39,"Anchorage, Alaska",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I took the commercial boat to the Dry Tortugas. It was very comfortable and easy. We only got 4 1/2 hour on the island and it simply was not enough time to do everything I wanted to do. My mom and I went on a great ecology tour. Michael, our guide, was very engaging and knowledgeable about the ecology of the area as well as the history of Fort Jefferson and it's present state.We went snorkeling. The water was beautiful and the 3 types of coral we saw were lovely but there really wasn't that much to see in the water... the snorkeling was average. Honestly, I was so blown away by everything else the snorkeling barely fazed me. I would like to go back to camp on the island and take the history tour. This place was gorgeous and fascinating. I will be back.","April 12, 2015",I didn't stay long enough.,24,"Orlando, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We went by air (KW Seaplanes) and while expensive, completely worth it. The plane was a huge part of the adventure! 45 minutes vs 2 hours on the ferry, plus we saw sea life and wrecks from the plane - our pilot, Ewan, told us what to look for below and we got to the island (without hot, cramped quarters or seasickness) 2 hours before the crowds got off the ferry. Great place for snorkeling, exploring the fort and enjoying the natural beauty.","April 12, 2015",Worth the trip!,15,"Amston, Connecticut",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"So, we were not going to go...$160-170/person--but, we figured we wanted to snorkle and do the beach (beaches in Key West are not the best.) We were not disappointed. We did have to get to the boat, we were told, by 7--you can really get there at 7:30 and have a half an hour; and after a live Jimmie Buffett concert the night before it was challenging. The people running it are the American Historic Tours people, same people that do the BostonTea Party in Boston, and they're good--know their history and give a good and entertaining lecture at Fort Jefferson. The tour provides a nice buffet breakfast and lunch--now we're not talking any cooked food here, but, they had a very good marble rye for sandwiches. They also provided good snorkle gear---that was clean--no skanky stuff. Beach was fantastic and the snorkling was right off the beach and it was decent. Many families and campers! We heard the camping was fun and the sky was awesome at night. My oldest daughter and son in law want to come back and camp. The ride home was good--we had little over 4 hours on the island. Probably the best thing we did while visiting Key West---because I did NOT go fishing!","April 11, 2015",Nice boat ride to a cool place.,8,"Flamingos, Mexico",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"What a great trip and beautiful place! A must do in Key West! We took the boat. The boat trip is an all day adventure. Great, friendly, entertaining crew that teaches you the history on the trip over. 2 plus hour ride there and back. There is also a seaplane trip also which takes much less time and can be a half day if you don't have the time to spend all day. I would definitely go back.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Was hesitant to take this full day adventure but so glad we did! We have never been disappointed with national park activities and this was was not the exception. Loved learning more about the fort, it's history, and the aquatic species surrounding Garden Island. The ferry ride over to Fort Jefferson was relaxing and informative. The food offered was plentiful and surprising good. Took two guided tours so we didn't have enough time to take advantage of the snorkeling activities (which everyone said were wonderful).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a seaplane with Key West Seaplane Charters. I was pricey and we thought about not doing it to have money for other stuff during the vacation, but are extremely happy we didn't. The 3 or so hours on the island turned out to be the highlight of our week long trip in Orlando and Key West. We arrived at 2pm. As we were flying in the Ferry was already loaded up and beginning to cruise out. Population on the island was ......maybe 20. lol. Two seaplanes worth of people and 3 tents with people camping out. Otherwise we pretty much had the beach to ourselves at that time. The beach was very clean. The sand is white and very granular instead of mushy like some of the Key state parks. The water is clear. The fort itself is also something that is great for building memories. There is a tower with spiraling steps that we climbed. At the top is a 360 degree view of absolute beauty. My boys were in love with the giant canon. All in all it was a great family experience and one we hope to revisit very soon. And again I stress taking the seaplane. It's only a 36 minute flight. The pilot takes you over some wonderful sites. It is worth every penny.","April 8, 2015",As close to paradise as you can get without paying huge airline fees.,8,,5

I felt they should have had an experience diver show you where you could see the best fish.,"April 4, 2015",A bit boring,2,"Franklin, Wisconsin",2
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was a little hesitant to spend the money for this trip (we are a family of five, and this would easily be our most expensive outing of the trip), but I also knew the chances of our having the opportunity to visit the Dry Tortugas again were slim. I also was hesitant about trying to drag three teens/tweens out of bed to make the 7:15 boarding time (and we didn't have a car while in Key West, so I also had to make them walk almost a mile!). However, this day trip turned out to be a highlight of our week. We took the Yankee Clipper ferry -- it is extremely well organized and it is clear the staff know how to make the trip run ""like clockwork"". We sat in the lower level, and while the boat ride part is a bit long (bring a book!), the staff breaks up the trip with a nice continental breakfast, informative announcements, a video, etc. Once we got to the Dry Tortugas, we explored on our own (we somehow didn't catch the announcement telling us that they were putting out sign-ups for the guided tours). However, we were happy touring by ourselves. We toured right away, and the fort is so large that it is easy to feel like you are the only people there. Lunch was cold cuts/sandwiches, fruit, soda, cookies -- just right for the occasion. We snorkeled after lunch and then relaxed on the beach. Later we walked around the island. What a perfect day! We were lucky to have perfect weather, but the views and the island itself are breathtaking. When we returned to the boat at 2:45 we were surprised to find people already at the bar and settling in for the ride back. The ride back was more festive (because of the bar) and the staff plays a movie as well. Overall, a full and fun day. Bring plenty of sunscreen, hats, a sweater/light jacket, towels, etc. Expensive for a family, but the trip of a lifetime.","April 4, 2015",Worth the trip!,132,"Swarthmore, Pennsylvania",5

We self toured the fort instead which was interesting and fun. The snorkeling was excellent too right off the beach. They provide good gear. The 2 hr 15 min trip there and back did not feel long.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The perfect mix of Adventure, History, and Eco-Tourism. I took the Key West Seaplane out here (take the first flight out in the morning). My 4hr trip gave me about 2.5hrs on the island. I quickly made friends on the plane and once we landed, we did a quick tour of the fort (definitely climb to the rooftop and look out). Once we got a feel for the fort we made a quick stop at the Gift shop for National Park Passport stamp (google it..... and you can say you got one of the rarest national park passport stamps out there). Following that, we hit the beach and jumped in for some snorkeling. The water is the clearest I've ever seen, and the pilot gave us suggestions on where to snorkel. My group saw everything from coral to small colorful fish to a live conch shell to a stingray. It was so impressive. They do allow for camping on the island, and I'm already working on a plan to come back with friends to do so. ","April 3, 2015",A memory that will last a lifetime!,18,"Jackson Heights, New York",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited Dry Tortugas on our first full day in Key West via the Yankee Freedom III ferry. This is an all day excursion, but worth the unique and historical experience. The park is about 70 miles southwest of Key West and offers a fun snorkeling, water sport opportunity along with small beaches, historical national park Ft. Jefferson, and amazing views. The ferry offered a light continental breakfast and lunch for passengers. The boat was well maintained and offers clean restrooms as well as outside showers to rinse off the sand and saltwater after an afternoon of swimming and snorkeling. On the 2.5 hour trip back they offer happy hour drinks too! All of the staff aboard the ferry were helpful and friendly.

Sea sickness tablets for 1$ were sold by the well drilled and very efficient crew. It took around two hours on the Yankee Freedom to reach the national park.Even with a full ferry, there was plenty of space on the island to find a secluded spot and chill on the beach.You can of camp for the night for a more secluded experience.Walking around Fort Jefferson was interesting but we did not stay for the whole guided tour.

One recommendation is to bring a book for the two - three hour trip out and again on the way back.

The ferry website explains everything in detail. We walked around the fort but many people took advantage of tours. We went to the top of the fort for the impressive view and also walked the moat. I would suggest at least doing that. We had the buffet lunch back on the ferry and then spent the rest of the time snorkeling the pylons. It was so fun! The way back on the ferry we stood outside on the ferry deck and watched for sea turtles - I think we spotted about 5-6.

However we had arrived at the kiosk at 3pm, which as it turns out is the deadline for canceling the next day's trip for full credit. As luck would have it, someone had just canceled, and we got on the next morning. A front had passed through the area the night before, so the weather was cool and the water was very choppy - 3-5 food waves. The crew pushed Dramamine on the passengers beginning over an hour before we were to set sail. As a result the motion sickness was held to a minimum. They served a minimal breakfast and lunch. Other food was offered after lunch. I took the two offered tours, one concentrating on the Dry Tortugas, as a whole and the second looking at Fort Jefferson. Both were quite interesting. To the east of the fort (and dock) were Bush and Long Keys which were teeming with birds. They were nesting there and we were limited as to how close we could go. I took a couple of hundred pictures, including some real keepers. While the boat also provided snorkel gear, i felt it was too cold to take advantage of the offer.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was a nice day trip from Key West. We took the Yankee Freedom ferry and it's an early start to the day (had to be there at 7:30) to check in but the trip includes both breakfast and lunch. This is an all day excursion and MUST be booked in advance. It gets sold out early so make your reservations early. We enjoyed the Fort Jefferson tour too The ferry has snorkel equipment if you want to snorkel on the island. You can swim on one of the beaches but some of the areas were closed because the birds were nesting. You can take a sea plane to the island but it's a lot more expensive than the ferry. There is no fresh water on the island nor are there bathrooms but you can get fresh water from the ferry and use the bathrooms on the ferry too. There are changing facilities on the island. Be sure to bring water, sunscreen, fresh clothing to change into and a camera as the views are wonderful. If you get seasick try to get in the upstairs inside or outside cabin on the ferry as you don't feel the movement of the boat as much.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Really enjoyed this trip. Have been to Key West many times and this was the first time we took advantage of Dry Tortugas, mainly because of the early start necessary to be at the Ferry Station by 7 AM. We were told by our trip guide that it would be a good idea to take dramamine because the water could be a little rough. They offer the pills if you need them for a small fee. We did take the dramamine but the ride seemed pretty smooth but may be it was the pill that made us think so. The breakfast was what you might expect on a ferry boat but plentiful and friendly service throughout. It took about 2 hours or so to reach the Fort. Once there, you were able to either take the guided tour or self tour. Snorkeling and beach time were other options during the day. It was nice that lunch was served on the ferry for a couple hours which meant that it wasn't crowded at any one time. So you could tour the fort or snorkel and then have lunch at your convenience. The staff on the ferry were fun and friendly so it may the day entertaining. It is possible to camp there overnight which some spring breaker college kids were doing. All in all, a fun and educational break while in Key West. ","March 24, 2015",Finally got there!,34,"Philadelphia, PA",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I highly recommend this trip to anyone that hasn't done it yet. Sure, the boat ride out there is 2 and a half hours but it is worth it! They serve you breakfast, which is a selection of bagels, cheese, fruit, hard boiled eggs, ham, cereal, yogurt, and orange juice. It's not bad at all! Once you get to the island you get off and can tour the fort yourself, have a guided tour, or go snorkeling. You stay there for 4 hours so plan accordingly. We did a self guided tour of the fort first. Make sure you go up the stairs to the top of the fort so you can see the amazing view. Then we walked on the moat walls around the fort and saw some awesome looking fish from above. They will serve you lunch from 11:30 - 1 so we went and got lunch. A lot of the reviews here complain about the lunch food, but what do you expect? They can't cook a gourmet meal for you! It was great for what it was: sandwiches. I'm not sure if I was super hungry or what, but those were some really good sandwiches. They offer a variety of breads, lunch meat, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and condiments for your sandwich. They also offered fruit, chips, and cookies. After lunch we snorkeled. They offer free snorkeling gear. Make sure you try on your fins before you go to the beach. We saw some really cool fish! Do not just stay by the walls of the moat when snorkeling. We went out to the coral reef that is there and saw some interesting fish.The island has changing rooms, but no bathrooms. You have to go back on the boat for the bathroom. The trip back wasn't too bad, especially since they serve alcohol. They have a full bar and are very heavy handed with pouring.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It is an expensive venture for a day and our goal was to get in some great snorkeling. We checked weather day prior and it looked great so we kept our reservation on the Yankee Freedom Ferry (see my review on their page). The day of our departure (March 7, 2015) was overcast but we were hopeful it would clear up; it didn't. It was a cool day and water was murky so snorkeling was terrible. We enjoyed our tour of the fort and spent some time relaxing on the beach and bird watching. I think if I did it again I'd take a seaplane out to save time and only go if I knew water was going to be clear for snorkeling. There are no facilities other than on the boat - the boat had food included in ticket price (not sure what seaplanes offer but think they have a deal with the boat co), a few souvenirs, snacks, and alcoholic beverages available for purchase, and bathrooms.","March 22, 2015",Go if weather is nice; otherwise disappointing,27,"Great Barrington, Massachusetts",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you enjoy the scenic ocean, history & architecture you'll love this adventure.There's plenty of time to snorkel. Head over to where the old steel pilings rise out of the water. That's were all the tropical fish are located. Tip: Skip the picnic tables. Take you lunch up to the second floor, on the far west wall. The view over the water to Logger-Head Key and it's lighthouse is the perfect place to enjoy lunch. It's about a 90-minute trip back and forth by boat. If you get queasy on the water, check the wind speed that day. If it's 20 mph or more, pick a calmer day as it'll be a bumpy ride.If you rather avoid the boat altogether, you can hitch a ride on a seaplane which is much quicker, but nearly twice the cost.","March 21, 2015",Best Day-Trip In the Florida Keys,10,"Key West, Florida, United States",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I had not heard of Dry Tortugas National Park before coming to Key West. That is my fault. This is a really unique and fun place to visit. You need to make a reservation on the boat or on a seaplane - it is far offshore. YOU NEED A RESERVATION FOR THE BOAT. An old fortress built in the mid 1800s covers most of the island and is very historically interesting. There are also two beaches and snorkeling available. I did not do it but many people did snorkel. The boat folks bring all the snorkel gear. It is a long day. 2.5 hours each way on the boat and four hours there. If you have young kids, know what you are getting into. Our boat was full at about 175 and is the only ferry of the day. Mostly adults or kids in their teens. They provide breakfast and lunch.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the "" Yankee Freedom iii "" Ferry Service from the Historic Seaport in Key West to get to this Island. It took about 3 hours through some very rough waters to arrive. This trip is worth it -- considering that transportation to this remote location, guided tour, Breakfast and Lunch are all included in the price.Once you are on the Island, you can do whatever you please for four hours. We checked out the Fort first, had lunch on the boat, and then took the shorter guided tour (45 minutes) at 12.30 PM. It covered most of the Highlights of the Island plus some history about Fort Jefferson.. Then we explored the rest of the Fort on our own.This remote island is a National Park, and is breathtakingly beautiful, complete with white sand beaches and turquoise waters all around.We climbed up to the third level of the Fort, and got some magnificent 360 degree views. The Wall Walk encircling the Fort was a little scary because of the windy day. We could see nothing but miles upon miles of the Ocean on the right. It was amazing.The Fort has a very rich History. We sauntered into Dr. Samuel Mudd's Room, and could feel how futile he, and the other prisoners in here, must have felt to gaze out at nothing but the vast Ocean. While coming back, we saw some very pretty birds.The Park Ranger was very friendly, and answered many questions from the visitors very patiently. The Gift Shop is small, but is adequate for postcards and souvenirs. If you are a collector of the National Parks Quarters, the Cashier will give you some if you ask.We spent 15 minutes in the Video Room with 3-D glasses, and saw some amazing images of the fish and other wildlife found on this island.This is the most difficult National Park to get to, because you have to come to Key West first.

Dry Tortugas National Park,The seaplane ride was spectacular and the views from it were amazing. The swimming area was beautiful. We didn't see too many fish when we snorkeled.

We took the boat which was nice. Breakfast and lunch were served on board. The crew was very helpful and professional. I made sure to give them a decent tip at the end. Ranger Rick was a good source of information. The tours provide a lot of interesting information. Take your Dramamine is you get seasick easily. The boat is big and takes the waves easily, however it is a 2.5 hour boat ride. The snorkeling was very good along the old docks. We did the South side. There were a lot of parrot fish and a few Barracuda to note. A lot of little fish. I wished that I had a short wetsuit. I got cold before I was tired of snorkeling. There were 150 on the island while we were there so we didn't get to experience the full tranquility of the island.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I am an avid military history buff & this is one of the best old military forts I have ever seen. You have to take an airplane or a 2 1/2 hour charter boat ride to get there. The boat ride can be EXTEMELY rough, but the company that runs it takes great care of you. Besides the fort there is a bird sanctuary & a beach you can snokel at. Both the sanctuary & beach were closed when my wife & I were there due to bad weather, but this was still the highlight of our trip to Key West. If you go by charter boat plan to be gone all day from about 7:30 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon. You can also park all day in the city garage across the street from the dock for $10. If you are in to pack in & pack out camping you can also do that here.

Being one of only 20-30 people in the park is amazing.

(i was disappointed but i don't know if there would have been time for a full tour anyway). husband & daughter enjoyed snorkeling while i swam & relaxed under a tree on the beach. i had been hoping to do some birdwatching, but the bird sanctuary was off limits. there were a zillion birds out there (think alfred hitchcock) but without binoculars, there was not much for me to see. there were changing rooms on the dock, and bathrooms available on the ferry while in port. longish lines for both, but happy to have them. half day tour was probably not long enough, but don't know if the full day would be worth the extra money. saw sea turtles & sharks in the water from our plane and a giant barracuda while snorkeling. a great day! highly recommended!","March 11, 2015",a most memorable day!,40,ny,4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"One thing to know about the Dry Tortugas trip is that it is a long boat ride, five+ hours total, for about four hours on the island. The boat trip is not relaxing as the boat travels at about 35 mph over relatively rough water. So it is pretty much sit down and hold on. They push Dramamine at the start of the trip out and back to avoid sea sicknesses. Also, they cram a bunch of people on a relatively small boat so there is a lot of jostling for seating.That said, if you are a history buff or a National Park buff, I think the trip is worth the time and money. I am both, so the trip was a good one for me.However, if you just like to snorkel, kayak and see a beach, there are just as good if not better places near KW to do that without the rather arduous and expensive boat trip.They serve a decent breakfast and a good lunch sandwich lunch.","March 11, 2015",Make sure it is what you want to do.,148,Wa.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The trip to the Dry Tortugas was enjoyable and the cite, itself, was fascinating for anyone that is a history buff, but if you're going there for the snorkeling there are a few things to think about. First, the water where you snorkel can be very choppy and it's not a gradual decline from knee deep water to over-your-head. It's a sharp decline. My 9-year-old girl didn't feel comfortable at all (nor did I) because the water was choppy and too deep. It wasn't even a windy day or in any way concerning--weather wise. I think this is just the way the water is. So, as a fun historic park-yes! As a place to snorkel? There are so many other places more local to Key West with waters that are more calm.","March 11, 2015",Dry Tortugas Snorkeling,33,"Springfield, Vermont",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"A trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park, in a sea plane is back on my bucket list. It's not cheap, so we opted for half a day. It's a day trip, no question. The snorkeling is excellent; you can go around the fort itself in the water, there are migrating birds and white beaches. There is also lots of shade in the fort. Take food and drink, as there is none in the park. The flight itself is worth the trip. Go on the first one (8am) and you'll have the island to yourself as the ferry doesn't arrive until 10:30. You'll probably see shipwrecks, sharks, turtles, rays, dolphins. You can explore the fort on three levels, looking out far to sea.","March 9, 2015",Back on my bucket list,45,"Grand Junction, Colorado",5

I took hundreds of photos, climbed up the lighthouse to the top of the massive brick fort and viewed the restored cannons. We were in Key West, and took the ferry trip despite the very hefty fee to get there. Trip included 2 buffet style meals, ham/turkey sandwich- I made mine into a salad. Salad dressings would have been great to have. Coffee, water, sodas available. The bathrooms - the wait- are a disaster. No place to go but on the boat. People were getting sick and it wasn't even bad out- wind or wave wise. We had a great sunny day in February. Birds were on the other island, and birders were not allowed, only up to a certain point. I saw sand crabs, lots of coral, and some fish.","March 9, 2015","Gorgeous blue hued water, interesting Fort to explore",81,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin",5

Be warned if you get ""sea sick"" or motion sickness this may not be the trip for you .......take the Dramamine they offer you if you don't know for sure. This was a relaxing trip the day we took it, water was pretty calm it did get a little bumpy at times. They offer a simple breakfast so don't think you will be getting some huge buffet its like a continental breakfast at a hotel. The 70 minute trip over was relaxing like I mentioned earlier. One we arrived they offered a guided tour of the fort we opted to tour it ourselves. It's pretty remarkable how it was built and what it was used for. After our tour we ate lunch that was offered it was filling mostly sandwiches, chips, pasta, cookies etc, you won't go hungry with the lunch they offer. We went snorkeling after lunch with the free gear they let us use. If you have never done this you have to try it there it's was great. The water is crystal clear and there are a lot of fish species to see . The ride back was bumpy but they did offer adult beverages on the way back so that alone made it relaxing for us . Try and get seats on the top deck to enjoy the view and the weather. Overall a great day trip, must do once while in key west just to say you have done it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited Key West on Monday, February 16 to catch the Seaplane tour over to Dry Tortugas National Park. My husband and I are great fans of the National Parks. We have been fortunate to visit many over the years. The previous year, in the Florida Keys, we had decided that visiting this National Park should be on our ""to do"" list for when we visited again. The week that we were in the Florida Keys, being in Winter and during record-breaking low temperatures, we were unable to fully enjoy this Park. Other personal factors were involved on that day that took away from the experience also. Transportation out to the Park is expensive, whether going by Ferry or Seaplane. Our main intent was to enjoy some great snorkeling. My rating is solely based on my experience that day, with many factors at play. It would most likely have been a whole different experience and possibly a different rating had the weather been warm and the seas calm. There have been no other National Parks that we have visited that I would rate Average. They are all treasures. I am glad that we went, but I do not feel the need to go again and try for a better experience.","March 3, 2015","My Average rating should not reflect negatively about this National Park. It's based on ""all thing considered.""",100,"Chesapeake, Virginia",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Loved the Dry Tortugas! We were a little concerned about the price, but it was worth every penny! We rented wetsuits the day before from Lost Reef Dive shop (right next to the dock area) and it was a good choice, as the water was pretty chilly. We spent almost 2 hours snorkeling. Great healthy corals, tons of fish. We only managed to do 1/2 of the moat wall area and part of the North Beach pillars, but we saw a ton of marine life. We spent some time birding as well. Unfortunately with all the time spent on the other activities we didn't have much time for the fort, which looked interesting. Would love to have an extra couple hours there. We will camp next time for sure! Boat ride was fine and the waters were really calm. Food was decent and the crew tried hard to give lots of info about the island. Would love to see some kayak rentals on the island for people who don't want to snorkel. Overall excellent experience!!","March 3, 2015",A must see for National Park lovers!,26,"Lima, OH",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our visit to the park via the ""Yankee Freedom"" vessel was a great trip. They have everything well organized on the boat and the staff was very friendly. Breakfast and lunch are provided and the food was very good. We were blessed with calm seas and an easy voyage to and from the park, although we had taken Dramamine just in case!. We enjoyed touring Fort Jefferson and marveled at the engineering feat to build such an expansive structure out in the middle of the ocean. Our highlight, however, was snorkeling in the clear waters. The water was a chilly 68 degrees, but we were going no matter what! We saw lots of colorful fish and beautiful coral formations. We had a wonderful experience and definitely would go back again.","March 1, 2015",Wonderful Trip,32,"Point Pleasant, West Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had a great time on the Dry Tortugas visit. We took the boat, which cost $150 each, to get there but you can also take a seaplane. We thoroughly enjoyed the boat ride and the island too. They serve a light breakfast and lunch on the boat. The trip takes 2 hours and then you come upon the fort out in the middle of the ocean. We took the two tours available and learned a lot about the fort during both of these. We spent too much time on lunch and didn't have time to walk around the island by ourselves. We'd recommend walking around the moat by yourself to really enjoy the remoteness of the island. It was too cool to snorkel when we were there. Interesting - the ferry asks that you take everything off it when you get to the island - everyone just puts it on a picnic table. No problem. We hadn't expected so many people on the boat so, I'd recommend making a reservation. The trip will take the whole day but you'll arrive back in Key West in time to see the sunset. Don't forget this.","March 1, 2015",Fun trip,119,"Des Moines, Iowa",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Arrived in Key West with reservations for a two-night stay, and had a list of museums and attractions to check out during that limited time. Had considered Dry Tortugas during trip planning, and ruled it out as too expensive, plus it takes a whole day. Once on Key West, and seeing the crowds and the lunacy, (and this was BEFORE we even got to Duval Street), we decided to book a trip to the Dry Tortugas, after all. The choices are a high-speed catamaran passenger ferry, which is expensive, or a seaplane, which is VERY expensive. In spite of a pessimistic weather forecast, we went ahead anyway. The first part of the journey was in shallower, more sheltered waters, which allowed us to enjoy the included breakfast on board. Later, in the open channel with a cold front passing through and seas rising to 8-12 feet, we were glad that we had taken Dramamine before boarding. On arrival, it was too cold and the water too churned up, even in the shelter of the island, to do any snorkeling. Having said all this, we were still delighted that we chose to make the trip. The National Park is mostly about the fort, built of brick in the 1800's, one of the largest brick structures anywhere, which occupies about 90% of the island. The history is palpable, and can be learned from a tour led by a National Park ranger or one of the ferry/concessionaire's staff, or by a leisurely self tour. A lunch buffet, served on the boat while still tied to the dock completes the package. I would caution those who suffer severely from seasickness to consider carefully, but on a calm, warm, sunny day this day excursion would be a delight. As it was, we still felt it worthwhile.","February 28, 2015",One of the least-visited National Parks,33,"Shelton, Washington",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the day ferry to Dry Tortugas NP. Thought it would be a long day but was just perfect. Cost was $160 per person. A little steep but well worth it. They provided a great breakfast and lunch and then cash bar after 2:00. Ride over and back was fairly smooth. They predicted a little rough ride due to 3 feet seas. They suggested Dramaminne so most people took but all it did was make everybody fall asleep on the way over so skip it unless you have history of being seasick. Ferry was comfortable and clean. Spent about 5 hours at the park. We toured around ourselves. Some folks did the free tours. Plenty of history, sightseeing, beaches, gift shop,photo ops and picnic table for eating lunch. They provide snorkling equipment with the cost of the ride but the water a little too cool in February. 70 degrees and sunny.Perfect weather for sightseeing. It would be very hot in the middle of summer. Fantastic views, history and scenery. Water is blue and perfectly clear. They do have overnight camping for a few spots.","February 28, 2015",Ferry to Dry Tortugas/Fort Jefferson,8,"Bay Village, Ohio",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our pilot said that missing this attraction would be like not seeing the pyramids when in Egypt. He was right! This is an astonishing place--and flying there over the beautiful water was incredibly beautiful. This Civil War fort is the definition of over-estimating the enemy: I will never be able to understand why the US thought it needed a fort this big and 126 giant cannons able to train their sights on a single ship 3 miles away. Whaa? Anyway, the snorkeling is also very good by the pilings and I can see the attraction of this place for campers. The stars must be beautiful. We were there 4 hours and it was not enough to see the whole fort and go snorkeling (I had only 5 mins to snorkel and saw maybe 1/5 of the fort and wasn't on a tour. Wish we had a guide because we missed a lot of information by just wandering and reading signage). And I would love to be there with a naturalist when birds are migrating. But a whole day in the sun could be daunting for some...","February 27, 2015",GO HERE! Worth the expense and time,43,"Lake Forest, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We decided to book this excursion while staying in Key West and were glad that we did. Even though the snorkeling and actual beach area were a bit disappointing, the tour of Jefferson Fort and learning of its rich history translated into a really enjoyable experience. The waters surrounding the beach area itself, while beautiful, we're not conducive to non swimmers, as there is a significant drop very close to shore. My husband and son were looking forward to seeing some interesting marine life while snorkeling but were disappointed along with everyone else. As for the trip over on the Yankee Freedom- great! The staff were skilled, knowledgeable, super accommodating and kept you informed of the conditions on the water every step of the way. Breakfast and lunch exceeded my expectations!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I've been there twice, both times by sea. We own our own sailing vessel and it's close to Miami. This is the furtherest southern fort in the USA. Never a shot has been fired here. Mudd was interred here after setting John Wilkes Booth's leg (assassinator of Lincoln) after he jumped from the balcony and broke his leg. The authorities figures Mudd was in on it and threw him in the brigg on this island. The fort is pretty well intact. If you come with the sea plane or the ship take their tour. you have to have all your own water and food (hence the word ""Dry ...""). The rangers are very knowledgable and helpful and if you show an interest they will give you some interesting facts and trivia about the island. It depends which rangers are there at the time, some are more helpful than others. Watch the weather window very closely. Take dramamine if you take the ship. It's rarely a smooth ride from the mainland to the island. If you are a diver go down on the old White Fleet coal docks, if you aren't a diver and have snorkle gear to that. The moat is still there and you can see mound after mound indicating conch. This is a national monument so no fishing or anything. One thing you can pick up on these beaches that you no longer find on the mainland beaches is seaglass. I guess the stuff is coming in from the beaches of Cuba; we haven't allowed glass on our beaches for a long time. It's hard to tell you what will be there when you get there as it is constantly changing. One year a young ranger put on a fabulous slide show that he created, the other ranger gave us a guided tour, underwater, of the coal docks. A warning for sailors ... the last time we went (January) we got stuck in a 9-day squall. We hunkered in for 9-days taking night watches for the anchor. It was scary, a nightmare and we actually saw a boat get washed up on the coral reef and the rangers graciously went out to rescue the boat. Be very very careful. Make sure you have enough line, a really good anchor, and enough provisions to get stuck for a while should the weather turn. My advise is go by sea plane or small tour ship. The tour ship feeds you very well. Defintely worth the trip! It's a piece of our history","February 27, 2015",Dry Tortugas,29,"Melbourne, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I went to Key West the first week of June 2014, the main focus of our trip being the Dry Tortugas National Park. Drove the entire way in one go (18+ hours), and I have to say...COMPLETELY WORTH IT! It rained much of the time we were there, a light drizzle really, but worth it all the same. Snorkeling is available right off the beach; the Yankee Freedom provides snorkel gear, but I recommend bringing your own, especially if you are camping. Free is nice, but any snorkel stuff you buy is going to be better automatically. We camped, and even though the sleeping itself was challenging in 90 degree, high humidity weather in a tent, just take a Benedryl and call it a night. Camping really makes a difference, because once the boat leaves, you have the fort and the beaches pretty well to yourself. Did I mention the fort? No? Well, it's amazing. If camping, I recommend touring it on your own first thing in the morning. You'll have the place almost entirely to yourself aside from the random park ranger now and again. The Yankee Freedom staff were helpful and efficient, the food wasn't fancy, but it hits the spot after a long day of swimming and getting sunburned, and the ride itself isn't bad. I will say it's much more choppy going than coming, but it doesn't seem to take any time at all going back, since the long wait to see the place is over. Also, the bar opens on the way back, and the drinks are pretty tasty. Words of warning: Wear sunscreen and bring protective clothing! I am very fair skinned, so I planned appropriately by bringing a wide brimmed hat, a sun shirt, and spf 100 sunscreen, reapplying every hour, and I still had rosy cheeks by the end of this. My husband opted out of the hat, and his poor face suffered the consequences. Bottom line: wear sunscreen! You are closer to the equator. I know it's gross and sticky, but blisters ruin vacations. The only downside to this whole thing is really only applicable to campers. The camping is primitive, so no running water. This was only a problem when having to use the can, because the only facilities are composting toilets. Just go to your happy place when using them and move on, and you'll be fine. Anyways, great trip. I shall return!","February 26, 2015",Beautiful place! Would go again!,25,"Moulton, Alabama",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom III tour over for the day. It was very well organized and gave us a great way to try a variety of things while there for 4+ hours. We walked the fort all around inside and around the moat outside, walked as close as we could down to the rookery, and debated snorkeling, but decided it was too chilly for us. The ranger on site was interesting and the display in the visitor center is well done. The ferry crew also gave shortened tours of the fort, but we did the walking one on our own. This is not an easy place to walk, as there are steep steps inside to the top tiers, so many elderly wandered the grounds then went to one of the beaches. The fort is maintained in original condition as much as possible, so no guard rails; be aware of this if you bring children. It never seemed overrun with visitors, even when all 175 of us from the ferry were ashore. Worth the $$ to visit. Used our National Park Pass for free admittance.","February 26, 2015",Lots to do and see here for the fit,1078,"Vonore, Tennessee",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the excursion by the Yankee Clipper to the Fort Jefferson/Dry Tortugas National Park. It is a full day tour, from about 8 am to 6pm. The tour provided breakfast on the boat on the way there, about 70 miles by water, and also lunch at the Fort. The ride itself is worth the price. The Fort is incredible. So large, one can only imagine what kind of statement it made when it was bristling with many dozens of those huge cannons. Guided tours of the fort are available, or you can simply stroll the grounds by yourself. Swimming and snorkeling (gear provided) at the fort gives your feet a bit of a rest. Lots of walking, lots of stairs to get to the top of the fort walls. Not real friendly for someone in a wheelchair.","February 25, 2015",An amazing piece of American History,26,Saskatoon,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Just came back from a trip to the Florida Keys with a highlight of visiting Dry Tortuga Park ( Feb 20-22). It was windy and stormy so the boat ride was challenging. The Island is very small but the history is fascinating. It is very worthwhile to take a free tour from the park ranger. We stayed to camp as well. Had lots of privacy and is very enjoyable if you are prepared. There is no running water so you need to bring your own. The compostable toilets are great, much better than the average park toilets. Unfortunate part is that we wanted to snorkel. February is definitely not the time frame for it. Park host said that the best time is in May/June. Last but not least the Yankee ferry was a bit unpredictable in their coming and going to the island. Everyday was a maybe we will come and maybe we won't. In the end we cut our camping by a day because they said they were not coming and we didn't want to get stranded.","February 24, 2015",Time your visit well,20,"Maple Valley, Washington",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"When we discovered this was off the Keys and we saw all the history and the gorgeous water to snorkel in we knew we had to go. We purchased our tickets and rode out there on the Yankee Clipper III and Paul was out tour guide. He did a fantastic job. The ferry ride is pretty spot on at 2.5 hours each way. Going there was uneventful. Coming back we hit some rough water with big rolling swells and so those that did not take Dramamine were outside letting loose in bags provided, It was never unsafe, more like a great big roller coaster in the Gulf. The fort was so impressive when you first see it on the horizon about 25 minutes before you get there. It keeps getting bigger and bigger and you look around and there are just a few tiny little barrier islands and around and that's it and you wonder how did all this brick and mortar and cannons get here? You could literally spend a few days out there and still not be able to take it all in. We are thinking next time we go we will camp out there with the permits you can obtain through the park service.It had been windy and cold the days leading up to us arriving and was still windy the day we arrived but I still went snorkeling with my underwater GoPro and with the water being about 68 degrees I was fine. The water was cloudy because of the wind so the ability to see a great deal was not that good.We highly recommend taking a day of your vacation and going out there because it is spectacular!","February 24, 2015",Remote and worth the Trip,25,SSI,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas National Park is a must-see spot about 70 miles off the coast from Key West, FL. What a history! Ponce de Leon dropped anchor here in 1513. He found the waters teeming with green, hawksbill, leatherback, and loggerhead turtles, and so named the islands las tortugas, which means ""the turtles."" It is 64,000 acres. Almost 200 ships wrecked in this area since the 1600s. The first lighthouse was build in 1825. In 1846, the US Army began building a pentagonal shaped fort on the island. The outer walls of the fort remain to this day. For a time, the fort served as a prison for Civil War POWs, including Dr. Samuel Mudd, who was arrested and sent there for aiding John Wilkes Booth. The US Navy took over the Dry Tortugas in 1898, but the fort was finally abndoned in 1907. In 1935, FDR declared the Dry Tortugas a National Park.The Dry Tortugas are west of Key West, near the Gulf of Mexico. It can be visited by taking a tourist ferry out of Key West harbor. The ride takes approximately 2.5 hours. But, it is very much worth the trip.","February 20, 2015",Historical & Educational,11,"Baltimore, Maryland",4

My boyfriend and I took lots of photos while walking in, around and top of the fort and trust me, there is no bad photo that will ever come out of your camera! The place is just that beautiful! Then we snorkelled at the designated area ( worn wetsuit as water tends to be cold during Feb month based on my research before coming here) and initially the snorkel right at the corner of the fort wasn't that fruitful. But we discovered the spot right in front of the fort where there are birds on top of rustic barges, there lies thousands of fishes with 4-6 ft long barracudas!!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"First things first - do not take the ferry over - take the Key West Seaplane ride. It's a 30 minute flight and you don't use up your entire day. (We left at 8am, and were back in Key West for lunch).That being said, this place is truly amazing. First of all, the fort takes up 13 acres of the mere 19 acres of land out in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. So when you're flying in, all you see is this structure out in the middle of the water. Crazy. The fort itself is really cool. We explored it for about 30 minutes and then took a walk around the fort, along the walkway surrounding the moat. That was pretty cool too.We then headed to the beach for some snorkeling. Although this particular day was pretty cool and super windy, so we only stuck a toe in for a bit.

Thank goodness we took the advice of the guides and took Dramamine, because we needed it. The ferry was full to capacity & we were in close quarters. You get breakfast, lunch & water/coffee. If they say at the beginning to take the Dramamine, take it, they know what their talking about. The guides & mates are very helpful & knowledgeable. Unfortunately, we did not do any snorkeling due to the rough waters, some just laid on the beach. Took a tour in the fort, you can do a self guided tour or with a tour guide. The self guided to seemed fine & everything is well marked, with boards to explain some of the areas. Basic breakfast & lunch is cold cuts & a chicken salad.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I have been here several times, via different ferry services over the years and I never get tired of going. There is so much history associated with the HUGE Fort Jefferson Fort that occupies a large portion of the park. Tours of the fort are offered at no extra charge. The snorkeling is fantastic - especially around the moat. Great place for birding as well. I should mention that the water can be cold in the winter months and you may need a wetsuit. The ferry service provides the rest of the snorkel gear, but not wetsuits. The cost is quite high to go on the Ferry - $ 170-$ 180, which is the only way to go unless you have a friend with a boat. A nice breakfast and lunch are served and it takes about 2.5 hrs each way with about 4 hours at the park. It is a long day, but it will be memorable. I would advise taking a camera for all the amazing shots of the fort and looking down from on the top level of the fort. Also take a hat - the sun can be quite strong. This one trip you will always remember.","February 17, 2015",Put this place on your list,24,"Rehoboth Beach, Delaware",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"You can look at all the photos you want and read the descriptions but it's like looking at a postcard of Mount Rushmore: You just won't ""get it"" until you go. Visiting here is a historical, scenic adventure. There are times when you can go and do an overnight, which I would love to go back for, but a day trip out away from all sights and sounds of the world means peaceful, carefree wonder. Time feels stopped here. The fort/prison is formidable, but also very fascinating when you take in the history. Walking around the tortuga itself and off on tangents, even with a couple hundred people visiting in a day, you can still find isolation.I recommend snorkeling also. It was only my second time trying and while it takes a bit to get the hang of, just lying in the very warm water looking down at a vast variety of small (and sometimes alarmingly large) fish swimming just beneath. Just a fabulous, relaxing and inspiring day. Do it. You will not regret it.","February 13, 2015",Once in a lifetime adventure for pirates and swabbies alike,70,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Either way, you get to visit the park for a little over 2 hours. We opted for the seaplane: the plane holds 10 and flys at about 500 feet. The views of the gulf and the various sealife were incredible. The fort itself is the largest brick structure in the western hemisphere. There are snorkeling opportunities around the small island, self-guided or volunteer led (Kevin was our adopted field guide) tours of the fort, and a multitude of birds on the island for watching. The views of the surrounding gulf from the top of the fort are breathtaking. We packed a lunch (carry in/carry out) (drinks provided by seaplane company) and ate at a table while a crocodile in the fort moat sized us up.

We were lucky to see Carlos, a crocodile that is known to inhabit the moat on our trip. There is a small beach area where you can enjoy the water and snorkel as well. Definitely would recommend this trip and would go again. One caution- the sea was pretty rough on our trip over and MANY were sea sick. Take Dramamine!

The fort is a big 3 story circle, like the coliseum, but without the architecture. It's pretty plain, but you can wander around and on top. There aren't a lot of people there, and there aren't fences all over the place keeping you from bumping your head while tying your shoe, or falling 40 feet to your death. Careful with the toddlers. There are big guns to show boys of all ages. Outside, you can walk the edges of the fort and look down into the water and see some fish and coral.

The island itself is a beautiful setting, and after walking around the fort you can snorkel or just take a nap on the beach. But in hindsight it's a lot of money for not much of a historic attraction, and you can snorkel other places for a lot less. The ferry ride itself is half the fun, although it seemed like they spent half of the three hour trip on the loudspeaker giving tons of instructions (so much so, that I think most people just stopped listening). The day we went was very rough and the crew was really great about taking care of everyone that was queasy or sick.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Be prepared folks, this isn't a quick jaunt out and back. It's a three hour ferry ride out, five hours on a tiny tiny island and three hour ferry ride back. It isn't cheap at $170. The Yankee Freedom is the only boat with service to the island. it takes only one trip of about 150 people a day. You can also take a sea plane.That being said, i absolutely loved it!. Being one to get motion sick fairly easily, i brought my own Dramamine (they were selling pills a dollar each) and was VERY glad i did. Parts of the trip were through the channel which had 3 foot swells rolling the boat up and down. I popped that dramamine and napped for a good portion of the ride. I HIGHLY SUGGEST being in the upstairs/outside portion facing out the back. The fresh air really helps and if you face forward there is a horrible horizon reflection that rocks up and down in a way guaranteed to bring your breakfast back up. Don't forget your sunscreen!The Yankee Freedom has a very basic cold continental breakfast and make-your-own-sandwich lunch. Don't expect gourmet and michelin stars, it's a camping-like experience. There's no water on the island (thus the ""dry"") and all water, trash, amenities are boated in and out. Be respectful and be prepared. The only bathrooms are on the ferry, and there's always a line. So the island itself- What a gem! it's surrounded by the most beautiful water. A fort takes up much of the island, theres interesting history on it's strategic location and construction. a little island connected by a narrow spit of land was covered with birds and off limits due to the birds migrating through.We took a tour with Mike the park ranger around the outside of the fort, looking and learning about corals, fish, birds, nearby islands and the building.We even saw Carlos the Crocodile, blown out to the fort during a hurricane and usually hiding from the tourists. He swam down and was at our feet in the water! we were thrilled!After our tour we made ourselves sandwiches and walked around the fort. They have self guided tour signs but we skipped through, happy to explore on our own. we went all the way to the top and walked around. This isn't disney world, there are no railings or roped off areas so exercise common sense and caution and don't go hurting yourself!We proudly got our national parks passport books stamped. I love getting rare or hard to reach stamps!Next we got complimentary snorkel gear from the boat and went snorkin around. It hadn't rained recently so visibility was really great in the water. The old pylons is definitely the place to see a big variety of plants and fish. Because of our tour with Ranger Mike we recognized more stuff than we would have. Thanks Mike! And because we waited til the second half of the day to snorkel it wasn't crowded with other boat people. The boat had fresh water showers to wash the salt off which was great. we settled down, took our second dose of dramamine and napped home. We had good weather and enjoyed ourselves greatly!

The guides suggested that if you even have the slightest thought of sea sickness take the Dramamine. Even I did about an hour of the trip to the island was rough.a few people had a rough go of it. But once there the island was quite interesting. Being breezy one could be wearing a light jacket or if you are out of the wind down to swim suit. It was too choppy for me to do any snorkeling.

Fort Jefferson, an immense structure was amazing and encompasses the whole island. You could explore every level and walk around the whole structure on a walkway that creates a mote.

We arrived at the Dry Tortugas & Fort Jefferson at 10:30. Lunch buffet was served from 11AM - 1PM. Lots of sandwich fixings, soda, chips, etc. that were very good and fresh. Picnic tables on shore are available. Snorkeling equipment was available to all for no extra charge, although we opted to bring our own. We chose to eat lunch, take the one hour narrated tour of the fort, and then swim/snorkel. Water was 73 degrees. We had to be back to the ferry by 2:45 for a 3PM departure back to Key West. Snacks were available and the cash bar was open for the cruise back. All in all, it was an excellent day....we lucked out and had very sunny warm weather.Things to note: The parking garage is close to the ferry terminal, easy to get to, as well as out of Key West and it is very well lit.Inside the ferry the seats are set up at tables for meals, Deck chairs are available outside for nice days.There is no fresh water on the island. Fresh water rinse showers & toilets are available on the ship. Island toilets are for tent campers only. The ferry has water, soda, etc.There are changing facilities available on the island.The fort is the largest brick structure on the east coast. We were only able to tour a small portion as we wanted some beach/snorkel time. There are a lot of unlit spiral stairs and brick walkways. Wear comfortable footgear.The island can be reached by sea plane or private boat also.Bird and fish life is abundant. There is also a crocodile.There was no cell service! Refreshing!Pros: Ferry staff, the tour of the fort, trip narration, food, drinks, Mother NatureCons: Cost, not enough hours to explore Fort Jefferson and snorkelBring sun screen and enjoy history and nature!","January 29, 2015",Dry Tortugas National Park via Yankee Freedom Ferry,59,SPRING HILL,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We made a day trip to Dry Tortugas on the Yankee Freedom Ferry on New Years Eve. The park itself is a gem. Snorkeling was pretty good though my 7 and 8 year old kids found the water a little cold for their tastes. Old Fort Jefferson was spectacular and a lot of fun to explore. After checking out the fort and the snorkeling we took a walk to explore Bush Key (though it appears as a separate island on many maps, a land brige has formed between it and Garden Key). Since hardly anyone else ventured far from the fort we felt like we had the whole beach to ourselves. (The staff on the ferry noted that this section was closed during certain times to protect nesting sea birds so it would not always be an option). The ferry staff was great, food and beverages were decent. The only downside is that there is a lot of travel time involved (about 2 1/2 hours each way) and we felt like we could have spent more time in the Tortugas. I think the overnight camping would definitely add to the experience and would probably spend the night if I was going to do it again. Ferry tickets were on the pricey side but still worth it. Book ahead during peak times as they do sell out.","January 29, 2015",Great Out of the Way National Park,55,"Oxford, Ohio",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a plane which was nice and quick. Got there at around 8:45am, the water was freezing. I went snorkeling because after spending almost $600 for 2 of us, I was going to see some fish. I saw exactly ONE fish even though I went in where the pilot recommended. There were two planes and I think there was 24 people and only four of us had the guts to get in. The visitors bureau and Best of Key West assured me that the water would be nice even in the morning and that the snorkeling would be good. Neither was true. I have heard Dry Tortugas is amazing at other times of the year, specifically summer. On the plus side, the fort was pretty cool.","January 28, 2015",Not in January,1,"San Jose, California",2

The ferry departs daily at 8 a.m. and includes a buffet continental breakfast, buffet lunch, snorkel gear, and tour of Fort Jefferson. The boat ride is about 2 1/2 hours out to Fort Jefferson. The water is crystal clear. Very interesting place to go. We had recently returned from a trip to the Galapagos Islands and can see why they call this the Galapagos of the western hemisphere. Highly recommend!!","January 28, 2015",A great retreat from everything,12,"Geneva, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,This is a great day trip to take. We took the boat out and back. I would probably take the seaplane if I ever went again. The tour guides were good but personally liked walking around on my own better. Lunch was pretty simple as was breakfast. Loved that they played captain Ron on the trip back. Would recommend to any one that likes nature or history.

The fort is huge but not all parts are open. The park ranger who did our tour was very knowledgeable and well spoken. He didn't rush us at all.We saw rare birds that return there ever year so the trip went beyond history and covered nature also.

We were able to climb up to the top of the fort and walk around, great view! The beaches are beautiful, perfect spot to take an afternoon nap (which I did!). We didn't snorkel because the water was cold but some brave souls did and seemed to enjoy themselves. I would highly recommend this day trip for anyone visiting the Keys.

The seaplane pilot had so much to offer about the wrecks we passed over and the turtles etc. we could easily see from the plane. Beautiful place but the signage was poorly done and there was little interpretive literature available. We understand that the snorkeling is amazing; however, too cold in January for amateurs without the proper equipment. While respectful of the history and the incredible effort it took to build this place, we couldn't help but wonder if preserving it was worth the money as it is so inaccessible.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We went camping for one night in August for my birthday. It was SO hot. Thank God we brought a battery operated fan. We were counting on the ocean breeze that we constantly get on the east coast of Florida, but it was dead. No wind whatsoever. There were also a lot of ants and hermit crabs all over the campsites. You could hear the hermit crabs moving all night long. And there are definitely rats that come out at night like everyone warns you about. Didn't really deal with mosquitoes. We were told to bring at least two gallons of water per person per day. We ended up not even using half of that amount, but someone left a 2 gallon jug with a spout that we used for rinsing off and that was a lifesaver. The toilets are gag-worthy. They smell awful. But you're on an island with no running water or electricity. Once everyone left - it was incredible. Had the whole island to ourselves. The snorkeling was awesome around the fort. The sunset was beautiful. The stars are absolutely stunning. We could hear the fighter jets practicing late at night and occasionally saw them really high up in the sky. There were glowing things in the water around the fort at night. We took the Yankee Freedom boat, which was a long ride, but nice. The showers on board have hot water, but you can't use soap...and they're out in the open. The staff was super friendly, answered all our questions, and helped carry all of camping gear on and off the boat. This was one of the most memorable trips I've ever taken.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the seaplane to the island first thing in the morning so we basically had the whole island to ourselves until midday, so peaceful. This is such a unique place and full of so much to see for such a small island.Firstly we walked around the moat wall that give you wonderful views of the fort and into the water with the colourful fish. Make sure you put some shoes on as the ground is a big rough. Some of my best holiday photos are of this walk.Secondly we walked in the fort and along the top, its interesting reading the history and looking out at the elevated views of the surrounding areas.Lastly we went snoring near the main entrance, this didn't offer the best viewing but I was taking a fist timer child snoring so nice a safe. There are better areas around the far side of the fort and out a little way. Be warned the a 7ft alligator lives there now but I would say its harmless as there was not warnings and everyone was still getting in the water.There is very limited serves on the island so make sure you take everything you need (equipment, food, drink).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The time you spend at Dry Tortugas National Park is fantastic. The snorkling is great. The fort is very cool. Unless part of your excitement for the day is the boat ride itself, it is an awful long boat ride for the time dedicated to the park. Roughly 1/2 the day is spent on the boat and 1/2 the day on the island. If you are in a group, you need to board early or you won't get seats together inside the boat. They sell individual dramamine packets ($1 each) before and during the trip because the chop can cause people to get sick. Kids can do the ranger program and get an ice cream on the ride home, though my kids were a bit old for that.I wish they had lockers to store your car keys and what not so that the family could snorkel together.","January 18, 2015",Great snorkle; long boat ride,37,"Cornwall, New York",4

The staff was terrific, hear great facts and was served 2 meals, snorkel gear available as an option, along with a small group tour of the fort.The seaplane is much more expensive by several hundred dollars depending on 1/2 day or full day options.And since I don't know anyone with a private boat...ah well...we took the Yankee Freedom.Such a quiet, remote and interesting place the Dry Tortugas are!

We walked toward Bush Key and enjoyed the pelicans diving for fish, as well as frigate birds and other wildlife. We saw a barracuda, sea stars and lots of crabs. We did not get to see turtles, however! The food and service on board the ferry are excellent. Our only complaint is that there was not enough time to explore and enjoy the beauty of the island.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took a seaplane excursion to Dry Tortugas National Park. Once I arrived I was on my own. It would have been helpful if someone was available at the Park to answer questions or provide tours. The company that provided the transportation to the park noted the snorkeling opportunities and where to enter the park and that was it. Knowing I had about 3 hours, I hit the fort first. Truly it would have been helpful to have a guide. I walked the perimeter of the fort top and bottom, read the plagues that explained some facts, but the experience felt lacking. Then I donned my fins and goggles and tried to snorkel. Hit the beach side first. Found some pretty areas, but was not sure how far to go. Got out and went by land to the other section our pilot recommended. More folks there, but again was unsure how far to go, what was safe or where to look. I did some coral and fish, but feel like if a local had been on hand to guide me, the experience could have been phenomenal stead of marginal.","January 15, 2015",Beautiful Location,65,"Sarasota, Florida",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Dry Tortugas is one of the least visited of the national parks, probably since its 70 miles west of Key West and you can only get there by boat or seaplane. The ferry, the Yankee Freedom, ferries up to 160 people every day and only 1 or 2 seaplanes visit daily, so you basically get the island to yourself. The ferry there is 2-1/2 hours each way, so be patient or take the plane. The fort is interesting and you can take a tour, walk around inside or go up on the walls for long views. You can also snorkle & swim or walk around the moat looking for the resident crocidile (he's harmless). The stroll to Bush key was interesting especially near the end where the beach is littered with broken coral and shells, looking like the boneyard early visitors thought it was. Birdwatching is good too. Those with children would be wise to go when the water is warm enough for swimming, since 4 hours there might be too much without burning off some excess energy in the water for the youngsters. Its a fun day trip, if you like history or a private beach.","January 14, 2015",A national park all to yourself,240,"Noblesville, Indiana",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This excursion is a must if you are visiting the Keys. The Yankee Freedom tour may seem a bit pricey at first but you get a lot for your money. The trip is about 70 miles in a little over two hours in a high-speed boat, which is very new and in excellent shape. Breakfast and lunch are included, snorkelling gear is also provided on the island. The marine life is good, as is the bird-watching. Since access is a bit complicated, there are no crowds and you get a beautiful beach in Southern Florida that you only have to share with a handful of people - how cool is that? You should book ahead to be sure to have a spot. TIP on beating the weather: book for two or more days and then cancel the ones you do not need before 3 PM the day before to get a full refund. If you have no reservation and they are full, best to go to the pier anyway to see if anyone cancelled or did not show up.","January 9, 2015",Visit one of the least-visited national parks in the country!,76,"Prangins, Switzerland",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This place is a LOT to see and do. Unfortunately, because it takes several hours to get there and back, you only have 4 hours on the island. Plan ahead. The night before pack your backpack. Bring a windbreaker, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a good camera. If you plan to do snorkeling, a bathing suit and waterproof camera is great. Don't bring valuables since there are no lockers and you must bring everything off the boat with you. A backpack left onshore should be just fine, but why worry? Also, bring dramamine and cash to give a modest tip to the staff. We got caught by surprise with little cash and felt bad that we could only tip a small amount.In planning your day, Start with the fort. It has an amazing history and the tour will just whet your appetite. Make sure that as soon as they bring the signup sheets out on the boat ride that you go and sign up. The 11 am tour fills up quickly. Then you can spend time exploring and photographing the fort. After this, I recommend going to the boat and getting your lunch. Pack it up and take it with you to the bird island. There you can sit and watch pelicans dive for fish. Then walk the 1 mile trail while looking at beautiful shells. Don't take any shells with you. Other travelers left them for you, please leave them for others. Should you decide to go snorkeling, realize that you will mostly see sand and coral. The fish varieties are not that prolific. This may be due to the time of year we went. But most snorkelers we talked with were not impressed. We didn't have time to snorkel and the day was a bit windy. So I really would say that if you're not into snorkeling, enjoy the ocean views from the fort. If you are into snorkeling, you might be slightly disappointed. Bring books for the rides there and back. It's 2 1/2 hours. I slept all the way back. I did this by getting the inmost rows inside the boat as most people wanted the window seats or upper decks. Plus, dramamine makes you sleepy. Plus, I'd been up since 5 am! So if you get boat sick, sleeping was a great option. Otherwise, bring a good book or a game of cards. The boat ride back was filled with people enjoying fun games and books.","January 8, 2015",Plan time wisely,24,"Nashua, New Hampshire, United States",4

The beach and camping areas are absolutely beautiful. We walked the moat wall with the captain of the ship, and he showed the boys his resident octopus ~ we snorkeled in the gorgeous blue water and had a grown up cocktail on the way home.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We stumbled upon Dry Tortugas by accident. It is not a well known place to visit and I've never heard anyone talk about it before. We went there with the Yankee Freedom ferry. A 2,5 hour journey. Long but worth it! On the island you can do a self guided tour. It's about 45 minutes maybe. You walk around the fort. Pretty interesting! After that we did some snorkeling. There are some nice spots, with beautiful coral and fishes. Along side the forts wall, were some amazing things to see. There is also the opportunity to camping on the island. You have to take your own stuff along.You pay some dollars but well worth the trip. Considering there are relatively not so many visitors in this National Park compared to some others. But perhaps that is because it is one of the most difficult NPs to visit in the US.","January 7, 2015",Expensive but worth it!,266,"Singapore, Singapore",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"You can only get to Fort Jefferson by seaplane or ferry. We chose the 2 1/2 hour ferry boat ride, and we weren't disappointed. There was a continental breakfast soon after we left the dock, with plenty of time on board to read, nap, watch one of the boat's orientation videos, or just enjoy the ride. On the island you can take advantage of the guided tour (included) or walk through the fort on your own. Snorkeling gear is also included, with well marked areas all around the outside of the moat. While passengers are off the boat, a nice lunch buffet was set up. And after lunch there was plenty of time for more swimming or laying on the beach. On the ride back to Key West there were alcoholic beverages (and souvenirs) available for purchase. If you go, be prepared for a full day; the boat leaves at 8:30 and returns at 5:30. I guarantee you will have a wonderful day.","January 6, 2015",My new favorite National Park,83,"Berkley, Michigan",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was blown away by the fort and this island. If you take the ferry, TAKE DRAMAMINE as it is a long boat tour. Take a walk around the island and the moat, which provides a really contemplative and magical scene. Snorkeling is good, and the water is clear. Lots of animal life, hardly any people. This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. We also took our 2-year-old son. The boat trip was long, but he really enjoyed the beach and running around the inside of the fort. Just hold onto your children if you do choose to climb to the top of the fort. If you take the ferry, it is very handicap accessible. There are no bathrooms on the fort ,but there are on the ferry. There is also food on the ferry, which was nice.","January 6, 2015",Most beautiful island in the US,14,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped one night here, through Yankee Freedom Ferry (great - see separate review), and it was the perfect way to spend a little more time on the island than the day trip. Although, I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was, even when all the daytrippers were there, so if that's all you have time for, it's still a great experience - not too crowded, and a good amount of time to see the fort and take a nice walk and get some swimming/snorkeling in. We did all of those things, and also got to watch a great sunset and see a gazillion stars that night. It's truly magical to be one of only a couple dozen (at most) people on this little spit of land, miles away from anything approaching civilization.The snorkeling was great - saw lots of colorful fish, including barracudas, as well as a stingray! Also got to see Carlos, the resident crocodile in the moat! But don't worry, he's very shy.Highly highly recommend.","January 5, 2015",Like nothing else!,21,"Los Angeles, California",5

The flight from the airport to Dry Tortugas was beautiful and insightful. We snorkeled & walked around the Fort for around 2-3 hours and then flew back to Key West. You can take a Catamaran over, but then your are traveling with a much larger group & it is an all day deal. We thought the shorter trip and flight was the way to go. But it really depends on what you want to experience and pay.","January 5, 2015",A Great Adventure!,21,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Dry Tortugas National Park is unlikely any other. One of my goals is to visit every US National Park and I'm so glad I took this trip. My fiance and I planned a trip to Key West for New Years about a month before we actually went (procrastinators, I know) and we got the last 2 seats on the ferry over to Dry Tortugas. A little FYI, there is only one ferry, the Yankee Freedom, and the $170 ticket includes breakfast, lunch, and snorkeling gear. The 2.5 hour ride to the island and back isn't terrible, you can read, sleep, talk with your group, etc. However, my main complaint with the ferry is that they serve breakfast immediately once you board. There is upper cabin and sundeck seating upstairs and then lower cabin seating downstairs where the breakfast buffet is. They should ask everyone to get seated first and then let people go to the breakfast bar after. It was a ridiculous chore to try to find a seat with all the people waiting in line for food like they haven't eaten in 2 weeks. Once all that craziness settled down it was more tolerable. Lunch is much better as you can take it off the boat and picnic. As for the park itself it's incredible! You have the option to take a guided tour with a ranger or you can explore Fort Jefferson yourself. We opted to do a self guided tour and explored all 3 levels of the fort. It's amazing to see this massive brick structure with nature slowly but surely reclaiming it. It's a photographers dream! The moat walk is nice and you get to see the island from all sides. The water surrounding Garden Key was beautiful blue! We went snorkeling along the moat walls and saw coral and fish, it was amazing! We were also able to go to the beach on Bush Key (which is sometimes closed to the public for bird breeding) and it was just incredible. The plants on the island are gorgeous and everything about it was just wonderful. If we ever go back we may look into the camping option as we just didn't feel like we had enough time to explore all that this national park has to offer!","January 5, 2015",Must See if You're In Key West!,10,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

Way too long to stay on this island. I heard the ferry was not much better although that is a 2.5 hour ride and my understanding is that a lot of people were seasick.

The day myself and my fiance traveled to the Dry Tortuga it was 68 degrees Fahrenheit and winds of 18 mph or greater. The winds caused the ferry ride over to be rough for those that are not great on the seas. Even Dramamine was ineffective for some. The tour of the fort was great, however, once the tour was done there was not much to do due to the fact that with the temperature and wind and being overcast the whole time it was not ideal for snorkeling or even laying on the gorgeous beaches. I imagine the fort is amazing on those hot calm sunny days, however, pack cautiously when traveling.

Snorkeling in the waters around the fort is also a must do. I've seen so many different fish, squid, schools of fish and had an very up close and personal encounter with a friendly 7' Nurse Shark.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This trip is expensive but well worth the expense. Our party of 7 was able to fly out to one of the furthest islands on the Florida Keys by booking a sea plane tour in advance. 8-11 am seems like a short amount of time but it was the perfect amount to experience this great place and we arrived before the larger boat tour that comes into dock around 10:30a. The fort is very fun to walk around by following ""the man,"" a picture soldier who guides you around each level of the fort. The views from the top are phenomenal and the water on a bright day is clear as glass. If you do the tour first then you can get a good idea of where to snorkel. DO NOT MISS the snorkeling experience. The water is beautifully clear and once you feel comfortable do swim away from the wall. There are many many things to see and because so few people visit this island you won't feel crowded. This trip is very fun for those people who can swim well. But two members of our party never got in the water and they had a memorable experience in the fort area as well.Highly recommend the sea plane experience if you can swing it. By flying over you are able to see some other great sites including: the island of Key West, and a few other islands along the way, two sunken ships, many sea turtles as you fly over these protected waters and the occasional shark and dolphin. Additionally, you land and take off from the water, how cool is that!? Expensive: Must pay for the ride over (only boat or plane) and an additional $5 entrance fee for the National Park.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We did the half day seaplane tour with our two young children and loved it!!! I would recommend taking earplugs for the kids in case they won't leave the headphones on though. The beach was beautiful and my kids loved playing in the sand. My husband and I really enjoyed the fort and views, but the fort wasn't child friendly. There were a lot of drop offs, etc. Luckily my parents went and we took turns exploring the fort while the kids played on the beach. The only thing I wish we had done differently was take the full day tour. We were enjoying the beach so much we hated to leave, and I didn't get a chance to do much snorkeling.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is quite an historical fort. We also wanted to swim and snorkel, but there was a lot of wind and the water was too murky to see anything. There were two boats that Cubans had escaped to the island in, and it helped me realize the Cubans had really risked their lives to come to the Great United States of America. Just before we got to the island, there was a signup available for guided tours. It sounded like there were only two times available, and only 25 people per tour -- but we had well over 100 on the ferry. It turns out they open up more times as the two initial times get filled up, but they didn't bother to tell us that -- bummer!","December 14, 2014",Great for History buffs,2,"Fort Wayne, Indiana",4

They tried to tell everyone to take Dramamine before they left the dock but not everyone did. There were people throwing up everywhere. Breakfast and lunch was very good. Continental type stuff for breakfast-yogurt, bagels, fruit, etc. Lunch was make your own sandwiches. Only bathrooms are on the boat.","December 14, 2014",Too bad it was so cold,65,Brunswick,4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"of all of the us national parks, this is probably the one i anticipated visiting the most, yet the one i thought i'd be least likely to see, as it is way out in the gulf of mexico, and getting to the park certainly is not cheap. my sister and i opted for the national park ferry to the park (the yankee freedom III- see separate review), which set us back over $300 for the two of us. once you get past the expense of getting to the park, however, the admission fee is minimal, and the fee for camping on one of several available sites is nominal. without spending the night at the park, typically one only has a few hours with which to explore garden key, the island on which fort jefferson is located. this is not enough. there are both guided and self-guided tours of fort jefferson that can be taken. the snorkeling, especially along the old coaling dock ruins and moat wall, is fabulous on a good day, and you're still certain to spy at least a fish or two and some coral and sponges on a less than ideal day. birdwatchers will also have plenty to hold there interest, as there are a wide variety of avian life enjoying the area by land, air, and sea, as well. the dry tortugas got their name because there is no fresh water on the islands. everything must be brought in, including your food. that said, i believe the ferry comes to the island daily, and they have food and beverages available for purchase. (this info will come in handy when i get around to visiting the island again, this time to spend the night and, therefore, buy myself some more time to explore all the island has to offer.)","December 14, 2014",this may be my new favorite national park,62,"columbia, sc",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"With Fort Jefferson/Dry Tortugas being about 70 miles from Key West, you can only get there by seaplane or ferry. Neither are cheap, but we splurged for the seaplane. It takes about 40 minutes to get there, flying low the entire trip and seeing different little islands, shipwrecks and some marine life. Landing in the water (and later taking off from the water) was a great thrill. The fort is very cool, although at over 160 years old, it shows its age. We walked around the fort, climbed to the top for some great pictures and did some snorkeling. The sand is very nice, there's lots of sun (take sunscreen, you can't buy any once you're there) and some marine life. We found more marine life snorkeling around the pylons, including a jellyfish. Not knowing if there were more of those around, we retreated from the pylons and went back and relaxed at the beach.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wow - that's all I can say! I really didn't know what to expect, but Dry Tortugas National Park is so unique and beautiful that I was actually speechless at first! We took the ferry to DRTO, which was a nice, smooth ride. We did use Dramamine as suggested. Sunscreen is absolutely necessary, as well as swimming gear, hats, and sunglasses. If you are not exploring the stunning, Civil War era fort, it is incredibly bright and very hot. Make sure you bring plenty of water and stay hydrated. If you go during the summer, be prepared for lots of heat, and dress accordingly. I highly recommend trying to visit during fall or winter, when the weather is cooler and less severe.There are two options when you visit DRTO:1. Explore the Fort - it's a very cool fort, and the ferry personnel put on a great, historically minded tour. You can go through the fort and on top of it, and the top is the best part. You'll see arresting views of the turquoise water and pristine beaches.2. Explore the Beach - This was my favorite part. The water is so clear that you can see every fish and piece of coral, and the breeze is refreshing. It's very, very hot though. Be sure to re-apply sunscreen often.We snorkeled around, and even though the current was pretty strong we had a great time! The fish are incredibly large and vibrant in color, and the coral is beautiful. There was a lot of jellyfish, though, so we had to be careful not to get stung. Don't let that scare you from snorkeling - it's the best part of visiting this Park! If you take the ferry to DRTO, you can use your own snorkeling gear (recommended) or rent theirs. Snorkels, masks, and flippers are all provided.I think my favorite thing about Dry Tortugas National Park is that it represents the incredible diversity of America's National Parks. It's beautiful, pristine, and absolutely memorable. I would go again and again! :)","December 7, 2014",Absolutely worth visiting!,43,Colorado,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a fantastic trip. All the glowing reviews are correct. I knew we would love it, but I debated long and hard about taking the boat or the plane to get there. We went the first week in November when the powerboat races were at Key West, and the tour boat to Fort Jefferson was not running during that time. So the decision was taken from us. The plane ride was fantastic and one of the highlights of the whole experience, so we're not complaining but...Lesson #1 If you plan to take the boat, make sure it's running during your visit. The plane, while amazing, is more expensive, and you might be disappointed if the boat is unavailable.We loved the history of the fort, its immense size, the actual boats used by Cuban refugees that are housed on the ground floor of the fort, and Dr. Mudd's cell (he treated John Wilkes Booth's injury after the assassination) but...Lesson #2 There were no guides or rangers available to add meaning to the experience of wandering an enormous fort. There are no maps, brochures or signs which give overviews or highlights. We found a ranger who was working on a construction project, and he helped us find the cell of the Lincoln conspirators, but that was luck. The fort is still well worth visiting despite these drawbacks. The view from the top of the walls alone is breathtaking.The beach is amazing...almost deserted when only the planes are there (40 people only!) and it is natural coral sand, unlike the man-made beaches of Key West. We northerners found the water temperature fine for us. Snorkeling along the wall of the fort is really a cool experience but3. The water is not as clear as I thought it would be and the fish were not as prolific as some places we've snorkeled. Still worth it, though...for the setting alone and the numerous conchs growing near the wall.Definitely go! It's unique and well worth the 70 mile trip.","December 2, 2014",Specific to Visiting in November,33,"Manchester, New Hampshire",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We flew to the island by seaplane but because of bad weather predicted later, we decided to take the ferry back. Frankly, the ferry ride -- 70 miles -- got a little boring; luckily I had bought a great history of the railroad built along the Keys and had lots to think about.The island itself is a stopping point for many birds during the spring migration and we saw many different birds, perhaps 15 species altogether. Snorkeling was very tough because of rough seas but said to be splendid in good weather. Nesting birds restricted our movements, but the birds seeking water around the fort itself made up for that problem.A small but select gift shop, a very interesting exhibit of the history of the place, thoughtful and helpful guides, great resting spots -- all made for a fascinating day.Take food and water -- there's not much food or drink available in the shop.BTW: This is an island with two names.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My man and I have been to Key West twice together and both times we went to DT. The first time we took the ferry which was interesting. The seas were rough (8-9' chop) and the boat moved so much it caused at least half the folks to get sea-sick. You get a wonderful breakfast but most lost that. They served a lunch which we missed as we were in the fort walking around. On the way back, they gave us some Dramamine which helped greatly as the seas were still as choppy! Great service though I have to say. The island itself is an interesting spot to photograph as there are so many birds, shells, views. Fort Jefferson is almost fully accessible though one must be aware there are no railings up top and it can get quite windy so watch smaller people! The ground is also uneven and the stairs could be difficult for some. This year (November 2014) we packed a whole suitcase dedicated to camping overnight here but unfortunately we were unable to as the Yankee Freedom was not running that week and we could only get there by sea-plane and they can't accommodate campers.

As a day trip, i would have been disappointed. Is a long time on a boat for only about 4 hours on land (more time in transit than at the destination). The island itself is nice, clean. The park reamers are knowledgeable and helpful as well. Fort Jefferson is nice to see, and takes done time to walk through, but not terribly long. The are some great scenic sights and photos to be had from the rooftop. But i would have felt rushed of i was there on the day trip. After the crowds leave, it's just you and the campers.

Also, reservations are recommended for kayaks and camping. You get to see the sunrise and sunset when you camp. It's amazing. If you choose to camp, so diligent research.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I had heard about this Fort some 70 miles West of Key West. Spent the next 10 month planning my Florida trip and studying the area that touches the Gulf of Mexico.First thing I did do is make sure to find a hotel in Key West to stay at before and after I get back from Fort Jefferson, using Trip Advisor I found the Pegasus Hotel of Duval, very nice place and they have PARKING!Staying in Key West is the way of getting to the Yankee Freedom dock on time or earlier.The ride out there had the swap out for two weeks, National Park Ranger, he informed us of the islands off Key West, what they were used for and about the Atocha which is still being worked to this day.First sight of the Fort makes it stick out as there is not any structure other than lighthouses in the area.You follow the channel around to the North side of the Fort till you curl into the dock area.Short speech of what you can do ad times to eat lunch on the boat and time to leave back for Key West.You can walk to most areas of the Fort, 16 Million bricks it took! Both mid and upper parts are accessible, the canons on top are newly restored.Make sure to take time to grab snorkeling gear, unless you brought your own and enjoy the reefs and fish, follow the seawall around, they have many fish, colorful ones abound close in!Going back in Oct 2015 to camp there!","November 16, 2014","Awesome trip back in time, Fort Jefferson!",30,taoal,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was an average attraction, the boat ride was very long, 2-1/2 hours each way. There was nothing to see along the way, just water, I thought maybe we'd see some dolphins, fish, birds, something. Once we arrived, we did the self-tour of the Fort, which was a good idea, since the guided tour that is advertised was going to last an hour and you don't need that much time to see everything. They only had room for 50 (2 groups of 25) on the guided tours anyway, so it was just as well we didn't rush to the galley and sign up for that. The snorkeling was OK, there were a lot of jellyfish that day, not the vendor's fault, but it kind of put a damper on it for us. However, the water was clear, we did see some fish and had a nice time in the water and on dry land for a couple hours before the boat ride home. The food was good, continental breakfast and sandwiches (make your own) for lunch. The crew was helpful and nice. Once was enough for this one, I wouldn't do it again, mostly because of the long time on the boat.","November 14, 2014","Long boat ride, average snorkeling and historic site",18,"Oldsmar, Florida",3

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The trip looks expensive at first glance. When you realize that the price includes the round-trip boat ride, guided information during the cruise, a breakfast buffet and lunch, admission to the National Park and everything you need for snorkeling at the site, that price is really quite reasonable. History buffs will relish the fort and the guided tours there. Nature lovers will love the top grade snorkeling opportunities and the full use of needed gear provided at no extra cost, refreshments and conveniences at no extra charge. This is basically a mini all-inclusive opportunity to learn about this very unique place and to use leisure time to explore nature and have a lot of fun. The food, while simple, is good and has something for every dietary preference. The crew is very friendly and extremely helpful. We had known about the existence of this National Park and planned for the visit early on, but we really had no idea just how much fun the day would become.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the ferry in late October, camped and explored the Island over several days. If you take the ferry, they have a short video that tells about the fort, well worth watching (if you aren’t sea sick) made our self tour much more enjoyable. There are small information signs if you choose to do the self tour. Fort has three levels, brick work is impressive on the mail levels but try to make it to the top, we thought the view and the gun mounts were worth it. (you have to take the spiral stair ways to get to the top, they don’t tell you that until after you have walked a long way on the self tour, if you want to get to the top fast bypass the full walking tour and head for the Harbor Light to the right of the gift store, it takes you to the top) The quiet empty fort makes a nice place to explore, take pictures and think about how different things were then. The structure is impressive and one can get fabulous shots of doorways and arches. Attached to the small gift shop is an interactive area with a short 3D video and journals from when the fort was operational. If you have a chance read a few, some are very comical. South beach, is small but ALL WHITE SAND AND NO SEAWEED, (a commodity we found hard to come by elsewhere in the Keys) We were glad we wore water shoes, coral everywhere. Snorkeling is very good (my husband said) I was satisfied to walk the Moat Wall and look at the fish from above, you can see them well. An added treat in October Bush Key is open, (October 15 to January 15) the North side is full of coral and shells, the most impressive collection I’ve ever seen! (you are not aloud to take anything from a NP, maybe thats why there are so many) The vegetation is impressive, cactus all over. The South side of Bush Key is white sand only, absolutely no shells, amazing, makes for a nice walk, the north side would be difficult for older people or someone wearing no shoes. With so much to do it seems a one day visit, (4 1/2 hours with the ferry, 6 1/2 with plane) might be a rush. If you eliminate Bush Key from the equation, I would definitely walk the Moat Wall 6/10 mile, climb to the top of the fort at the Harbor Light, visit South beach and try a little snorkeling if the waters nice. One more thing, there are hermit crabs EVERYWHERE, don’t be surprised if you notice the ground moving. ","November 11, 2014",Nice destination and full day of activity,82,"Greenfield,IN",5

Dry Tortugas National Park, Ft. Jefferson is a step back in time. You can do a self guided tour or join one guided by the Park Rangers. We choose to do the self guided tour. The fort is massive and it takes awhile to completely see it all. I suggest climbing to the top and walking around the perimeter first. There are picnic tables and a few treed area otherwise it is open to the sun. Bring whatever you want to eat or drink. Camping is allowed through reservations. We only did a day trip. The water surrounding the fort is clear swimming and snorkeling is allowed in certain areas. The day we visited there were jelly fish in the swimming area and they do sting.

I spent the extra money (not that much more) to take the sea plane instead of the boat. Well worth the money! Plane ride is only 35 minutes each way and you see the reef, islands and lots of scenes you wouldn't see from a boat. Highly recommend snorkeling there!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Loaded up the kayak and the camping gear on the Yankee Freedom and headed out for 3 days at Ft. Jefferson with my niece. My second time camping here and just as great as the first. It's primitive camping with no water and no electric so come prepared, but it's the true meaning of sleeping under the stars. And when all the day tourists leave, the limited amount of campers have the place all to themselves, free to explore the fort and its inner grounds until sunset. And at sunset everyone goes to sit on the beach or the moat wall and watch the sunset and hope to see the green flash. We loved walking the moat at night and for a morning stroll. We even saw the resident crocodile sunning himself! Snorkeling the moat wall and the old pilings are a must do. And although you a amongst strangers, the campers feel like a family unit. Most leave extra water and charcoal for the next group coming in. This was March and the winds were blowing at a steady 30mph with even stronger gusts. It was a bit of a struggle setting up camp and lighting our charcoal (make sure to bring fire starter bricks). We were lucky enough to have a Hobie mirage drive kayak. The pedal drive system allowed us to go conquer the white caps and high seas and we were able to circumnavigate around the island. We had planned to kayak out to Loggerhead Key 3 miles west, but after about a mile and a half the winds got the better of us. It was the headwinds coming back that tested your stamina! Well, that and the waves crashing over the bow. We got soaked but had a blast!The winds never died down but that didn't matter. The serenity of this place is just magical. The skies were clear and the stars so plentiful. It was mesmerizing. It is an experience like no other. A must do for everyone.","October 26, 2014",Camping in Paradise,19,"Tampa, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,We took a high-speed Catamaran over to the Dry Tortuga's for a day trip. Lunch was included in the cost and it was absolutely fascinating. Very fortunate because we had excellent weather and the seas will calm and smooth with flying fish following us on the journey. Once you get to the fort you can walk around and look at the cannons and the battlements and really think what a horribly hot and miserable place it must've been for the poor soldiers that were based here many years ago in their uniforms! The history of Dr. Mudd who treated John Wilkes Booth and was imprisoned on the island is fascinating too. Of course if you're just coming for the day as a tourist it's the most wonderful place to go snorkeling and the fish around the sea walls and docks is all absolutely incredible. Highly recommended and lunch was tasty too. ,"October 25, 2014",Must see!,665,"Miami, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I highly recommend taking the seaplane to Dry Tortugas. When I took it the view during the flight was amazing! We were able to see sharks and sea turtles in the ocean, along with sunken ships. The pilot and a recording gives a little history of what you are flying over, but doesn't go overboard! When we arrived at Dry Tortugas we had about 2 1/2 hours to snorkel and explore. We spent about an hour snorkeling and were able to see quite a few beautiful fish and coral. You do have to be cautious though, because there are Jelly Fish. No one in our group came in contact with a jelly fish, but I am sure if you aren't aware and careful it can easily happen. We spend the other hour and a half walking around the outside of the fort and looking at all the fish. The water is so clear there. We also enjoyed talking to the campers. Overall I thought it was an amazing experience and I plan to do it again, but I will fly in again.

On the island you get chance to explore Fort Jefferson on your own or you can attend one of the free guided tours. After that there's the opportunity to relax on one of the beaches or have a go at snorkeling using the equipment they provide. You only get about 4.5 hours on the island and longer would certainly be better. There is the option to camp there overnight which I certainly wish I'd considered before going! You'll get breakfast provided on the journey out and lunch provided on the island. They also open the bar on board for the return journey if you fancy a drink or two!

The ferry includes breakfast and lunch and snorkel gear. The island was just so beautiful beyond words, the water so blue and restful. I would certainly recommend this adventure for all. This is not inexpensive but a lovely full day event.","October 17, 2014","great day trip, a must do attraction while staying at Key West",64,"Denver, Colorado",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,Yankee Freedom boat ride was pretty fun. The fort is very cool and snorkeling was awesome. The water color reminded me of the Virgin Islands. The snorkel trip was one of the best I have been on. There were alot of fish and I have never seen such a wide variety while snorkeling. My family and I wish we had considered the camping option. We will be going back and will be camping next time. There just isn't enough time in one day to see as much as you would like to. ,"October 17, 2014",This was Fantastic,6,"New Palestine, Indiana",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Dry Tortugas National Park is a definitely must see while visiting Key West. The ticket prices are a little expensive ($170/person) however, it was worth every penny. There is a two-hour ferry ride there and back (which was a bit unpleasant at times due to the rough waters), however, staff was very accommodating. With your ticket, you are served breakfast (cereals, cold cuts, eggs, bagels, etc.) and lunch (sandwiches, hummus, fruits, chips, cookies,etc.) When getting off the boat, take a guided tour of the fort and make sure you climb all the way to the top - lots of great views from there and many wonderful picture opportunities. Grab some snorkeling gear and go towards the south beach area to snorkel and layout. Once it's time to return home, there are four fresh water showers located in the back of the boat. Rinse off and take a nap during the ride home. ","October 16, 2014",A must see while in Key West,2,,5

The folks at Key West Seaplane Adventures made this a GREAT trip. They run it like clock-work, but we never felt stressed or rushed. We were on the first trip of the day, and had plenty of time to walk the grounds and the fort. You can walk the third/top-level most of the way around and the views are simply gorgeous.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I took the ferry out to the island after much thought of whether I wanted to spend so much time on a boat ride while on vacation. In the end decided I had to try it since it was the #1 thing to do in Key West. Sure am glad I did! The ferry leaves early, but they served a nice continental breakfast. The ride there was relaxing, especially if you needed a nap and seemed to go by fast. When you get there, you can do whatever you'd like on the small island. They provide snorkel equipment to snorkel off the beach, and have a guided tour of the fort. If you're looking to have a 'homebase' for your group for the day outside, I recommend you be one of the first people off the boat to grab a picnic table in the shade. It was HOT outside and shade is limited on the island outside of the fort. The water was a perfect temp and after attempting to snorkel in a couple of different areas I gave up due to the large amount of jellyfish in the water. You are able to come and go from the ferry throughout the day, and they serve lunch shortly after you arrive. The sandwiches were very good and since it's a buffet, I grabbed a few extra sodas, chips and cookies for later the afternoon. After lunch, all food and drink (except water) costs additional money. The views from the fort were gorgeous! There is no running water or electricity on the island, but like I said, the ferry and it's clean restrooms are always available, in addition to a hose with fresh water off the dock. I am so glad I did this tour and even wouldn't hesitate to do it again in the future! ","October 14, 2014",A Must See!,76,"Wausau, Wisconsin",5

But, the views were breathtaking both from sea level and on top of the fort! I would do this trip again, or go by plane. Don't expect the people on board to go out of there way and smile. We kind if felt like we were in there way when we got there and just wanted to relax for 15 min prior to lunch. The captain was great, I wish the other staff had same attitude.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"First, I do not enjoy camping. Though I've done it in the past, we stopped cause it's too much work. We made an exception for this place cause it's such a special experience. We've done the day trip before, but to get to spend the night on the fort was amazing. So much quieter and relaxing after the ferry and planes leave for the day and you get the place to yourself. You get to enjoy the sunrises and sunsets, which are unlike anywhere else. And you get the beach to yourself. Here's a few tips I learned: -we were concerned about bringing too much stuff cause of the weight, but the crew of the Yankee freedom didn't seem to mind (I'm sure within reason) -we were told there would be no mosquitoes, so we were not prepared for the wrath of those pesky creatures! My group all left with numerous bites. Even though we were told it's very rare, bring bug spray just in case. That was the worse part of the trip-we went in October and it was still quite humid and hot. We didn't bring a lot of extra clothes due to space, but we got so hot and sweaty that we went through clothes quicker than we thought and wish we had more to change in to-we brought a 5 gallon container of water and about 12 water bottles in the cooler cause we didn't want to run out. We brought way too much. When the ice in the cooler melted we just refilled the 5 gal container with it, so we were fine. The boat sells ice for $7/bag, and we had to buy 2 bags the second day, and that got us through no problems. I also recommend eating lunch on the boat the last day you are there so you don't have to worry about it that day. Plus the air feels great. If you just don't feel like packing a lot of food, you can also buy lunch on the boat everyday you're there. I don't know exactly how much that is, but might be worth it so you can pack light. Overall it was a great trip (minus mosquitoes). Jellyfish weren't an issue for us. We didn't have any Cubans land even though conditions were favorable both nights. There are definitely rats there, we saw lots of them, but since we didn't leave any food in the tents they didn't bother us. Also, hermit crabs are EVERYWHERE. The toilets weren't bad. I was told the men's was worse than the women's, but can't vouch for that. I was glad I brought an extra roll of TP cause one stall was out. I would like to go again soon, but I'll go when it's less humid and the mosquitoes have vacated the area :)","October 10, 2014",Two nights of camping,25,"Orlando, Florida",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Very unique ""must visit"" national park. Gorgeious water and views unlike any other. Fascinating history and worth a tour. Water was a little choppy on the day we were there which made the snorkeling slightly challenging but worth it. Saw an amazing amount of fish near the north beach pilings, and huge coral in many variations. Due to the chop on the water, it was a little ""silty"" and not crystal clear like we have seen in pictures but no mistaking the hundreds of fish swimming around us. There had been lots of jellyfish in the area for the week prior, and we saw some along the moat but none in the area where we swam. The Yankee Freedom was a beautiful clean boat with a great crew who were friendly and informative. Food was standard fare for breakfast and lunch but satisfactory.","October 8, 2014",Beautiful national park!,44,"Kennebunk, Maine",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"As a surprise, my husband booked the sea plane out to Dry Tortugas, where we arrived about 2 hours before the first ferry of the day. We had plenty of time to explore Ft. Jefferson with no one around. It was amazing to be able to climb to the top of the fort, and over look the moat - with NO RAILINGS to stop you from getting ""too close"" to the edge. We were eating our lunch (you must carry in/out all food & water) when the first ferry finally arrived. We took time to snorkel around the outside of the moat - which has basically become a reef. Saw a 3 foot midnight blue parrot fish along with many of his fantastic fish friends! We were so impressed... until we headed to the pilings of the old coaling docks! The fish among the coaling docks ruins are abundant, and you can often see schools of amazing fish there. Caution: snorkeling among the pilings is not for the novice. Coral formations can be sharp, the area is tight due to triangular steel beams, and often the current is strong. That being said, Dry Tortugas is well worth a day of your vacation!!

We had lunch then did some snorkeling until it was time to leave. Some of the things we were able to see were sea urchins, sea biscuits, brain coral, sea fans and beautiful fish.

The island is beautiful with the turquoise waters, Fort Jefferson, the lighthouse, snorkeling, the history, it's all good. Almost being off the grid for a day is a refreshing and peaceful experience. The wildlife of birds and fish were fun to experience as well. I did see a I did see a male Magnificent Frigatebird flying overhead. We went in early October and it was very hot but just go in for a snorkel and all is fine. Some complained about the food on the catamaran but it's not about the food, people. It's all about the park. This is not really a place for young children as there is not much for them to do and it is a long day. They do have the junior ranger program but I don't think I'd bring a child under 10 there. For adults, this is a special gem in the national park system. It was the highlight of our trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the seaplane adventure out to Fort Jefferson and it was one of the greatest trips of our lives. If you take the first plane out in the morning, you'll get there before any of the ferry passengers. Essentially it's you and the other folks from the seaplane. There are only 10 or 12 folks allowed on the plane, so a VERY small group. The Visitors' Center might not open exactly on time, but it's such a great park to check out that you won't mind. Flying over the Marquesas and seeing the wrecks of cuban emigrees' boats is fascinating. Weather is the one thing can affect your trip. We had it booked for 2012, but because of a storm couldn't go out. The water would've been too rough for the seaplane.

The water was too rough to snorkel and couldn't see anything anyway. But it was a good day spent to a place we didn't know much about so we would recommend the trip and tour. Bring your own water and a snack. ","October 5, 2014",Great tour of the fort,17,"Fort Walton Beach, Florida",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Excellent experience! We walked around the various levels of the fort and did a little swimming…. The latter, however, was impaired by the overabundance of Jelly Fish around the island, but well worth the time spent in the water. Others were swimming and snorkeling freely without regard for the Jelly Fish so it was just our own preference. Whether you snorkel, swim or just choose to walk Fort Jefferson, where you can read excerpts of diaries from the prisoners including Dr. Mudd, the experience is well worth it. The plane ride back and forth gives you unparalleled aerial views of Key West and marine life, including huge sea turtles and the ride is smoother than many flights I've been on in 737s, including landing. Silky smooth…. Strongly recommend it!","October 5, 2014",Seaplane Adventures well worth the expense,6,Missouri,5

We saw a sea turtle on the way out and the ride was not very rough for us that day. The breakfast and lunch they provided were nothing special, hard boiled eggs, bagels, cereal - cold cuts, chips, cookies. You could buy mixed drinks and beer on the way back.But me and my group were really looking forward to snorkeling as well as seeing the Fort. I kid you not, there were thousands of pink jellyfish all around the island with nowhere to snorkel safely. You couldn't go into the water past your waist without being stung by floating jellyfish tentacles that had broken off from the jellyfish. And if you tried to avoid the actual jellyfish those unseeable floating tentacles still stung you. So this was a huge disappointment for me and my group. All of us that snorkeled that day got stung as well as everyone else in the water who also tried to swim out to the reefs. And yes, it hurts and leaves red welts on you for the rest of the day.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped on Dry Tortugas in May 2014 for the max amount of time (3 nights) and had an incredible time! Some suggestions/tips for folks planning to camp:-Bring a portable shower! We thought we would be okay with just cleaning off in the ocean, but the salt water does NOT make you feel clean :) after day 2 we felt filthy and really wanted a shower. You can rinse off on the Yankee Freedom, but you can't use soap or shampoo, so you don't actually get clean.-Bring tons of water (to drink and to shower with). We brought 2 of those water cooler sized jugs and a pump to pump the water out. If you have extra at the end, give it to your neighbours!-If you are in a group of 2 or more, have someone run ahead and pick a good campsite after the chat with the ranger. The other person/people can bring all the bags. We read this tip on TA, and are glad we listened! We got the best site on the island, that had just cleared out minutes earlier.-Bring a good camera! This place is so incredibly beautiful. We saw sharks, birds, the crocodile in the moat, hundreds of crabs, and more! There are some beautiful sunsets here, so make sure to capture some of those from the moat or the top of the fort.-If you have room, bring a dining tent. It was a nice place to cook, eat, relax and play cards and have some drinks at the end of the day. All of our neighbours were stuck in their tents after dark, but we were able to stay up in our dining tent and have some fun for a couple extra hours.-Bring some cash to have lunch on the Yankee Freedom. You get sick of canned food after a while, and its nice to have a fresh meal on the air-conditioned boat. For $7/each there were drinks, sandwiches, chips, cookies and potato salad. I am a vegetarian and would make a veggie sandwich everyday, which was amazing! You can also buy ice on the boat. Perfect for making drinks. I think it was $7/bag, but totally worth it.We had an absolutely incredible time, and we can't wait to go back! Highly recommend this trip to everyone! Well worth the money.

All in all it was a superb day out although at the height of the season when the ship is full there must be queues etc so you might want to pay more for the seaplane ( which looked fun anyway ).The tour round Fort Jefferson by Ryan from the ship was interesting and not over - long or exhausting given the heat ( over 90F ) and you have ample time to then explore on your own , but watch your footing as there are some unsafe areas and not many guard rails. We didn't snorkel but if you want to the ship has everything you will need , you do have time and the water was crystal clear and marine life extraordinary.The real highlight for us was the eco - tour conducted by the Interpretative Park Ranger, Micheal, who was very well informed and happy with a small group ( we were just two ) to extend the tour to the less visited parts of the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If there is a word to describe the day we spent it would be awesome! It is a early morning start with the boat tour but it is so well worth it. The boat is nice, the crew super friendly and the food they feed you for breakfast and lunch good. It is an island and a treasure so people who come need to be aware and respectful to the environment and the surrounding. It is not a cruise trip and as the boat goes across the open ocean it can be a rough ride depending on weather. So don't expect a princess treatment with amenities, it is a National Park!The fort is super interesting and there are nice beaches with snorkeling. You have to get out to the reef though to really see. It is great for beginners to stay in the shallow waters around the fort and explore. We saw some fish and a small reef shark which was a great excitement. When we went there were jelly fish which usually there aren't but hello climate change and environmental pollution - the water is warmer and algae is growing which to my knowledge causes for higher jelly fish population.People visiting - please do me a favor and take your trash into the bins and don't leave it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The trip out there is a bit tedious, and the food supplied is basic to say the least, but once at the Fort it os quite wonderful. I did not take the organized tour, not my kind of thing. But exploring on your own is really awesome. I imagine kids would love it. Lots of weird, corridors and castle-like walls to explore. Great place for photo ops, swimming and picnics. ","September 23, 2014",Very beautiful,3,"Padstow, United Kingdom",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"After extensive research and preparation, my husband and I finally made it to Dry Tortugas for a 3 night, 4 day camping trip by way of the Yankee Freedom. The Yankee Freedom is a great ship: very clean, comfortable, and a great crew. Brought our kayaks down from Savannah, GA. We had an amazing time snorkeling, circumnavigating Garden Key in our kayaks, fishing, relaxing on the south beach, watching the sunsets, strolling the moat, exploring the fort, and stargazing. We also located the coral heads off Garden Key. The highlight of our trip was our paddle to Loggerhead Key with Mike and Olga. It was exhausting but well worth the effort. If you have access to a kayak, don't miss Little Africa. Thanks to Ranger Adam for the great fishing tips and keeping us safe. We did not see Carlos the crocodile but twenty nine Cubans landed on Garden Key while we were there. Got great pictures of them and the Coast Guard Cutter that came to take them to Miami. Our only regret was not enough time at DTNP. Tip: If you are camping, plan this trip very carefully. Make sure you have match light and a sterno stove. We cooked chili and chicken curry and froze it for the trip and grilled asparagus and garlic toast. Our best meal was the grilled mutton snapper we caught. Lunches can be bought from the Yankee Freedom for $7, as well as ice for $7 a bag and water for $2 a bottle. We ate yogurt and fig bars for breakfast every morning and made great coffee with our sterno stove and French press. We brought a 7 gallon water container for cooking, washing, and doing dishes plus about a case of bottled water (some frozen), ginger ale, and coconut water. We had ample water. Bring tin foil, baby wipes and camp mats. You will need a VHF radio if you plan to kayak to Loggerhead Key. Bring your favorite libation - it makes for a great, relaxing evening.","September 23, 2014",Camping Trip of a Lifetime,13,"Savannah, Georgia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,I loved the trip out there. It kind of long but worth it. The fort is really cool to explore but my favorite was the snorkeling.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We flew in a sea plane from Key West to Dr Tortugas for a day of snorkeling. The plane ride was 45 min as opposed to a 2-2 1/2 hr boat ride. It was amazing. There is a huge fortress on the island that you can explore in addition to some of the best snorkeling in the Key West area. We saw lots of fish, sea turtles, & jelly fish.

After arriving, we did the self-guided tour and really enjoyed the fort. Then, after lunch, we spent the afternoon snorkeling. It was very enjoyable. The ferry food was nothing special - breakfast was all cold with limited options, but lunch was better, with various breads, chicken salad, meats and cheeses. Even with the jelly fish - typical for this time of year - the snorkeling was intersting and the equipment provided was excellent.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I've been vacationing in Key West for 10 years, and just recently made the trip to the Dry Tortugas, and I'm honestly sorry I waited this long to go out to this National Park. We booked through this keywestvacation.com and they made it easy for us to decide on taking the ferry out to the island (they have a plane option as well). I feel that we were really lucky, because it was cloudy the whole ride out, but the sun gods must've came out to play. It ended up being gorgeous out and we saw the most amazing wildlife while snorkeling the coral reef! I also consider myself a history buff, so the tour around Fort Jefferson was fun for me (probably not so entertaining for kids). We heard there is a camping option too, but the rangers said it gets books sometimes a year in advance. Here's the page we booked from: http://www.keywestvacation.com/key-west-dry-tortugas/","September 16, 2014",Excellent Getaway from Our Getaway,17,"Stuart, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Went snorkeling on the island. The snorkeling was great. Many, many spots to explore. Not too crowded. The boat ride out was alright, the food on the boat is what you'd expect. Overall, well worth it for any age group.","September 16, 2014",Snorkeling fun,5,Ohio,4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I'll start with some warnings and advice. First off, if you're considering going to Dry Tortugas, don't think about it any further and just go! I highly recommend it and it was the unanimous highlight for our trip throughout Miami and the Keys.Now, about our boat ride with Yankee Freedom, note the weather varies depending on when you go. Some people experience a smooth ride, but for our ride in late May, it was a rough, rollercoaster ride. Imagine being on a wooden roller coaster over and over for about an hour and you can see what this can do to people. On the day that we went, I kid you not, the ship turned back 10-15 minutes into the ride and headed back to the dock. Then, we proceeded to watch as a big man was carried out of the top cabin. I say this not to scare you into not going, but rather warn you of what's possible. Take dramamine 45 minutes BEFORE you get on the boat if you have any doubts about how the weather conditions may be or question how you'll be on the boat. You'd much rather be slightly drowsy than be miserable once you arrive on the island. They also sell dramamine on the boat, but if you take it then, it's too late. Out of 4 people in our group, I usually do the best in boat rides, but on the return trip, even I was slumped in my seat and doing my best to hold it together. Once you get to the island, you'll have about 5 hours. This may sound like a long time, but once you’re on the island, you’ll wish you had 1-2 hours more.You can join a guided tour for an hour or explore the island on your own. If you choose to go with the guided tour, note that the ship carries 150 passengers, so they split the guided tours into two groups. Be sure to sign up for the tour with the person that has been making the introductions and announcements during the boat ride. This will usually be the more outgoing and enthusiastic guide. There are two sign-ups sheets, so choose carefully. I was under the assumption that all staff members would be cheery and enthusiastic so we signed up with the smaller group thinking it will be more personal and we'll be able learn more. We couldn’t have be more wrong as the main tour group walked off filled with energy while we were left with someone who seemed like they have done the tour one too many times. We didn’t want to be rude, so after about 15 minutes we wandered off while the guide wasn’t looking.The fort is bigger than you think, so leave time to climb the stairs and get to the high vantage points. It is a breath taking view and if you time it just right, you may be able to watch the seaplanes take off in the afternoon.We heard bird watching was good on the island, but we had no time for that as the snorkeling was absolutely fantastic. You will see giant, healthy coral in shallow places all around the fort. The key is to walk LEFT from the dock, go all the way down, and swim around the fort walls. Initially we swam out in the open looking for marine life and didn’t see as much as we saw near the walls. There are so many coral and fish that hang by the walls. At one point, we saw hundreds of fish swirling around like a long fish highway. It is one of the best snorkeling spots I've been to in the world and I don’t say that lightly. They don’t have lifeguards around though, so grab a life jacket. It isn’t a difficult swim and there should be plenty of people around.Keep in mind that restrooms are only on the boat and to return to the boat during 12:00 - 1:00 PM for lunch. Remember to grab some extra water/drinks to help you last the afternoon. It is very hot and water is free during lunch, but you’ll have to pay for it after the lunch period.Also, remember to bring an extra set of clothing if you plan to snorkel. Our swimming suits didn’t dry quickly enough despite the heat and our wet clothes certainly didn’t help in our return boat ride back.Despite what I said about the boat ride, our memories will always be on the gorgeous reefs and breathtaking views. Dry Tortugas is a must if you are in the keys. If you really can’t handle the boat, try the seaplane alternative.","September 15, 2014",The worst boat ride and the most fun you'll have in the Keys,20,"Arcadia, California",5

It is about a 2 1/2 hr trip, nice easy boat ride, but if you have any tendency for sea sickness, take your dramamine about 45 min before departure (that was their suggestion). There are videos they play about the Fort and Dry Tortugas, also snorkeling info that may be helpful for first timers. They served breakfast on board and after arrival it seemed most people toured the fort either on a guided tour or self-tour. Returned to the boat for the provided lunch of cold cuts, cheese, breads, fruit, chips, cookies. Again, adequate for lunch. Then off for snorkeling. It really was a nice day trip. We took our own cooler with drinks and some people brought beach chairs. Also it is nice to bring a change of clothes, so you are not sitting in your wet suits on the little over 2 hr ride back to Key West. Most everyone on the boat was asleep on the way back! We arrived back in Key West around 5:30. Also, if you are a NP Pass holder, bring it with you and when you check in at the ferry terminal, they will reimburse your park entrance fee. Ours got credited back to our credit card. Bring some cash if you are interested in making any purchases in the gift shop.

It was great to see Key West, the other keys and the Dry Tortugas National Park by plane and, cool to land and take off (return trip) by water. We had about 2 hours to tour the fort and snorkel in the water around the fort which was the right amount of time. We saw a variety of beautiful fish and probably would have seen more however, there were many jellyfish (probably because the water was so warm...the weather was HOT) - this was a bit of a distraction - we found ourselves looking out for jellyfish more than looking for fish because we didn't want to swim in to the jellyfish. Still a great half day trip and, we would snorkel there again - the jellyfish issue is probably hit or miss depending on the time of year.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I took the early ferry(have to be there by 7:30 am) to dry tortugas national park last week.

Then, was lucky enough to board the ferry because I was running late and reached there by 7:50 am. They provide you with free snorkeling equipment with ferry tickets which also includes complimentary lunch and breakfast. Snorkeling experience was total fun but could have been better if there were lifeguards around. Basically, they say snorkel at your risk, which doesn't sound right to me. I did see people camping in the area, if you love to camp, this might be great spot given it is far off and you are in a lonely island (glimpses of cast away). You can also take the sea plane which lands on the shores which is kind of cool when I think about it.","September 7, 2014","It was a bliss, liked it",4,"Jersey City, New Jersey",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The day trip to the Dry Tortugas is a long way to go, but well worth it. It takes 2 1/2 hours each way, but the boat is so comfortable and the staff are so accommodating that it's not a big deal. A lot of people have complained that the water is rough, though it wasn't the day we just went. They always recommend taking dramamine if you are prone to sea sickness. When you get on board in the morning, the first thing they do is serve breakfast and then you are off. Most of the way there is pretty shallow water so generally the water isn't usually that rough.Once at the island, you have about 4- 4 1/2 hours to do whatever you like. They have a tour of the fort that you can sign up for or you can just opt to do a self-guided tour. We opted out of the tour because we wanted to snorkel first. There are a lot of fish to see there. They even have a resident crocodile, though we were told to consider yourself very lucky if you see him. He doesn't bother anyone. They just tell you to give him his space. We, unfortunately, didn't get to see him, though we saw tons and tons of jellyfish, which kind of spooks everyone. They are moon jellyfish, which don't sting hard, but nevertheless, kind of freaky. Don't let that scare you out of snorkeling, though, because it was some of the best snorkeling that you will probably do.Lunch was set up and anytime between 11-1, you could go back to the boat and grab some food, then head back out. Around 2:30, everyone has to be back on board for the ride home.

Locals get the big break at 105.Check-in at the ferry terminal NLT 715 AM and receive a group briefing. Board and eat a quite acceptable continental breakfast and launch at 0800 for 2.5 hours with intermittent tour talk.Arrive and you have the options to take the Ft Jefferson tour for about 1 hour or the lighthouse tour. They are included in the price. Or you can start your snorkeling immediately. The Yankee Freedom crew will disperse the equipment as soon as possible after docking. There is a nice video on board about how to use your snorkeling equipment.Those that have been on the boat before race off as soon as possible to claim one of the very limited shade spots in the area. Go back to the boat and grab lunch and bring it back to their location. No worries as there are many tables and you can also eat on board and return to the beach for snorkeling. The ship can max out at 160 people and the island and snorkeling areas can easily handle that group. No doubt you will run into overnight campers and some folks who were on their private vessels. You can also get there by seaplane at nearly twice the price. It is cool to watch the sea planes land from the deck of the Yankee Freedom. Lunch was very good. Sodas and water are provided until 1 PM for lunch. Lunch is part of the expense. NOTE: grab extra water at lunch and go back out to your snorkeling as it will cost you money for water after 1 PM.The boat starts the journey back to Key West at 245 PM Alcohol is served at this point.The crew is efficient and friendly. Lots of safety briefings to make sure you are aware of the do's & dont's both on the boat and in the National Park.We took the Ft Jefferson tour.

Depending on the time of year DEC/JAN the sea can get very, very rough. We had 1-3 ft. swells which were easily handled by the boat.Bring beach towels, sun tan lotion, camera, sunglasses, hat and a change of clothes. After snorkeling you can change on the dock.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"When vacationing in Key West, try to plan a full day doing the Dry Tortugas park. It's a boat ride about 90 minutes to an island that has a historical fort that you can tour, very nice snorkeling, a bird reserve which is excellent for bird watchers, and a good look at the challenges of living there during the Civil War time period. Boat excursions include breakfast and lunch, and you can sign up for a walking tour if the fort or go it alone. It makes for a very enjoyable day for adults young and old, but may be a bit long and boring for children.","September 2, 2014",Day trip to Dry Tortugas,1,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,We took the sea plane which was an experience in itself. The staff was very accommodating and delightful to work with. The snorkeling on the island was really fun and we saw lots of different types of coral and fish. Were startled by the very large Tarpon but this was part of what made the experience memorable. The fort is interesting and has many great photo opportunities. Would personally recommend the full day trip as you will be crunched for time to do it all in the 1/2 day adventure.,"September 2, 2014",Dont miss the chance to do this,7,,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"An exciting, low level sea plane ride across the shallow seas from Key West to Dry Tortugas presented a chance to see sharks, sea turtles and other forms of aquatic life as we skimmed over turquoise and azure seas. Two circuits of the Fort to get our bearings then a quick landing and taxi up to a pristine, blindingly white sand beach. A plentiful supply of bottled water was to hand as the blazing sun quickly engendered a thirst. What to do first? I opted for an exploration of the massive remains of the fort, contemplating the lives of the soldiers and their prisoners in such extreme conditions, totally reliant on their supply boats for every need as the island is completely barren. Once over, on with the free snorkelling gear and into a living aquarium to become part of the undersea world. Fish of all colours quickly surrounded me a nudged for handouts of food in the bath warm waters. All too quickly it was time to climb back in our plane for the return journey Ito the flaming sunset over the Keys. A once in a lifetime experience not to be soon forgotten.","September 2, 2014",Dry Tortugas because there is no fresh water,101,Manchester,5

But on my second trip, touring Florida with my family, I almost could not wait for the day we had booked the daytrip to Dry Tortugas. And what an amazing trip it was! We took the Yankee Freedom from Key West, had breakfast on the ferry, and enjoyed the 2 hour ride mostly on deck. An such a fantastic wiev when Dry Tortugas and Fort Jefferson came into sight!We did the snorkling first and then toured Fort Jefferson.

Bathrooms, food, drinks, air conditioned, etc. I spent the entire ride on deck looking at sea life. Toured Fort Jefferson, which was really cool and had a lot of history. Best part was snorkeling around the island. Crystal clear water, a multitude of tropical fish, and lots of coral. Felt like swimming in a giant aquarium! Was a little pricey but all inclusive. Even meals. Well worth it for the trip of a lifetime!","August 31, 2014",My favorite National Park so far!,1344,"Tavares, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I have wanted to visit the Dry Tortugas National Park for many years, but each visit to Key West was too short to plan for the trip. This time we stayed in Key West for 5 nights and made our reservations for the flight about a week in advance of our trip. We arrived in the morning on the first flight and had the fort almost entirely to ourselves. We spent about an hour and a half walking through the fort and seeing the various buildings (ruins). There is not alot to see compared to other forts we have visited, but the remote location and the history of the fort were enough for us. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and were very glad we made the trip. You can also snorkle off the beach, but we decided we wanted to spend our time at the fort. We took the 1/2 day trip so our time was limited on the island, and that is why we focused on the fort. However, we were happy with the 1/2 day trip, as we left soon after the majority of the other visitors arrived.","August 30, 2014",Well worth visiting!,42,"Plantation, Florida",5

We spent a lot of our time there snorkeling which was beautiful and mesmerizing, especially by the dock ruins. When we heard the announcement for those who were camping to leave the ferry, we wished we had known about this before making plans for our trip!

Dry Tortugas National Park,This is a pretty amazing place - a brick civil war fort in the middle of the ocean... We took the short seaplane out to the fort and were one of only a dozen people on the entire little island - very private and peaceful. The fort is worth about 30 minutes of tour but the highlight is getting in the water to snorkel. Great coral and fish especially on the northern side of the fort. If it were a choice of a day on the water with one of the charters or a day at Dry Tortuga my vote is the charter (we loved Captain Victoria!),"August 22, 2014","OK to visit, glad we did a half day",12,"Moraga, California",3

I took tour with Ryan, I am no history buff but found what he said really interesting. I snorkel for the rest of the afternoon. Time goes by so quicklyWhat was interesting was the amount of people on the boat (150 or so) never any long lines, plenty of food, drinks and snacks to go around.The fish were beautiful and the view spectacular. It was a long day but worth it. We drove from Marathon so by the time we docked we ate dinner and went back to hotel. Girls were too tired to see key west.I am so glad I went.

Dry Tortugas National Park,I love the Dry Tortugas. We took the ferry out there but there is also a sea plane trip that will take you out there. Once out on the island there's the fort. There is a a guided tour that moved a little too slow for us so we broke away from the group and walked around on our own. You can pretty much go anywhere you want on your own and there are plaques that still give you the historical information. We really enjoyed that you could go all the way to the top and really check out the old canons. This is also one of the best places to snorkel in the keys. The ferry provided masks and snorkels and we spent hours in the water looking at everything. This is a gorgeous spot mostly untouched by human influence and a must if you're traveling in the keys.,"August 21, 2014",Piece of heaven,10,,5

Don't spend too much time walking around in the fort, it all looks the same. Go up on the top level and take pictures, listen to some of the tour and GO SNORKELING! It was the single coolest thing I have ever done and saw in my life. The water was warm, the coral was brightly colored, and there were many many different types of marine life to look at. I keep telling people that it looked just like a postcard or what you see on TV, absolutely stunning.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My family took the Yankee Freedom out to Dry Tortuga for a day of exploring and snorkeling. From the time we boarded the vessel until we arrived back at Key West the staff was helpful, informative, friendly, and provided every guest with a great experience. The one-way ride took approximately 2hours and 20 minutes, so make sure you bring games, cards or some other activity for your child/children. Guests could choose to sit in the indoor air conditioned section or outside on the top deck enjoying the views. The boat had an ample number of bathrooms that were clean and well equipped. Breakfast consisted of cold items such as cereals, bagels, fruit, and morning drinks. At lunch the staff served cold cut sandwiches, fruit, potato salad, and chips. Once the boat reached the island guests had the opportunity to grab snorkel gear or head off with a National Park guide on a tour of Fort Jefferson. On the north side of the island snorkeling was beautiful but the water was a little bit choppy. The water on the south side was a bit more calm and just as beautiful. Fort Jefferson is shrouded in history and beauty. Walking the three floors was an adventure which my family will never forget. Don't let the distance keep you from this trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The trip to Dry Tortugas via Yankee Freedom III ferry was a great way to spend the day. The check-in process was very smooth and well organized, a continental buffet breakfast was served on board, and a great deli buffet lunch also served shortly after you arrive at Dry Tortugas. I personally took a Dramamine (based on negative past boating experiences), but no one else in my party took it (including teens) and they did not get sea sick, despite us getting some very fun swells on the way there.We did a self guided tour of Fort Jefferson, grabbed lunch in the ferry, ate at one of the outdoor picnic tables, and then snorkeled. For those that prefer to eat inside the air conditioned boat, that was also an option. Lunch buffet had a good selection of breads, cold cuts, potato salad, lots of watermelon, sodas, bottled water, chips, cookies. Snorkeling was weak as far as the amount of fishes we saw (late July), but it was still very fun, especially around the mote where you found more fishes swimming around. We even had the opportunity to see a ray swim right under us!The ferry arrived back around 5:15 pm, we then walked down to the end of Duval street, making the most of our full day in Key West.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We have decided to spend a night in Dry Tortugas. Although the camp operates on a ""first come, first served"" basis and reservation is not needed, but the parks authorities require prior reservation on the ferry that runs between Key West and Garden Keys at Dry Tortugas. Number places in the campground is limited to 10, so we have made reservation four months in advance. Ferry ticket for the people staying on the island costs $190 or $170 for those who want to spend on it only a few hours. Although boat departs at 8am, it is important to be at the ferry terminal at 6:30am (7am latest!). Because of some problems we arrived to the terminal at 7:30 and we had to ask captain for loading our staff. We had only a few bags, so it was possible. My advice – do not take such a risk The ferry ride takes 2.5 hours. It is plenty of time, so have a book or take a long conversation with other tourists. There is simple buffet breakfast served on the boat. It is not especially good, but you will find something eatable.After arriving Dry Tortugas everybody take their stuff and load it in the wheelbarrows. Campground is just two hundred meters away. Try to find shady place. There are only few of them. During boat stay you have to use boat restrooms, not compost ones located near the campground. There are not showers nor water in the campground, so best idea is to bring your own camp shower, you can buy for $15. Otherwise you can take shower on the boat.Dry Tortugas is extremely hot and sunny! Be prepared having sunscreen and ideally beach shade. Island is also dry, so you must have plenty of water – at least 2 gallons per person per day. Fortunately, you can drink free ice cold water on the boat. We have used charge cooler available free of charge for tourist. Of course, ice must be bought on the boat. It is $6 for 10 pound bag so it is better idea to bring your own cooler filled with ice in Key West.Campground place is equipped with grill, but unfortunately it is forbidden to bring on boat flammable gas or liquids, so charcoal or wood are only practical ways to make food. You have got rights to eat lunch on the boat, but it is awful, so you'd better prepare your own. It is possible to buy non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks, snacks and ice cream. Prices are acceptable. Take a look at included picture with prices.You can spend time while on the island walking in the Fort Jefferson, swimming, snorkeling or canoeing. In case of this last activity it is good idea to rent canoe or sea ​​kayak. There are two especially attractive snorkeling places – find it on the attached picture.After departing the boat island is even more beautiful. Have some wine and look at the stars. So gorgeous sky!At 10:30 in the morning boat is arriving, people pour out of the boat and magical island disappears. I highly recommend staying overnight in Dry Tortugas. Because of high temperatures it is not easy, but I promise, you will enjoy.","August 11, 2014",It is a must while in Florida,122,"Warsaw, Poland",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Firstly, Just to set the record straight- DTNP is not part of Florida. Secondly, despite the huge distance of 70 miles between DTNP and the United States- you will find crocodiles there! 'Tortugas' came from the fact that it use to be covered with sea turtle nests, but the Europeans decimated the entire population- as they did with almost everything they encountered.The Yankee Freedom III - you will find the ferry at 100 Grinnell St, Key West. It's a modern catamaran that is hardly two years old- my son LOVED IT and the crew is fantastic and the trip is slightly over 2 hours even at top speed. My advise is to stay OUTSIDE and enjoy the beauty of passing the Marquesa Islands and Boca Grande- you are on a trip through paradise- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE INSIDE on the outward trip???????? You can also see dolphins swimming just in front of the YF III- if you stay inside you'll miss it.There are also fresh water rinses on the YF III- so bring a change of clothes with you after you leave DTNP- no reason to go back all salty etc etc. THEY WILL provide you free of charge with snorkeling equipment- as well as breakfast and lunch. The BEST place to snorkel is at the north coaling dock ruins. If you go to the National Park Service Dry Tortugas page- you will find a web cam which shows marine life under the boathouse!!!!If you are EXPERIENCED at snorkeling- your top spot is the south coaling dock ruins (Starts about 65 yards from western edge of moat wall) , which have the metal pilings - the remains of old coaling docks. Countless sea life calls this area 'home' and you'll never forget it. The south coaling area will be to your LEFT as you leave the ferry and walk towards the fort. Finally- Explore the fort, but don't waste too much time there or laying on the beach- you are at - in my opinion- the most amazing coral reef in North America- GO SNORKELING.","August 11, 2014",Inside Facts & Tips For An Amazing Day,139,"The Woodlands, Texas",5

They can also provide snorkel gear for use at the park. The seaplane is faster and fun, especially when the pilot lands and takes off from the water. Once at the park you are surrounded by stunning ocean vistas surrounding an impressive fort. Fort Jefferson was the jailed location of Dr. Mudd, the man who set the bone of John Wilkes Booth after he assassinated President Lincoln.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Take the seaplane excursion. Worth the extra money. Fabulous overhead views. Saw a few sharks, turtles( too many to count) and ship wrecks from plane ride. It was a very smooth take off and landing. Not to mention really cool landing in the water. My entire family gets motion sick easily. One round of Dramamine prior to take off and we all were fine. Our first snorkeling adventure. Easy access from beach. We even rounded the corner and followed some more experienced folks to the pylons were their were bigger fish and coral. A very cool experience for our family. The fort is very interesting and you can spend as little or as much time as you want wondering around.

The park itself a lot of people said that 2.5 hours was enough time to visit & I agree (at least in the heat). Spent about 1.5 hours touring the fort & then about 1 hour snorkelling. It was a great time and I think 2.5 hours was plenty.","August 4, 2014",Great National Park,28,"Charlotte, North Carolina",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the floatplane there early on an August morning. In Florida, that can mean unusual weather at any time. We booked the first flight out, and planned on spending the entire day. Upon arriving, we were made aware that there was a weather system that may cause us to cue the trip short, and that we would be refunded the difference between a full day and half day trip. We arrived on the island about 8:45 AM, and enjoyed the experience of the plane ride. We had the island and fort pretty much to ourselves until about 10:30. We were able to tour the fort (all levels) and the moat walkway prior to the boat arriving. It was a great experience. Very scenic and historic, and gives you a great viewing horizon while on the roof. We could hear thunder in the distance, and see the associated storm. We were finishing our lunch in the hopes of moving toward the beach, aware that we had to check in with the pilot who had come back for the other half day trippers.. We were told that for weather reasons we needed to cut the trip short and return back home. We did make it back safely, and the expected weather did hit Key West. Long story short, great experience. Plan the whole day so you can see the fort, and have time left over for the beach and snorkeling.","August 4, 2014",Worth the trip,62,"Elmhurst, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was a little skeptical of paying $170 and missing most of the day in Key West, but I'm so glad we did. The ferry ride is about 2 1/2 hours each way, and you need to arrive around 7AM and will return at 5PM. We both brought books and read most of the way there and back. The seas were smooth, less than 1 foot, so reading might not be as fun on rougher seas. We did spend some time out on the deck, but it was hot and inside was comfortable. You have a lot of freedom to explore once you arrive at the fort. We took a self guided tour, then snorkeled most of the afternoon. The ferry serves breakfast (eggs, yogurt, bagels, cereal, pastries, yogurt) and lunch (sandwiches ham/turkey with chips and cookies).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The trip to the Dry Tortugas on the Yankee Freedom III is about 2.5 hours each way. The ferry is comfortable and there is food and beverages for sale as well as an included breakfast (hard boiled eggs, yogurt, un-toasted bagels, cereal, orange juice) and lunch (make your own sandwiches ham/turkey; fruit, cheese, chips, soda, and water are supplied). They supply the snorkel equipment but you need to bring your own beach towels. You can (and should) bring your own snorkel equipment if you have it. There is a self guided tour of Forty Jefferson which the crew suggests you take (they can only do a guided tour of 25 at a time). The self guided tour was a bit disappointing. You follow the guide signs around the fort and there are information placards that give you some insight into the fort and its history. But the placards are very old and some are really hard to read. Most of the pictures on the placards have been so faded by the sub that you can't really make them out. Definitely opt for the GUIDED tour.Everyone raves about the snorkeling. It is quite good. You can go out to either of two sets of pilings and look around the coral that has grown about them. You can also swim from the north to south (or vice versa) beaches around the moat wall. There's a lot of sea life to be seen and the swimming is very easy. Do this once. Unless you have a hankering to camp there, there is no reason to go back. But it is definitely worth the trip.","August 2, 2014",Something you have to do once,63,"Dallas, Texas",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"It's a long ferry ride (private charter boats or seaplanes are also available), but the snorkeling around the Tortugas is totally worth the trip. From the beach East of the ferry landing, go around the jetty to the right and snorkel around the old pier pilings. I've never seen so many fish outside of an aquarium. Yellowtails, angels, jacks and more will swim right up to your mask, like they're checking you out, too. Even a small baracuda--who kept a mutually respectful distance. I recommend buying an inexpensive ""fish finder"" placard on the ferry, so you will know what you are looking at. And, of course, swim with a buddy, for safety's sake.While the snorkeling was the highlight for me, there is also the tour of Fort Jefferson, rich in history--recommend a guidebook or a guide, to get the most of your tour. And the natural scenery around the island is breathtaking.Of course, then there's the ferry ride back (unless you stay to camp on the Tortugas)…but this ride seems shorter once they open the bar!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I and my wife decided (she decided) to visit this Dry Tortuga s for two nights, to take advantage of the snorkeling opportunities. We were able to book the trip via the Freedom Ferry out of Key West. We had a ball! The weather was miserably hot, The water was wonderful! Snorkeling was fantastic! The campground site we claimed (5) was very good, Beach was right over a little rise. Sunsets were The hermit crabs that are constantly on the move in various configurations (shell sizes--some quite huge) were quite entertaining. Especially at night when one got stuck bumping into our tent, till I went out an re-positioned him to more navigational turf. The instructions were very good, we discovered that we could survive on items such as oatmeal, slim fast and nutrition bars and water very well. I purchased a Sterno stove and Sterno and this worked perfectly for morning coffee and breakfast. We are in our mid 60's and do recommend more substantial sleep mats than we had. We also learned by our neighbors mistakes that you must stow food properly. There are critters (rodents) that want it and will be very aggressive in their efforts to get at it. So pay heed to the State park guidelines. No different than bears in Yellowstone. Fort Jefferson, which is on Garden Key, also is a very interesting place to visit. There is a State Parks museum and store inside the park which is a must visit. (also Air Conditioned). It is a few hundred $$ to do this, however it is well worth the cost and a once in a lifetime experience. Be prepared for Rustic. You will enjoy this trip.","July 31, 2014",On a almost deserted Island,8,"Charleston, South Carolina",4

The fort is pretty if you're into that kind of stuff (military history). If you are, you can walk around the fort and explore. I went with my family and we took the Yankee Freedom to Dry Tortuga. Breakfast and lunch was included in the ferry fee. Breakfast was great (eggs, toast, bagels, cheeses, juices, yogurts and coffee) But the lunch was pretty bad (turkey or tuna sandwiches with egg salad/ chips and cookies and soft drinks) But hey for being included in the price I guess its not soo bad.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The ride over in the seaplane was amazing, but you can go by boat which takes a lot longer, but may be nice... I just could not do a boat for that long.....I took so many gorgeous photos from the plane above of the sea and land below and I think that made all the difference between flying and boating over...the views were gorgeous from above. The fort at the national park is very historical to the Civil War, so, if you are a CW or history buff, this is a great place to visit and learn. Snorkeling was fun, but didn't see a ton of fish that day...but just being in that pristine and clear water was an event in itself. The trip is a bit pricey by seaplane and you don't get a ton of time to snorkel and explore the Fort .... a four-five hour stay would be perfect to explore and then have time to relax, and they do offer a longer day for more money, but we had about 2/2 1/2 hours to explore on the less expensive excursion. Overall, it is a great day trip just for the seaplane ride itself and the gorgeous waters of Dry Tortuga and to see and learn about a piece of American history. I would recommend. Bring a cooler with you to store the cold drinks the seaplane company includes for free and your own sandwiches/snacks. You need towels and sun screen.

There's a beautiful beach for swimming, a neat fort to check out and best of all there was great snorkeling. We snorkeled around the old pilings and there were so many fish!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I agree with other reviewers that this trip was completely worth it. The Yankee Freedom crew and boat were excellent, the crew and naturalists offered informative tours of the marine life around the Fort and the history of the Fort, and the snorkeling and swimming in the clear, light-blue water filled with fish were unforgettable. The food was much higher quality than we'd anticipated and the crew were so well organized, running a really great ship on every level of detail. The boat was comfortable and made for a pleasurable ride there and back-- we commented to each other on how the 2 1/2 trip flew by. Our crew historian/guide really brought passion to his recounting of the history of the Fort and lit up his tour of what is a very forbidding old structure. This was an unforgettable day in the Keys and I can't recommend the experience enough. Highlights of the trip across the ocean to the national park: seeing flying fish leaping out of the water and flying over the waves, and sea turtles surfacing to nibble seaweed! There is NO SHADE on the island except for inside the fort, and under a few scraggly stands of trees. If you want to set up your towels and stuff in some kind of natural shade, I recommend that as soon as you get off the boat, you head for the one area of trees by the little beach, and stake out a claim in one of the very spots that hasn't already been claimed by the campers who stay on the island. NOTE to shade seekers who want to do the tours: As the crew lets you sign up for the tours just before you dock and the tours begin about fifteen minutes after landing, if you move quickly you will be able to position your stuff in some shade and get back in time for the tours. However, many people just went straight to snorkeling and we can see why: the water is fabulous. You will want to bring plenty of sunscreen, hats, umbrellas, etc. The crew provide plenty of fresh water in both bottled and jug form, which really helps.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Finally had the opportunity to take the Yankee Freedom III out to the Dry Tortugas National Park and historic Fort Jefferson and we're so glad we went! From the nice lady at the ticket booth where we purchased our passage last week, to the folks at check-in, to Captain Mark, Bob, Liz, Austin, Monica, and ""Magic"" Meg, we were greeted by smiles and friendly chats with all of the crew members from the clean and well-appointed ferry boat, The Yankee Freedom III. The smooth, 2.5 hour trip each way was smooth, enjoyable and relaxing...especially when the seemingly unsupervised children got settled down (Note to Parents: Bring something for your kids to do... quietly). A continental breakfast buffet is served early and although basic, it's more than adequate for the 150 or so passengers that are comfortably fit on a boat rated for about 200 folks. Upon arrival around 10:30 a.m., you have the option of getting off the boat and immediately exploring Fort Jefferson or waiting a few minutes for the crew to get the snorkeling gear ready to hand out and hit the crystal clear water surrounding the fort. Lunch is served from 11 a.m to 1 p.m., also buffet-style, and is fresh and filling. Shade is hard to find at either of the two beaches available for swimming and snorkeling, so bring sunscreen, beach towels, a nice broad-brimmed hat, and water shoes may be handy for those that opt to not don flippers while snorkeling. The rocky bottoms can be uncomfortable to tender feet. The boat has a couple of big coolers of water where you can refill water bottles to carry with you to the beach and fort. They also provide complimentary soft drinks and bottled water during the lunch period, so you can take advantage of that, too. Small, soft-sided coolers are good to bring with bottled water, but no alcohol or glass bottles are permitted on board the boat. Snorkeling around the fort's moat walls and the coral formations can provide some beautiful underwater scenery and some good photo ops if you have an underwater camera (which are sold on board the ship in the Galley Store). The crew wants everyone back on the boat by 2:45 so you can get under way by 3. We had everyone on board and accounted for early enough to leave about 20 minutes early...except for the aforementioned wild bunch, who apparently could not tell time nor follow directions. Luckily, the bar opens in the Galley area at 2:00, and adult beverages are sold at very reasonable prices. Beer, wine, and well drinks are $4, frozen drinks are $5-6 depending on what you want. The crew holds a drawing for a free round-trip ticket on the return segment, and a raffle for a t-shirt. Piped-in music from Radio Margaritaville added to the tropical feeling and hearing ""One Particular Harbour"" as we cruised back into Key West Harbor past the ships, shops, and scenery was a fitting end to a busy, but satisfying day...","July 28, 2014",Smooth Sailing and Smiling Faces,51,"Cedar Park, Texas",5

It's kind of like a roulette wheel, you may get calm waters, you may get rough. We had rough waters going out and coming back.The breakfast was good. We didn't do lunch, because we took that time to do our own exploring on the island. I cannot say enough how impressed I was with the crew and staff!

Nothing special but it was all fresh. Also a lunch buffet was put out on arrival. It was better than breakfast as there was a lot more choices with the usual sandwich fixings and chips and sodas. Upon arrival, we toured the fort without a guide as it was easy to read the markers and follow the route. If you have trouble walking, you may want to skip the tour as there are lots of stairs and grassy and uneven areas. Snorkeling gear is free use so no need to carry your own. The snorkeling on the beach was really nice. Clean, clear water. Not much to see as there are no reefs around the fort. I did however find a lot of live conch shells. Lots of small fish and even a barracuda. On the way back a bar is open with mixed drinks as well as frozen cocktails. The price is about average for these drinks. Downside for us was after lunch no bottled water of sodas unless you pay. For the price of the trip, this should be included. We found the price of the tickets to be on the high side. I know it's a long way to the fort, but the price is way out of line for most people. At $170 per person it is not in line with most tours of this caliber.

Dry Tortugas National Park,Omg! Amazing experience. Well worth the money. Water was beautiful and warm. First time snorkeling and you have to pretty much learn as you go but you can snorkel straight off the beach and take the time to get acclimated. You're provided with floating vest if desired and as soon as you step in the water theirs hundreds of fish around you. The ride up was beautiful and relaxing. Bathed outside in the sun. The fort was an amazing site to behold and wander around. Wish we had more time to spend. Will have to visit in the future and camp for at least one night,"July 21, 2014",Amazing!,10,"Brooklyn, New York",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a great way to spend the day and something everyone should do at some time in their lives. You can take a seaplane, your own private boat or else the Yankee Freedom. We opted for the Yankee Freedom. The boat ride is about 2 1/2 hours long. When you first get on the boat, you are offered a buffet breakfast which had quite a bit of variety. Also included in the price with the breakfast is a buffet lunch with all sorts of sandwich fixings or salad fixings as well as snorkel equipment. When we first got there, we toured the fort on our own. They do offer guided tours included in the price that you can sign up for, but for us, we wanted to explore it on our own which is very easy to do since they have very well written write ups all around the fort. We then snorkeled the rest of the day. The water here is crystal clear and it was fun seeing the coral and fish in several locations that they tell you about on the boat ride over. There is a beach area on the north side and the south side of the island. The only thing I would stress is for you not to forget your sun block. I know that this may seem obvious, but there were several on our sailing that didn't use any and by the end of the day, they looked pretty much like lobsters and I imagine they weren't too comfortable after that. There are no bathroom facilities on the island, other than for the campers, so you go to the boat for your food, your bathroom needs and if you just want to cool off for a bit in the air conditioning. All in all, this is an amazing day and I would highly recommend it.","July 21, 2014",What a wonderful day!!!!,150,New Hampshire,5

Skip the first tour and pack up your lunch and head over to the north side piling for snorkeling - the water is clearer if you go earlier and the fish are beautiful - we saw many many painted fish, barracuda, tarpon and awesome schools of fish. The water gets cloudier once the first tour is over and everyone else gets in the water. Great lunch offered by the Yankee Freedom, smooth ride and helpful staff. Loved it!","July 20, 2014",AMAZING,13,"Charleston, South Carolina",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The trip is other-worldly. Start out with easy reservations on the Yankee Freedom, lots of parking, and smooth check-in and boarding. A great breakfast is waiting for everyone. You pass by outlying keys like the Marquesas and you get just enough historical information from the National Park guides. When you get to Garden Island, Fort Jefferson looks ominous and intriguing. We explored the fort first. So cool! We got our snorkeling equipment and swam around the fort in the warmest turquoise water. At one point I looked up and a four-foot silver tarpon was right in front of me only a few feet away! (I’m not a strong swimmer, but they give you vests and noodles.) I saw lots of beautiful tropical fish and colorful coral. Several times I found myself in a cloud of iridescent minnows.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Visit the Dry Tortugas national park for some great snorkeling and touring of a very interesting old fort (Fort Jefferson)/prison. If you take the ferry, it's a 2.5 hour ride, the seaplane is quicker but more expensive. If you are only interested in beaches, basic snorkeling stay in Key West... This is not the trip for you. The snorkeling in the coal piers is pretty awesome, but the coral heads a ways off shore are even better (hard to find and a pretty long swim... Don't try if not experienced). Not sure why people would bring small children on this trip (especially considering the 2.5 hours of ferry ride in each direction). There is very little on the island that is appropriate for small children... Wait till they are older. The fort was very interesting (if you like old forts...

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the seaplane as the ferry was fully booked. Took an 8 AM seaplane, which left us with very few people on the island for most of our trip. The ride out and back was stunning, the fort was very interesting (but sweltering hot in July!) and the snorkeling was excellent. Don't think I would have been happy taking the ferry, too many hours out in the sun for me, with very little shade available on the island.My only gripe is this is a national park and I don't understand how they haven't put a trip in place that is affordable - $600 for 2 on a seaplane and I think $350 for 2 on the Ferry will keep most people from ever being able to enjoy this National Park. That is a shame and the National Parks should be able to offer a more affordable ferry trip!","July 17, 2014","Great trip, just waaaay too expensive",66,"Wellington, FL",4

Some of our group had been seasick on other trips- not so here! Our guide, Ryan at the Fort was very knowledgeable- and you could spend more time if you don't want to snorkel. The swimming and snorkeling were great- ask the campers what wildlife they have seen and you won't be sorry! For those that want a beer on the way back, they have a cash bar that opens when they leave the island.

Eerily quiet as you explore the 3 levels of the fort, you can almost hear the voices of the men that served here.

It's a long day , so bring a change of clothes , hat & towels. several people on our boat had coolers & pop up tents to use on the beach . These were decent beaches around this civil war era fort, which is cool for history buffs, but the snorkeling was the highlight for me. Not sure we needed a full day out there, so I probably wouldn't recommend the all day trip on the ferry unless unless you are an avid snorkeler or beach bum.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It is hard to describe the scope of this place. You have to pack in a lot of different things in short amount of time. We started with exploring the impressive Fort Jefferson. It was like stepping back in time wondering around it massive hallways. The views of the surrounding landscape from the top of the fort were amazing. Take time to notice the small things about the fort , one thing is how stalactites and stalagmites are forming on the floors and ceiling around the fort. I'm a bit of the history buff and standing in Dr. Mudd's cell was very special thing for me. After lunch it was time to check out snorkeling around the fort. I was very impressed with the amount of corals and fish life around the old dock area and moat wall. This place doesn’t compare with the Great Barrier Reef ,but for being one of few coral reef areas in the USA it was very cool. My only complaint comes from the fact we were not informed about a crocodile that has taken up residence around the fort. He was blown off course by a hurricane a number of years ago and now lives around the fort. I happen to come within about 20 yards of him snorkeling around the fort and it was a surprise, but it turned into a kind of neat story.","July 10, 2014",Awesome place to explore,2,,5

Americans interested in their own history though would certainly enjoy many aspects of the site. Having only been snorkeling once before (and the day before), I thought it was fine. My equipment didn't work as well as it had the day prior, and I only saw a bit of coral, but did see a number of really beautiful fish! So overall, it was a pretty fun experience.I cannot stress this enough - BRING SUNSCREEN AND A WIDE-BRIM HAT!

The breakfast and lunch were very good and more than adequate. If anyone does get sea sick, Dramamine is recommended but our trip was very smooth with no issues (hubby did wear the patch just in case but it probably wasn't necessary). We did not do the guided fort tour but walked thru ourselves. They offered other tours - one of which we did which was a naturalist tour along the moat wall about marine life. It was good but the weather was so hot we just wanted to get in the water! Now onto the snorkeling! It was phenomenal! None of us had snorkeled prior but they had a video on board the boat on the way to the island which helped a lot. We loved the snorkeling so much - just wished we would have had more time to do it!The time goes so fast. As other reviewers have stated, if you are gonna do a fort tour or other non water activities, do them first, eat lunch, and then spend the rest of the time enjoying the pristine waters and all it had to offer.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was looking for something special to do with my teenage son and decided to take him camping at Dry Tortugas National Park. Overall, it was a wonderful experience ... I would definitely recommend this to any family (especially dads) wanting to make memories that will last a lifetime. The ferry ride to/from Dry Tortugas (on the Yankee Freedom) was nice and comfortable. The park staff were kind and willing to assist anyway they could. I was really impressed.Personally, I think we stayed the right amount of time ... 3 days / 2 nights. Long enough to enjoy snorkeling (and touring Fort Jefferson) at different times during the day ... and to experience the island with and without the daily visitors. The two things I enjoyed the most: (1.) swimming in the shallow water in the evenings watching the sunset, and (2.) walking around the moat at night (looking for Carlos the saltwater crocodile). These will be special moments with my son that I will treasure always.Observations / Recommendations for campers:(1.) I think one gallon of water per day per camper is enough ... unless you plan to use water for bathing or rinsing dishes or something like that. (Lots of campers were trying to give away water when we visited.)(2.) DEFINITELY bring a can or two of sterno ... even if you bring charcoal. (One night the wind got up and I couldn't get the charcoal lit ... so I spread sterno over a couple of briquettes and was able to get a fire going in no time.)(3.) If you're on the heavy side (like me) ... or sweat profusely (like me) ... then you might want to invest in a battery operated fan. We camped in late June and it was breezy at night ... but hot in the tent (especially if you batten down the hatches for the occasional rain or thunderstorm).(4.) Bring good walking shoes for touring the fort ... and watch those kiddies on the second and third levels. (There are MANY open spaces where a person could easily fall.)(5.) Bring a treat for the park staff (beverage, snack items, whatever) ... it could score you an ""after hours"" trip through the fort.(6.) Watch out for the hermit crabs ... they're everywhere at night. (You'll want everyone to have their own flashlight.)(7.) Bring umbrella chairs if you don't like sitting on picnic tables ... there's nowhere else to sit.(8.) Visit the ""Visitor Center / Gift Shop"" during the day to remind yourself how wonderful conditioned air really is. Plus, there are several interesting exhibits worth seeeing.(9.) Don't worry about bringing garbage bags ... the Yankee Freedom ferry provides their own bags to campers.(10.) If you need ice ... the Yankee Freedom sells it. I can't remember exactly how much it costs ... but it was well worth it (extremely cold and solid ... better than most convenience stores).","July 7, 2014",Great Camping Experience!,25,"Toney, Alabama",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"In my three times in Key West, my biggest dislike are the throngs of people at every corner. It's even worse when the cruise ships stop in. My wife and I took a flight down to the Dry Tortugas for a half-day tour. It's not really enough time because we wanted to tour the giant fort and snorkel prior to heading back. This was the best snorkeling (although we aren't experts) that we experienced in the Key West area. Also, we found some interesting history....several of the conspirators in the Lincoln assassination were kept at the fort. Kind of like our current day Guantanamo Bay. Snorkeling here is in extremely calm waters. Follow the coast and you can get lots of good Go Pro video. I would suggest using a red filter, even though the water is fairly clear and sunny. This is something that, by reading a lot of reviews ahead of time, I didn't think I would need. If you're doing the half day trip, you definitely want to have a game plan going into it. You can also do a boat ride out here, but that is at least two hours each way. Time is just as valuable as money is to me on vacation.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wow!!!!!! If you are deciding to go or not I strongly urge you to go.......this place is so beautiful, the water, snorkeling, beaches are simply Awesome!! The staff on board were so friendly and helpful. The day we went it was sunny, hot and beautiful to see all the clear blue waters.We will for sure go back and bring our 3 boys now that we have experienced it ourselves and feel its a great place they too would enjoy!!!Suggestions: 1. Park off Grinnell Street as the directions state but not the covered parking that is closest to the ferry terminal because the lot is private with no signs and the parking ticket machine doesn't work so you will waste time looking for change when it doesn't work at all......park down the street from the ferry that has another covered parking garage.2. Make sure you are at the ferry terminal by 0715-0730 because you will have to obtain a pass that allows you onboard.3. Remember what you bring with you on the ferry you have to take with you when the ferry docks. You can leave it on the docks by the picnic tables or carry to where you want to hang out on the beach. They have you exit the ferry when they dock so they can clean up the ferry for lunch and off load those who have camping gear onboard. Then you can come back onboard around 11-1 when they serve lunch and then be back to the ferry no later than 2:45pm when the ferry leaves to return back to Key West. Bring your own sunscreen and beach towels.4. A good use of time is......once the ferry arrives to the island at approx 1015 leave your items on the dock by the picnic tables then go walk around the Fort, this way you can head back to the ferry to eat your lunch around 11ish and then the rest of your time from approx 1130- 230 to grab your snorkel gear and go snorkel and enjoy the beaches and move around to a couple sides of the island to see it all. We started on the East side with great sights of snorkeling......East side is the beach you first see when you come up to seeing the island before docking......when in doubt ask the crew and they will tell you also. 5. Head to the fresh water shower rinses onboard the ferry around 2:00 so you can change to dry clothes and walk around some more if you want until you have to check-in no later than 2:45. 6. The breakfast and lunch buffets served are good and plenty to fill you up. When you board at 2:45 to head back to the ferry they open the bar for drinks and the prices are very reasonable and they have an open snack bar if you want burgers, hotdogs, pretzels...etc for decent prices. They also sell several things like candy, Tshirts, towels, underwater disposable cameras.7. I personally wouldn't recommend this type of activity for kids under age 7-8 and for sure not infants......it's too hot and not really a place for infants. 8. Bring plenty of sunscreen....you will get a lot of sun on and off the boat. There isn't a lot of shade on the island. 9. Have a blast and enjoy the sights. Have fun!!!!","July 5, 2014",Absolutely Amazing!!!!,15,"Miami, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The brouchure published for Dry Tortugas National Park, Yankee Freedom III shows beautiful blue waters. It was not like that at all. The water was brown and murky and you could hardly see in front of you when snorkeling. Snorkeling was a disappointment - however beautiful the coral and sea life was in the past is not so today. We were not told that there were salt water crocs in the water and after we got out saw one. Fort Jefferson is like most unfinished deserted forts but the history is interesting.I would not spend the money to go there again.","July 4, 2014",A Disappointment,23,"The Villages, Florida",1

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Dry Tortugas is located roughly 70 miles west of Key West. The only ways to access the park is via a chartered seaplane or ferry. My husband & I chose an enjoyable 2 1/2 hour ferry ride to the park. The ferry offered a nice breakfast and lunch, as well as clean bathrooms on board. Things to do there are - swimming, snorkeling, learn about the history of the fort, and bird watch.While at the park, we chose to do the self-guided tour of the fort. There are two stories AND the rooftop to walk on. Amazing views! Be prepared to do a lot of walking (watch your step!) and if you want to see interesting views from the 2nd floor and rooftop, I recommend wearing comfortable shoes to climb the steps to each level. If traveling with little ones, watch them carefully as the fort has not been modified to accommodate little ones. The 2nd floor openings are wide open and the rooftop is exactly that. After we toured the fort (which was VERY interesting), we chose to snorkel over to the reefs. That was a lot of fun, saw some interesting coral, and many fish. I will note though, the snorkeling gear offered wasn't that great. In the future, I'd probably purchase my own and take it. The beach areas there were nice too. Entering the water was kinda rocky - I recommend water shoes. But the beach was nice, soft sand and the water was nice and clear. NOTE: TAKE A LOT OF SUNBLOCK! We coated ourselves in spf 30 & still got burned. If you plan to visit, I assure you the visit will be very much enjoyed. I highly recommend adding this to the list of places to visit while in Key West. ","June 30, 2014",Dry Tortugas,34,"Richmond, Virginia",5

The staff on the boat were friendly and gave information, but no too much! Fort Jefferson was an amazing piece of history and the Tour Guide, who was part of the boat staff, was very knowledgeable.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wife and I took the ferry on our June trip.Lots of folks review and say they would rather take the seaplane.Well....I cannot argue that the aerial pictures would be awesome.However, being on the ocean since I was a wee lad, have got to say that the trip over and back really brings hoe the remote location of this fort. If the weather permits and you have good ""sea legs"" get on the prow railing and enjoy the ride out! Watch for sea turtles and, possibly, porpoises. Do, though, be sure to apply some sunscreen to the backs of your legs and shoulders as you will get some rays.The meals are just as the other reviewers say, continental breakfast and an above average lunch for cold cuts and chips. Be sure to take the opportunity to drink one more coke or bottle of water than you think as dehydration is very possible for those not used to being in the sun all day.We chose the self-tour as I tend to dislike walking around in a herd, but everyone that participated in the tour seemed to enjoy it. I'm just not one who likes that sort of thing.The signage around the fort and a bit of reading before the trip sufficed for us as we toured it ourselves.Be sure to go to the top level and bring your camera...the view is fantastic. However, if your are not comfortable with heights, be careful. Also, if you have small children that are not ""easily manageable"" be aware that the top level has NO railing and the edge has loose bricks. Being 35-40 feet above concrete walkways and water, this is not a place to let the young ones investigate without close supervision. Older folks should also be aware that uneven footing and vegetation could be an issue if they have balance issues. All this said, I wish I had brought our better camera instead of our underwater camera as I would have loved to had higher quality pictures of this stunning vista!!Snorkeling is great, but we chose the side of the fort closest to the landing dock. The tide is stronger here and silts up the water more than the side closest to the camping area. If w venture back, I would spend more time on that side of the fort when snorkeling.Basically and fantastic trip worth every penny.","June 27, 2014",Everyone should have on their bucket list!,8,"Greenville, Alabama",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,The Dry Tortugas was phenomenal. We ended up going by seaplane because the ferry was booked. Make sure you plan ahead for this part of the trip. Taking the seaplane ended up being great. We saw sharks and turtles from the plane and even underwater sand dunes. Then we landed and saw so much sea life it was amazing. I suggest making sure you go when the weather is good so you know you will be able to see everything. It's a trip you will never forget and made the key west trip. If you take the seaplane go early morning or late afternoon to avoid the ferry people. You will get amazing photos of the fort and sea. It's like nothing you have ever done.

It was NOT rough at all. To imagine the Fort being built out in the middle of the Gulf in the 1800s is hard. The snorkeling was good and the fort is still in decent condition. They had 8 of the 10 25-ton cannons restored when we were there. They're huge!

After we docked at Fort Jefferson, we took a guided 1/2 hour tour of the Fort. The Park Rangers were extremely accommodating and informative. After the tour, we were provided a lunch buffet, that included homemade tuna salad, cold cuts, fruit, chips, water and sodas, also included in the ticket price. After lunch, we were on our own to snorkel the South Beach and the North Beach. It is a very good place to snorkel. Snorkel equipment was provided. After snorkeling, the boat provides a fresh water shower and there is a changing room on the dock to change into dry clothes for the trip home.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I took the Yankee Freedom III to the Dry Tortugas National Park and really loved it! It is almost impossible to separate a review from the park and the ferry! We drove down from Islamorada and parked in the parking ramp - it was $12 or $13 to park for a whole day. It is about a block, or a block and a half walk to the terminal. You go into the terminal building, to the second floor and check in. You are given a number to turn in as you get onto the boat. There are restrooms and room is air conditioned as you wait to board. This is a very good time to apply your sunscreen! Also, as you wait one of the guides will start giving you information on what to expect and come around selling Dramamine for $1 a dose. I definitely recommend taking something if you are at all prone to motion sickness. Once you are on the boat, breakfast is served until 830am. It is continental style - yogurt, bagels, cereal, cold eggs, etc. The breakfast was just ok. Bagels were very dry and only plain cream cheese available, cereal ran out really fast, etc. Once you finish up eating, I suggest going outside to enjoy the beautiful views on the boat ride - you can see several turtles, flying fish and possibly dolphins, as we did during the ride. When you arrive to the Dry Tortugas, you can take a guided tour of Fort Jefferson or do your own tour. We chose to take our own tour. We went snorkeling first, on the north side, along the moat wall. We saw several kinds of fish, a star fish, and may different kinds of coral, including several colorful fan corals. I definitely recommend using water shoes, as the bottom is very rough on tender feet. I wish we had more time to try snorkeling on the south side! After snorkeling, we went on board for a quick sandwich lunch before going to tour the fort. It was SO hot the day we were there. Oh goodness, we should have toured the fort first and THEN snorkeled, so we could cool off! I couldn't stand the heat and only toured half of the fort, leaving my husband to do the rest by himself - he likes to take a lot of pictures and was taking a little too long for me to take the heat. There are not too many places you can go to get away from the heat in the summer! Just the water! The boat is kept air conditioned, but not kept too cool. I normally like the heat, but here it really got to me. Make sure you bring and reapply your sunscreen - there were a lot of ppl with sun burns on the way back! At least half of the people napped on the way back to Key West, and I nodded off for a while too. I think the sun must have taken it out of almost everyone! :) I am so glad we went and did this though, it was so beautiful and I would go back again if the chance presented itself.

The seaplane only carries 10 people and arrives about two hours prior to the ferry""s arrival with all of it's passengers, so if you take the morning seaplane you have a very peaceful visit with very few people (aside from your fellow seaplane passengers you have some campers and the park rangers); this may be the case for the afternoon seaplane ride too, ie once the ferry & the crowds leave. This allows you to tour Fort Jefferson (self guided tour) more effortlessly and allows for more time (and less crowded) snorkeling.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a must do activity in Key West. The boat ride out and back is long, and there is not a ton to see unless you get lucky and come across dolphins or something. Make sure to bring activities for kids and a book! Once you arrive, however, the Fort and the snorkeling is outstanding. The ship crew is very helpful, and provide tips on where to go. The fort tour is somewhat interesting, but if in summer be advised- it is HOT. Bring water and a hat. The main event is snorkeling. Hope for sun, and get away from the crowd. The more off the path you go, the better the scenery. Barracuda, brain corral, dozens of smaller fish species- all unafraid of humans. Pay attention to time though. Unfortunately the stay on the island is not very long given the travel time to get there, and the ship cannot signal via its horn due to environmental regs. So you have to watch the clock and get back on time.One tip- bring your own snorkel gear if you have it, or consider renting in town.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Last winter we spent a month in Florida including about five days in Key West. We had planned our trip fairly well and thought we had captured all there was to do. It was only when we arrived in Key West that we became aware of the Dry Tortugas National Park that also contained Fort Jefferson, a huge artillery arsenal whose active history began during the Revolutionary War and ended after the Civil War but it is still a draw to tourists and, perhaps, Cubans who might be trying to get to the USA. The Fort covered some of the approaches to the mainland and was also a bunkering point for warships well into the steam age.Perhaps all Americans are aware of this fascinating location but, to my knowledge, it is not well known here in the UK. It should be. It can be reached by seaplane or by fast ferry. The latter is by far the cheapest way to travel the 70 miles and that's the way we went.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Fort Jefferson is the largest masonry fort in the Western Hemisphere, with walls 40' high, 12' thick and surrounded by a moat. Constructed of over 16 million bricks, the fort is over half a mile in diameter. When I was stopping over in the late 70's as part of the US Coast Guard, the fort was accessible by boat and a small seaplane service from Key West. Today you can make the 70 mile trip in about 2 hrs via high speed catamaran service, complete with lunch and snorkeling equipment. You have 4 hrs to spend on Garden Key, home of the fort then a 2 hr return ride. And though there is no admission fee to the fort itself, the catamaran and seaplane service are fee based. This has made the fort a lot more accessible for those who enjoy history, which the fort has plenty of, and the warm, sparkling Gulf waters. The sheer size and isolated location of Fort Jefferson makes it a place to see for one's self. The entire fort, moat and interior structures were all hand made, without the aid of modern equipment. The are a few of the forts cannons on top of the wall, some weighing 23 tons and hoisted up by block and tackle alone. A true engineering marvel. And, the fort even has a connection to the Lincoln assassination as well. Go see for yourself. You won't be disappointed!","June 11, 2014",Mammoth of the Gulf,32,"McCaysville, Georgia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and I spent two nights camping at Dry Tortugas National Park. We have an absolutely amazing experience. You can go snorkeling right at the fort and see beautiful coral reefs inhabited by barracudas, tarpon, sharks, and a whole variety of tropical fish. Fort Jefferson is very impressive and if you go camping you can see an amazing sunset from the top of the fort. The rangers are extremely friendly and social. There were among the best rangers my wife and I have encountered out of our several trips to other national parks. If you bring a kayak with you, I highly recommend making the 3 mile trip over to Loggerhead Key. Sometimes the currents can be strong between the two islands, so you need to be careful and speak with the rangers about current weather conditions. However, on the particular day we chose to make the trip, the ocean the entire way across was smooth as glass--the trip only took 50 minutes one way because the ocean was so calm. At Loggerhead Key, there is an old lighthouse and the most beautiful coral reef we saw at Dry Tortugas (It's know as ""Little Africa""). On our way back to Garden Key, we had a very close encounter with ten dolphins that swirled and jumped and played in the water around our kayak--several were within less than two feet of our kayak! It was quite an amazing experience to see dolphins up so close and personal in their natural environment--it was so close in the kayak that we practically could have reached out and touched them! Camping is definitely the way to go if you want to get the full Dry Tortugas experience. The experience between 2:45pm (when the Yankee Freedom heads back to Key West) and 10:30am the following day (when the Yankee Freedom arrives at Fort Jefferson) is frankly much better than when the Yankee Freedom is in port--170 people on the island when the Yankee Freedom is in port as compared with only 20 people on the island when the Yankee Freedom leaves. There is nothing else quiet like the experience of spending the night on an island 70 miles from civilization with only around 20 other people on island in the middle of the ocean.","June 9, 2014",Absolutely Amazing Camping Experience!,22,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Spent a few days in key West and signed up for the Seaplane trip to the Dry Tortugas. it was a spectacular time! Do NOT make the mistake of taking the Ferry (3 1/2 hours). Take the seaplane (1 hour) that flies about 200 feet over the water so you can see the sharks and huge sea turtles in the clear green water. Landing and taking off from the beautiful water is an experience you won't forget. We had Captain Evan. Great guy. First place Captain I ever saw fly a plane...barefoot! Cool dude. He had Jimmy Buffet and other cool music playing the whole way there and back and pointed out all the interesting sites including shipwrecks, Cuban boats abandoned on the small islands where refugees landed etc. When you get to the Fort make sure to snorkel. Really nice coral and fish. Do this trip! Highly recommended.","June 9, 2014",GREAT experience! Do not miss this one,172,"Tampa, Florida",5

The ride out wasn't bad, but the ride back was pretty bumpy. They advised us in the morning of the conditions and to take motion sickness meds if we thought we'd need them. They also sell Dramamine for $1. Fort Jefferson is amazing. I can't even imagine the engineering that was involved. The views, even on a cloudy day with weather rolling in was gorgeous. It must be simply spectacular on a sunny and clear day. This trip was pricey, but if you can do it, I'd say go for it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,This civil war era fort has a lot of history and they let you roam basically everywhere except one part of the fort where they have placed gaudy portable buildings within sight of the tour area. It looks like crap. It also seems the pace of reconstructing this fort which they let fall apart for a long time is slow. The beauty can't be matched.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"There is a 2.5 hour boat ride to get from Key West to the key that Fort Jefferson sits on. The Yankee Freedom III is the boat that gets you there. It is comfortable enough, but certainly not luxurious. Fort Jefferson is a massive brick structure that is very interesting to explore, especially if you put yourself into the position of those soldiers who lived on this remote island. The snorkeling is free and quite spectacular. The North Beach is rougher than the South Beach, and my experience indicated that the South Beach has more marine life to see. I saw many different types of fish, both large and small, and a massive stingray. The boat sells averagely priced liquor and beer on the way back. The trip price is a little steep at $170 a person, but you do get a continental breakfast and picnic-like lunch on the boat.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I opted for the amphibious airplane experience to get to the Dry Tortugas and I was not at all disappointed - what an outstanding way to see more of The Keys. Dry Tortugas is situated 68 miles off of the coast of Key West in the Gulf of Mexico. The park itself is comprised of great snorkeling, boats anchored in the little harbor area, tons of birds including lots of pelicans, a lot of fish, 7 islands, and Fort Jefferson. The fort can be visited in about an hour or so, depending on how much time you reserve for exploring, swimming, and snorkeling. There's a gift shop, which was closed during my visit, and a changing room area near the docks. There is no food of any kind for purchase at the park. If you're flying in as I did, a small cooler of beverages is provided. Bring snacks, a hat, water, sunscreen, bathing suit, dry clothes to change into, snorkeling gear, a towel, sunglasses. Your National Park admission fee will be collected in cash in advance of your departure from Key West.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Key West's beaches weren't super awesome, but the beaches on Dry Tortugas were exactly what you'd hope for on a tropical island. Long white sandy beaches, crystal clear water on the west beach (even though the wind was 20 MPH from the East,) and even some shady spots to read a book and listen to the waves.The fort itself was interesting to walk around for about 1/2 an hour. There was a bit of a self guided tour you could follow along yourself. It was fun to climb all the way to the top and walk around and see the expanse of the ocean all around. I would agree to a previous commentator's statement that it is a monument unto questionable government spending, ha ha.There is lots of wildlife to see - the migrating African Terns were on the offshoot from the island in the thousands. Kiiiinda had an Alfred Hitchcock vibe going on, but they were all well away from the fort and the beaches. We also saw pelicans, a variety of fish snorkeling (including a shark,) and we even saw a pair of dolphins and schools of flying fish on the ferry ride out.Speaking of the ferry - it's worth noting what kind of waves you have in store for the ride out and back before buying tickets. We found out that it was going to be 9 - 12 foot waves on the trip due to the stiff breeze that had happening for the last few days. The ride out was decent since we were going with the wind, but the ride back got very exciting at times, and lots of folks made their way to the back of the boat looking pretty green around the gills. All in all, it was probably the biggest adventure we had on our Key West trip, and we're both very glad we went!","June 1, 2014",Exciting Ferry Ride,5,"Andover, Minnesota",4

You will see many species of fish and coral. The fort is beautiful and you can either self tour or tour with a group. There are plenty of places to snorkel, camp, etc. The water is shallow enough for beginner snorkelers to enjoy.The downside is that shade is scarce. I would strongly recommend bringing sunglasses, hats, sunblock, and some type of umbrella for shade. I forgot to bring my sunglasses and suffered burnt retinas as a result.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you go from Key West to Dry Tortugas National Park, which is predominantly water, It might be worth it to reserve a half day seat on the seaplane trip (8am, 10am, noon and 2pm) rather than take the ferry. The seaplane costs $280 per person, but it gets you there in 45 minutes and flies low enough that you can see dolphins and shipwrecks, etc. The ferry is cheaper but it takes almost 2 hours each way and once you get to the fort you are there ALL DAY. The fort is very interesting. Park rangers are helpful and informative, The exhibits, gift shop and trails are excellent. There are beautiful beaches for snorkeling and plenty of picnic spots. If you go by seaplane you should have exactly the right amount of time there. Check out Dry Tortugas website for links to reserve, and don't wait until you are down there because it fills up. If you go by ferry, it is also advisable to book that online in advance. The ferry provides breakfast on the way, and lunch while you are at the fort. For anyone who gets seasick, the ferry ride can be rough. Unless the weather is bad in the morning, they will go out as scheduled. That means that if the sea turns rough, you will be riding back through it, and a lot of folks on the ferry had mal de mer big time.

Upon arrival, we went on the narrated fort tour and really enjoyed the great information that was shared with us. Afterward, we took to the beach for some snorkeling. Contrary to what I have read in other reviews, I thought that the snorkeling was fantastic. I have snorkeled throughout the Caribbean and Florida Keys many times over the past decade or so and this was one of my favorite spots. The pilings near the main dock allow you to swim through massive schools of bait fish on the way to weaving your way through a grid of wooden poles where I saw barracuda, parrot fish and even a large wahoo once near the edge of the piling network where the water was deeper. After that, I went to the smaller beach where I swam by myself around the corner to the other set of pilings where the water was more turbulent but patience while swimming through the shallow water allowed me to see the largest, most beautiful parrot fish that I had other seen. There were lots of coral formations attached to the pilings. I definitely had to be patient and take my time picking my way through the area but it was well worth the effort.All said, we had a great time.","May 17, 2014",Great historical site with excellent snorkeling,33,"Hilton Head, South Carolina",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I were very impressed with ingenuity that went into the building of Fort Jefferson. Unfortunately, this beautiful brick fort is slowing disintegrating due to the iron supports rusting and expanding and exerting pressure on the walls. Also rain is causing decay of the mortar as the lime is leached out of it. In one of the passage ways active stalactites/stalagmites were in the process of forming. Thankfully, the fort is actively being repaired. There is a self-guiding tour with placards which provide explanations on how the fort operated. There are three levels to explore. I would not recommend touring the Fort with children since there are no railings on the second level or on the ramparts. The interior grounds are overgrown and we saw quite a few birds on the grounds and in the air flying over the fort. Take the time to absorb the history of the place, explore the ramparts and walk around the fort via the moat wall.","May 14, 2014",Amazing historical site.,165,California,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My ranking for this is primarily based on the fact that we took the seaplane out, if we took the ferry I think i might have a completely different take and maybe rank this site as average.The seaplane is an amazing experience, you get there quick(so no dealing with seasickness and its 30/45 min instead of 2 hours), they point out things when you fly(you can look for turtles, sharks, wrecks), when you arrive you are the only people there(except if there are campers). We went to the north beach and had the place to ourselves for almost 2 hours. The boat shows up at 10:30 and we got there around 8:45.The flight isn't cheap and it's even more expensive if you do the full day, which we thought was really good, i think a half day would have been too short.As for ""stuff"" - you can leave your stuff and no one will touch it, everyone is wandering around in their bathing suits and they just dump their gear where ever and go swimming or walking. Everyone is trapped there so there seems to be an unwritten rule that you behave. Plus its not cheap to get there so I'm guessing no one would bother paying for it just to steal someones change of clothes.Bathrooms - there are pit toilets there that are used until the ferry shows up then once the ferry is there you have to use the ferry - which has normal bathrooms(if a little small)There is no food on the island, the seaplane gave us coolers and ice to bring our own stuff I think the ferry provides lunch.Snorkeling was only ok - maybe if it was less windy it would have been better, the north beach had very poor visibility and it is a very small beach. Most people seemed to be on the other beach - its bigger and when we were there the visibility was better.The best is to go around the pylons but it was a bit rough so you couldn't really snorkel through them and again the visibility was pretty poor. There is a lot of coral on the wall but if its clear you can actually see a lot of the same stuff(coral, needle fish, the yellow and black stripy fish, the parrot fish) from the wall without going into the water. The water is quite shallow so unless you get our past the pilings you won't see anything big. One person saw a tarpon and another saw a nurse shark past the pylons by the boats but you really need to get into the deep water to see anything like that.The fort looks neat, they seem to be patching it here and there but it is in really good shape considering. We didn't spend much time in the fort, just went in and took some pictures and climbed to the top to see the cannons and the view.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I would go back to the Dry Tortugas every day if I could. I think we got lucky with the weather because the boat ride was smooth, the waters were crystal clear and the snorkeling was great. I was sad to not see a turtle, but maybe next time. A lot of people have said the snorkeling is not as good as other places, but I found it to be pretty amazing. I snorkeled the Belize barrier reef a couple of years ago and the reefs in the Dry Tortugas were way better.. I would not recommend snorkeling the pylons near the land bridge because the water is rougher and it's very shallow. You have to be a pretty good swimmer to deal with the currents and navigating through the shallow coral is a little tricky. The pylons near the kayak rental are much, much better and I saw more fish. I would recommend snorkeling the deeper water pylons, the perimeter of the fort and further out (I regret sticking close to the fort).One piece of advice - wear a t-shirt to snorkel. It will save you days of pain.","May 12, 2014",One of the most amazing trips,13,"Tallahassee, FL",5

We had rough seas going over but the staff was prepared to help anyone that needed it. They were knowledgeable and friendly to talk to. The water was choppy so snorkeling was not good unfortunately. But walking around the island using the booklet was very interesting. We didn't take the guided tour but plan on it for next time. We took some beautiful pictures.

The flight itself was both fun and interesting, altitude 400-500 feet over shipwrecks, small islands, sea life, all pointed out by our pilot. Once on the fort's island, you can tour the fort either on your own or with the National Park service, you can snorkel in crystal clear water (equipment furnished by the seaplane company), and some folks even went bird watching.

Snorkeling very good if you go to the right spots ( south and north coaling dock ruins, moat wall, and coral heads off of south swim beach. Don't listen to negative reviews of snorkeling ( they probably went to the wrong places). Saw lots of grunts, pompano, barracudas, angelfish, triggers, tangs, damsels, large schools of silversides, parrotfish, wrasses, hogfish, soft and hard corals, Christmas tree worms. One large southern stingray and medium size Goliath grouper. Would have seen more if we had more time. Fort Jefferson is fun to walk around. Tons of swallows that have been blown there by storms.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"On day one of our weeklong visit to Key West, we ventured onboard the Yankee American catamaran and sailed over to Fort Jefferson/Dry Tortugas National Park...and it was well worth visiting. Yes it takes 2-1/2 hours to get there (and back), but the ride is scenic and the visit to the island and the fort make it all worthwhile. We were caught up in the history of the fort, why it was out there all by its lonesome on a small sand dune of an island, and the folks who ran the trip were excellent sources of local knowledge.","May 9, 2014",A Must Visit When Visiting Key West,11,"Walnut Creek, California, United States",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"...Going to the Dry Tortugas has been something I have wanted to do for a long time. My wife and I decided to splurge and take the trip while we were visiting Key West. We could walk to the embarkation location and did so early in the morning. We had reserved places on the boat and boarding was well handled by the crew. We found comfortable seating inside the boat and relaxed and ate breakfast which is included on the trip. The catamaran was spotless and well maintained. (You should be aware the Dry Tortugas is a group of islands but the Garden Key with Fort Jefferson is the main attraction.) There is an entry fee for this National Park but it is included in the fee for the trip....The crew did a fine job of preparing us for the trip including warning us that sometime the water between Key West and the Tortugas gets a bit rough. There was some rough water and a number of people, including my wife, needed to use bags provided for such an event. Except for the brief rough water, the trip was rather uneventful and relaxing....When we arrived, we were able to have lunch which we took on shore and ate at a picnic table. The weather was a bit cool and windy but quite tolerable. We then choose to tour the fort on our own. Guided tours were available at no additional charge but we decided to use our printed material to explore the fort. At one end of the island is a rookery where birds -mainly Terns- were mating. A birder could spend (and some did) the whole time on the island watching these birds. They were spectacular....The fort is amazing. I have been in other forts but this one is huge and made of bricks. You can imagine the difficulty of getting a large number of bricks to this isolated island. It has been well maintained and was fun to walk through. If you go, make sure you wear good walking shoes as you have to do a bit of climbing and a lot of walking. Over the years, at the peaks of many arches, minerals have leeched from the mortar forming small stalactites with solidified mineral pools directly below on the floor. During our explorations, the sun came out and the day warmed up and turned reasonably pleasant....There is good snorkeling around the island but we never experienced it. We put on our snorkeling equipment (provided as part of the trip) but never saw any fish or coral. Unfortunately, there had been a storm a few days earlier and the water, while warm, was quite cloudy. We did experience the rather unusual coral sand which sticks to every part of your body and equipment. Fortunately, there were fresh water showers to wash off most of this sand. We still found sand on our bodies 2 days later....Someone reading this might ask if the trip was worth taking. For families, this could be an expensive trip. For nearly half price, you could go on a snorkeling trip within the keys. The weather was marginal, the snorkeling was non-existent but the fort and the birds were outstanding and the history of this place can not be ignored. In spite of some disappointments, we were glad we took the trip.","May 8, 2014",A Unique experience,124,"Warsaw, Indiana",4

My favorite moment was the beach on the right side of the fort. Never seen water so clear. Lunch was provided. Alcoholic beverages were able to be purchased on our return trip. Although not included free with the trip like Fury Tours, the prices were decent. Staff was very vary nice. Will do again in the future. ","May 8, 2014",Amazing,3,,5

I'm in the UK so it really was ""once in a lifetime"" for me.The one question I had before I went was ""toilets"". There are some composting toilets on the island (like an airplane toilet) that are usable until the ferry docks, then the ferry toilets are used, they are back in use when the ferry departs. There is no food or water on the island - anything you want, you need to bring or have on the ferry.Ask the park rangers questions; they're very knowledgable.","May 8, 2014",Wow.,130,"Birmingham, UK",5

Spend the extra money and take a sea plane. You get some awesome views of the ship wrecks in the water and you even see sharks and turtle swimming. This place was absolutely amazing in every way. I got an awful sunburn scuba diving a few days prior so we didn't snorkel. If we wanted to snorkel, We would have a some time...but not a lot.

We got a lot in while we were in the Keys but this trip blew everything else away. Highly recommend taking the Sea Plane if you can. You will see sea turtles, shipwrecks, all kinds of fish, pretty amazing being that close to the water in a plane. While at Dry Tortugas, take your time walking around the fort, just imagine what it was like to build that thing during the Civil War. The self guided tour should take you about 45 minutes. Make sure to take the stairs (yes, it's a little dark but don't be afraid) up to the 3rd floor, the views there are amazing. The snorkeling was very good, some of the nicest fish I saw were along the moat wall, try that out. Although we did not take the boat out, some of the people at the park did and said because it was windy that day, the seas were rough and quite a few people on board were sick.

It was hot, but we found some shady spots. If your tent tears down easily, sometime you can get a better spot the next day. It is lovely, fun to walk the moat wall.

Though there is a luxurious ferry service, we opted for the floatplane to save time(35 minutes vs. 2 1/2 hours each way.) The flight was spectacular with much to see including sea turtles, rays, sharks, shipwrecks, and water in every shade of blue and green. Once there, we circled Fort Jefferson, the largest brick structure in the western hemisphere. The self-guided tour was full of history and breathtaking views. The snorkeling was very good and sea birds abounded. If you choose the first or last flight, you get to be there without all the ferry passengers, though you could not call it crowded regardless.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We traveled by ferry to get to the Dry Tortugas National Park/Fort Jefferson. It is worth your day going to see this because it is pretty impressive. The fort itself is so big and it sits in the middle of the Gulf! There were 2 people from the ferry that would take a group of people on a tour of the fort if you were interested in doing so or you could do your own tour by reading a booklet they gave you or you could just walk around it yourself. We opted to just look around ourselves as the tour ate up some of your time spent on the island. It would be nice if you could get an audio headset and do your own tour by listening to that, but that isn't an option. Outside of the fort, there are various picnic tables for you to put your things (you are asked to remove all your belonging from the ferry when you arrive so they can get it ready for lunch). We found a spot on the beach where we would be spending a good part of the day. On the pier, there is a place where you can get your snorkeling gear. The gear is pretty shotty but you do get a mask, snorkel, and flippers. You can swim out to the reefs and see all kinds of fish and sea life. If you do not snorkel, you can hang on the beach, swim or walk around the fort on a walkway surrounding the fort. I saw a lot of people doing that. There were a lot of bird watchers too. There are also campers on the island. That is another option, but you would have to look into that. There is a changing place to use before you leave the island and a place to rinse your sandy feet. Overall the island is very well maintained. It is a pretty amazing sight as you get closer to the Dry Tortugas to see such a huge fort just sitting there.

Once the plane taxied to the shore, we enjoyed walking around the old fort. We learned a lot about life in the fort, and saw where Dr. Mudd was held. Sadly the brickwork is coming apart.

If you are arriving by car, the City Parking Garage is just a half block up Grinnell Street. There is no free parking in the city.

Tickets for the day trip are: $170 for adults; $160 for seniors, students 17 and over (IDs required) and active military (IDs required); and $125 for children aged 4 to 16. Tickets for camping trips are higher. The fare includes your Park fee.The trip takes two hours and 15 minutes. You arrive at Fort Jefferson on Garden Key at 10:15 am (weather depending) and depart there at 3 p.m., arriving back at Key West at 5:15 p.m.Bring a bathing suit as swimming is available from two beaches and snorkeling equipment is available from Ferry personnel. Check the Ferry Web site on what to bring and for other information.The Fort was used as a Union military prison during the Civil War (you can see Dr. Mudd's cell) and touring it is lots of fun. You can take a guided tour or be on your own and you have access to the fort's parade ground, the inside quarters and such and the ramparts on top.

The boat arrives around 10:30 and you have about 4 hours on the island. There seem to be five main interest groups on board: beach goers, snorkelers, Civil War history buffs, campers and birders. As a snorkeler I was a little disappointed in the reef you could reach from the beach but I did have a large barracuda swim about three feet under me for my thrill of the day. The birders seemed to be having a great time chasing a beautiful little green throated warbler around with their giant lenses. Overall I think this is a terrific day out on the water and away from the noise and action in KW. ","April 24, 2014",Dry Tortugas,6,"Edgartown, Massachusetts",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is an excursion not to miss when in Key West. The trip out is just over 2 hours so maybe take a book or a pack of cards. But it is well worth it as when you get there the azure sea and sandy beaches, not to mention the Fort (Jefferson) will just take your breath away. Snorkelling equipment is supplied as is Breakfast and Lunch and we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of both meals. Do this trip if it is the only thing you do!!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My girlfriend and I had long wanted to see Fort Jefferson and last November we had a friend getting married in Atlanta, so decided to make a longer trip out of it. We spent about a week and a half on our journey from Atlanta, through Savannah and Florida to Key West. The morning our our trip we met a nice fellow at our hotel from Arkansas who was a pilot for a private company and spent most of the day exploring with him. The staff aboard the Yankee Freedom were absolutely amazing. Very accommodating, courteous, knowledgable, and quick to respond to any passengers who became sick on the journey. The waiting area and ferry itself were very clean and well-maintained and the journey was pleasant and beautiful. There was a little bit of chop over some of the deeper water, but our little group just played some cards, and read the information pamphlet supplied by the tour company. The destination itself was everything we had hoped it would be. The snorkelling was excellent, as were the sights, history and the weather on the day that we went. This is one of the most unique places that I have been in the United States. I would absolutely recommend this trip to everyone. In fact, my mom and her husband will be doing the exact same trip next year, and they are very excited for it. There is also a sea plane that goes out to the islands, which I would be interested in taking if we return, if only to get some aerial photos of the area. The Yankee freedom was wonderful tour and I have only good things to say about it and its crew.","April 22, 2014",Dry Tortugas: Absolutely Stunning,10,"Tokyo, Japan",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Dry Tortugas is one of the most unique places I've ever camped. If you like to tent camp, you have to check it out. My advice, go swimming/snorkeling when all the day trippers are there. Then when they leave on the ferry, you have the fort to yourself. The snorkeling is absolutely awesome. There are some old coal docks in the water that have been growing coral reef on them for years and serve as home to LOTS of wildlfe. The most amazing snorkeling in the Keys.The fort is also really cool. Rich history. Unique design. Great setting for a campout. A word to the wise, the Yankee Freedom offers lunch with it's ferry service. If you are camping, they will give you one lunch on the day of your choice with your ticket. You can buy lunch for the remaining days for about $5 per lunch. Do it. The fresh food is totally worth it.","April 20, 2014",Camping here is amazing!,31,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom day trip to see the Dry T's. The water is crystal clear and blue. Nice beaches and great place to snorkel. The Fort is fun to walk around and great views from the top. They are making some renovations to the Fort which should be really nice when completed. (does not impact touring the Fort). This is a day trip by boat. It is definitely worth seeing, but if you can afford it a sea plane is probably a more preferable mode of transportation.","April 20, 2014",We love NP's!,117,"Lafayette, Indiana",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Traveling to the Dry Tortugas on the Yankee Freedom boat is a very long, but worthwhile day trip. They tell you to be at the boat at 7:00 a.m. for a 7:30 boarding, and you don't arrive back at Key West until about 5:30 p.m. Check in process was efficient, friendly, and helpful, and we had no problems finding seats on the boat. Narration was informative and entertaining. Buffet style breakfast and lunch were fine with several choices. Staff was friendly and wanted to please. We were lucky that the waters weren't too rough the day we went. The boat trip lasts from 8:00 to 10:30 a.m., the fort tour from 11:00 to 12:00, free time to snorkel, swim, or further explore the fort until 2:30 (the ferry provides snorkeling equipment), then the return boat ride is 3:00 to 5:30 p.m. The fort tour was well done and informative; the fort as it rises out of the sea on arrival is very impressive. The waters surrounding the island are a sparkling, turquoise blue. There are no facilities on the island--bathrooms and food are on the boat. A long but satisfying day.","April 20, 2014","Excellent day, long day",125,Boston,4

Arrived to explore to the fort and take photos, not having to worry about other tourist while taking photos was sweet and then having the waters to explore alone was nice. Water Temp was OK for snorkeling. Bird Island was off limits due to nesting. Plenty of fish to see at the buoys It is amazing to see and imagine how they built this place.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Trying to see all of the US National Parks and Dry Tortugas is one of the tougher ones to reach. Other family members had gone out on the boat and said it was a long, rough ride, so I checked into Key West Seaplane Adventures. Glad I did. You can go all day or half day and we decided on half day. The flight out and back was beautiful and the pilot gave us lots of information as we went.The fort was interesting to walk around on the self-tour. We also walked along the top of the fort for some super views.There's a nice sandy beach to spend some time snorkeling, swimming or sunbathing.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Yes we were given the option to get a full refund or brave the rough seas. Yes I chose to go. Yes I took Dramamine. Yes I still got seasick. Yes it was worth it. To me this was my chance to see the Dry Tortugas and check it off my bucket list. There had been a storm the night before and the seas were very rough for the last 45 minutes of the boat ride. The crew was great and prepared for a boat load of sick passengers. I did not envy their job. It is a long ride but the island is beautiful. The fort is very interesting to walk around. The seas were too rough to go swimming or snorkeling but I was told by several people that it is some of the best snorkeling in the keys. It was nice just sitting by the water watching the waves crash in. So even though we didn’t get to take full advantage of everything this trip usually has to offer I still had a very enjoyable day. You do need to set aside the whole day. You are supposed to be at the boat by 7am and it returns around 5:30pm. The boat ride is about 2.5 hours and you have about 4 hours on land. It is expensive at $170 per person for which you get the boat ride, breakfast, lunch, snorkel equipment and a guided tour of the fort. The food is so-so at best. There is a coupon code in local brochures for $10 if booked on line. I did book on line but the week before we went down so I didn’t have the code. I did get a $10 refund for having a National Parks pass. It is a unique opportunity to visit a hard to get to park and for me was worth the time, expense and queasiness.","April 18, 2014",Excellent,101,"Chicago, Illinois",5

When we got to the key, we took the tour with Jeff, who LOVES the place, and had loads of stories to tell.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Words cannot describe the sheer beauty of this place. Even if you are only in Key West for 1 day I recommend you do this, there is so much to do at the fort alone, plus you have the opportunity to snorkel, swim, or just relax on the beach. The only downside to our trip was that the boat ride there was rough, this is no ones fault, just mother nature doing her thing.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I suggest taking the sea plane if you can swing it. We've been out here three times - and love it!! Here are my tips. Bring extra water and snacks. Eat before you go and bring extra snacks - there are no concessions at the fort. Extra sunscreen is necessary, bring some towels. I prefer my own snorkel equipment and always bring my own - often I snorkel there without fins - if you wear them put the on in the shallow sand and walk backward until you can snorkel out. Don't forget your camera and bring on the is waterproof the sea life is amazing. The fort is rich in history - so take your time. You can really never see it all in one trip, so you will just have to come back. People say the ferry is great - and someday I will try it. For now, I'll stick to the plane ride over it is beyond cool.","April 16, 2014",I love this place!,10,"Marathon, Florida, United States",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I highly doubt there is anything in the US that will compare to this. This place is nice! The Yankee Freedom is run perfectly, so getting there was great (although short, if only doing a one day trip). The snorkeling there was better than anywhere I have been (Hawaii, John Pennekamp, Vieques, and Culebra); around the moat wall is great (the schools of parrotfish were awesome), but the old coal docks are even better due to the abundance of fish. We walked the fort by ourselves instead of guided to save time. I’m sure we missed great info, but it was nice to not be surrounded by people. Kayaking out there was awesome! So beautiful, especially on the north side of bird key. Camping was great because we had more time. The rats are active at night (and hermit crabs) but be smart and listen to the park ranger at the camping debriefing and you won't have any issues. I had a laptop and 4 cameras, and we left them in a backpack at several different locations and didn't have any issues with theft (I was paranoid). Fishing is awesome off the small docks by the park ranger boat, even with the old frozen bait (fish and shrimp). Just watch out for the greedy pelicans that dive bomb your bait, trying to get hooked; the giant groupers that will try to go for your fish when you are reeling him in, if he is fighting hard; and the bull shark that likes to steal bait (or so I heard from a fisherman on the Yankee freedom dock. We saw him, but he didn't care for our small bait). Take sterno to coat your charcoal in or else the fire will be hard to start. We didn’t see the crocodile, sadly. We did see a nurse shark, a sea turtle, and big barracuda while kayaking the south side of bird key. Walking the moat is awesome, especially in the evening and morning when there is more activity in the water on either side of the moat. A gopro on a gopole works awesome here. Even if you can only spend a day, it is worth the expensive trip and short time there.","April 14, 2014",Awesome doesn't even begin to describe,15,"Tyler, Texas",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Historic, natural. It's a money and time investment, but worth it. Sea plane allows you to spend more of your time on the island, but is more expensive.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped for three days, It was great, very relaxing, good snorkeling, beautiful blue-green water, interesting fort.The day tour gives you about 3 and a half hours on the island. Time for lunch on the boat-tour of the fort and a snorkel. Our trip to the island was smooth sailing, the trip back was rough with many people getting seasick.Camping is nice because we had 3+ days on the island.Some observations:I thought we would have the island to ourselves when the boat left-While it did clear out, there were 10 other campers, a 100+ foot boat with workers repairing the fort (very quiet-hardly noticed them), about 14 volunteers who camped in the group camping area, and several people who took their dingys in from one of 20+ boats anchored in the calm bay next to the island. Nobody was rude or too loud, but more people then I had hoped for.As are most reefs in the world, this one seems to be dying, a grey dust is on most of the coral. Still, healthier than most places I've been and interesting fish.Rats come out at night-I don't mind rats, my daughter has had several as pets, they did not bother us, you could hear them scurrying and see an occasional set of eyes with your flashlight.Hermit crabs... lots of them-I thought they were cool. if you dropped a speck of food or drink they crabs came out of nowhere.

We arrived on the island just after 8.45am so apart from the few campers, the nine of us on the plane had it to ourselves until the ferry arrived at 10.30.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The last time we were in the Keys our Yankee Freedom trip was canceled due to high seas and so that was a bummer. But I remember standing in line to check in and not getting food on the boat that hour we were on sea. Things have improved immensely with this operation! The check in now is reminiscent to checking in with an airline. We got out boarding passes in under 2 minutes and they have a beautiful modern waiting area. The boat trip now serves breakfast and lunch and both are buffet and excellent fresh foods and drinks. The trip is long but once you get to the Dry Tortugas you will not be disappointing. The sand is white, water clear, blues and tropical greens. There are reefs all around the fort. The fort itself is in rough shape and not sure our govt is able to provide the proper money to fix all that is deteriorating. Its a real shame! The history of the fort and the tour was very interesting and lasted almost an hour an 10 mins. And while the tour is great for the first time you are hear and learn the story of it all and the tour guide was fantastic, it did eat into too much of our free time exploring and snorkeling. By the time we did the tour and ate lunch we only had about 2.5 hours to snorkel. This is just not enough time to see as much as we wanted. But what what we did sea was amazing. The highlight that we recommend is the pilings to the left of the dock. There are many of them and here you will sell hundreds of different fish. We saw red and black grouper, yellowtail, snapper, tarpon, barracuda, and many pretty tropical's as well as bright purple fans and all sorts of pretty corals. Next time we come we will skip the tour and spend all the time exploring and snorkeling for sure. The beach is perfect white sand and the water crystal clear and a great swimming area. This trip is well worth the money and the crew is extremely friendly and helpful. The trip back, relaxing on the back deck of the boat, with a nice ocean breeze and a Corona and lime, makes for one fantastic and relaxing trip. This is one of the top 3 things you can do if you go to Key West in my opinion. Dont miss it!","April 13, 2014",Absolute Treaure in middle of nowhere,97,"Pocono Mountains Region, Pennsylvania",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"So there is no cheap way to get to the Dry Tortugas unless you have your own boat, but it's definitely a unique experience if you can afford it. My Mom and I took the Yankee Freedom III to the park. It's a 2.25 hour trip one-way so that is a lot of time on the boat, but you get a nearly equal time at the park, which is longer than the much more expensive sea plane trips I had researched).Your ticket on the Yankee Freedom also includes breakfast, lunch, and rental snorkel gear and even though it's nothing fancy at least you are getting that included with the ticket price. I would recommend sitting inside on the way to the park. There are some interesting videos that they show in preparation for arrival - plus it can be a little chilly in the morning with sea spray in your face. Save the outdoor seating for the way back - just cover up and wear lots of sunscreen - my feet actually got a lot of sun on the ride back when I forgot to put sunscreen on them (I usually wear sneakers so didn't think to cover my sandal-clad feet.)So my Mom and I got off the boat and took a guided tour of Fort Jefferson with one of the boat guides. He wasn't the best guide and I found it curious that they only did 3 tours of 25 people each, which meant there were twice as many people on the boat than were able to take a tour, but having done the tour, I would say a self-guided tour would have been just as good. So don't fret if the tour fills before you can sign up (which is done once aboard the boat). A number of people, especially those with kids, went right to the beach for swimming and snorkeling. We were able to take the tour of the fort, walk around the top of it, visit the gift shop for a few souvenirs, walk around the moat, and spend about 30 minutes in the water before having to get back on the boat. Obviously, you can prioritize your own time and while I would have liked maybe 1 more hour, I was able to do everything I wanted (plus it was nice to get back to Key West around 5:15 pm). If anything, I wish the boat could travel faster to reduce travel time.Visiting the Dry Tortugas is an all day affair, but it is such a unique experience that I would recommend it if you can afford it. If you spend any time in Key West, you will quickly learn that quite a lot of fort building went on in the Civil War era, but in Key West none of the forts were completed, which I found pretty funny. My only regret is that I never actually saw any ""tortugas,"" which I really would have loved to see.","April 13, 2014",Expensive Day Trip - But Worth It If You Can,66,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My wife and hire elected a full day trip on a float plane to Fort Jefferson National Monument in the Dry Tortugas. The flight was fantastic with views of interesting things from ship wrecks to private islands. After a smooth landing alongside Ft. Jefferson, we taxied to the beach, unloaded our gear for the day and headed to the beach for snorkeling. Clear water and calm conditions provided us with some amazing underwater views. In the afternoon, the breeze picked up so we headed into the fort to see the exhibits and take a ranger led tour.Fort Jefferson is unique in it's history from Spanish holdings, through the U.S. Civil war and beyond. The day we were there two small boats were on the beach as two groups of Cuban refugees had landed on US soil. So this small group of islands still has a strategic location for many.One can take a ferry, float plane or simple sail there themselves as it isn't much more than about 70 miles north by west of Key West. There are no facilities here, including fresh water so bring anything you need for the day and experience one of the most unique historic sites in the world.","April 13, 2014",Great Day trip whilst in Key West,29,"Cape Coral, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped on the Dry Tortugas for 2 nights in February. There are various ways to get to the island, but the cheapest and most efficient way for campers to visit is by using the Yankee Freedom ferry. As campers we were required to arrive 30 minutes earlier than anyone else. We decided to come an entire hour early to avoid a log jam with other campers. We parked at the end of the street and unloaded our gear. There were various push carts around which allowed us to easily transport everything. After unloading everything, we dropped the car off in a parking deck a block away for $13 a day. Being early there were no lines to check-in. The captain gave us a rundown on what to expect and then we waited around for the boat to leave. On the ride over there are air conditioned areas below and on top of the boat. These rooms have tables which are convenient for eating breakfast. There are also outside seats on the top deck. All these seats, except the row closest to the room are baking in the sun the entire time. Breakfast was simple (hard boiled eggs, yogurt, juice, milk, ham, bread, jam and cereal). The ride takes a couple of hours and there isn't a whole lot to see. Most people piled off the boat as soon as we arrived, but as campers we were asked to stay behind and listen to a speech from the park ranger. After a 5 minute rundown, we were released with our gear waiting on the dock. I would walk right past your gear and head straight to the campsite. There are limited shady spots to pitch a tent so try to have one person in your group secure a spot and then go back to get your gear. After pitching your tent and paying your camping fees ($3/person/night), I'd recommend grabbing lunch on the boat. The lunch is pretty good. It is all you can eat cold cuts, with decent sandwich fixings. There is also a pretty tasty tuna salad and potato salad. After lunch we decided to snorkel. The equipment the boat provides is decent, but if you have your own gear I'd recommend that instead. You do get to keep the gear the entire time you are camping. We decided to snorkel around the moat the first day. There were some great coral fans and several species of fish. We also spent some time around the South coaling pylons. There you will find great schools of fish. After spending over 90 minutes in the water we went back to the boat where we were able to shower. With no water on the island, these WARM showers on the boat were great. Every day while camping we would spend the mornings getting dirty and then come back to the boat before 2:45 to take a shower and be clean for the evening activities. At 3:00 the boat and throngs of people leave and the island becomes a tranquil island paradise.The afternoon and early morning are great times to explore the inside of the fort. You feel like you are the only person in there at times. There is a small visitor's center with some nice reference materials including a great 3-D video. As of February they were working on restoring the final exterior wall and also doing some internal work. I'm not sure when they were planning on completing the work. The fort is so big that you can find plenty of great areas away from the construction. For dinner there are plenty of available grills. Once night sets in there is a great starry sky.The ferry allows up to 3 kayaks on a trip. We ended up renting two from their recommended vendor. For $160 the kayak vendor provided all the necessary gear (life jackets, marine radio, dive flag, anchor, rope, dry bags, first aid kit, cooler, etc.) The crew loads everything for you. If the conditions are right, I highly recommend a kayak rental. It allows you to explore several areas around the park which most people will never visit. Once you are on the island you need to submit a boat plan and I recommend doing this as soon as possible. We waited until the 2nd day when we were first going to use the kayaks and it ended up slowing us down by 45 min as we tracked down a park ranger early in the morning.With the kayaks we were able to explore Loggerhead Key which was 3 miles to the west of Garden Key. Over there we found a deserted island and some great coral heads. We also used the kayaks to cruise near Bush key where there are thousands upon thousands of sooty terns nesting. It is quite the site to see and experience.Leave your kayak on Dinghy beach and leave it above the sign. There are high tides which will wash a kayak to sea if you leave it too close to the water. Also bring your paddles to your campsite, because day trippers are known to accidentally jump in a sitting kayak assuming they are free to use for anyone.There is a salt water crocodile that lives in the moat. He apparently got swept there by a hurricane several years ago. There is a little foot bridge on the right side of the fort where it apparently likes to hang out. We were lucky enough to see it one night at sunset.I highly recommend the camping. If you only go for the day trip, the island visit is probably only a 3 stars because of the crowds and short time there, but spending the night there is easily a 5 star experience.","April 11, 2014",Should be on everyone's camping bucket list,91,Florida,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"After traveling to Key West for over 20 years, we finally took the Yankee Freedom to the Dry Tortugas. I am sorry we waited so long! As others have said the trip is amazing. Snorkeling and touring the fort grounds fills up your day, and before you know it you're on your way back to Key West. The crew is very friendly and professional, the ship is one of the cleanest and well kept ferry's that I have been on. Even the bathrooms (4) are kept clean and as fresh as can be expected for a boat that size. There are changing stations are available at the park (clean also!) and warm fresh water showers on the boat is a plus. A small gift shop and visitor center is at the park.Breakfast and lunch ware both very nice, something for everyone. Bottled water, soda, and juices are available. The cash bar opens at 2:00, and again prompt friendly service (prices are from $4-$6, beer, wine, mixed and frozen drinks). At check in, the crew updates the weather conditions and briefly goes over a few thing. They do offer Dramamine ($1) for those who think they may need it. You are also given a little Gazette with some brief history of the island.We had perfect weather, the ride back was a little rougher than the ride out, but still not bad given the size of the ferry. The ride is about 2 1/2 hours each way. A great trip.","April 8, 2014",Top of our List,68,"In the Country, NY",5

Lunch was served on the boat and was included in the trip.When we arrived we were given options to snorkel to observe tropical wildlife, lie on the beach to soak up the sun or take a historical, informative tour of Fort Jefferson. We chose the latter and were thrilled....lots of info concerning the projected purpose of the unfinished U.S. Government project gave roots to the concept of wasteful government spending.An interesting fact was the empathy that the visitors felt toward the soldiers endured wearing woolen uniform during the KW summers in a military fort with no air circulation due poor design.The entire trip was a complete success.

I guess, in a nutshell, words just cannot express the amount of beauty, history, and how unique the setting is…we did a tour, ate a very large lunch on the boat, and snorkeled in the shadow of this great fortress.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were fortunate enough to spend three nights at Dry Tortugas late March. It's no small feat to manage the logistics connected to camping 70 miles from civilization on a small island in the Gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately, we had quite a bit of wind while we were there, but the beach nearest the camp sites provided sufficient protection from the wind for us to spend most of our time in that part of the park. The rest of the park outside of the fort really wasn't accessible to us since the wind was upwards of 20 mph on the windward side of the island. As many state, the island seems busy when the ferry is docked and the plane passengers have disembarked. It's debatable whether the trip out is worth the price of passage if the weather isn't exceptionally good--it just seemed like the round trip boat ride and associated cost didn't add up if time spent on the island (about 4 hours) wasn't super charged with good weather. I did see lots of birders, but I can't say I understood the draw since most of the birds are quite a distance from Garden Key. So, be prepared to do your bird watching from a distance using your binoculars or telescope. Let me offer a few tips for campers. 1. Our sterno stove seemed incapable of doing much beyond allowing us to dip some of our charcoal in the sterno to help improve our BBQ. 2. It can get hot. We brought a Sports Brella and it was worth its weight in gold when we needed protection from the sun or wind. Keep in mind there really aren't a lot of trees on the island. 3. The fishing was fantastic, but make sure you do some reading and come geared up. I caught numerous Mangrove Snapper from the dock, but lost a lot of other fish that were quite large as my gear tapped out at 30 lb test. Fish didn't seem interested in my lures, but were crazy for my live bait. You can purchase frozen sardines at Publix in Key West--they seemed to love those and the price was decent. 4. Bull sharks. We were chumming at night in the hope we would see a nurse shark near the dock area. Low and behold, a really large bull shark swam right below us. Holy smokes. That reminds me...yes, the salt-water crockodile is real. We saw him late one night (simply take a strong flashlight and shine it into the moat as your walking until you see his eye reflect back at you). The next day, we walked over to observe him. He was sunning on some rocks in the moat, jumped down, swam in a few circles in front of us, then swam out to see for some time presumably looking for his lunch. We were assured that he was harmless, but I kept imagining someone snorkeling right into this creature and soiling their shorts. 5. Don't forget to bring stakes and appropriate equipment if it's windy and rainy. Some campers were ill-prepared for the weather--it can change rapidly in the spring. And definitely bring some warm clothing as it can also get cold--even if weather.com suggests otherwise. 6. When you first arrive on the island, I would suggest sending someone from your party over to the campsites so you can pick the best one--grab something with some shelter from the sun and wind. 7. The rangers are really helpful and are your best resource while there. Make friends with them--I'm imagining they enjoy the time with guests--and also seek out the other campers while there. You'll find some of your new neighbors need help or will make your trip more enjoyable with their company. That was the case for us. 8. The fort is worth the tour. it's very historical and interesting in all respects. 9. You can always leave behind any extra water, so bring what the park suggests. Ice is $7 per bag off the ferry (ouch), so do our best to stock up before you leave Key West. 10. Unwind, relax and enjoy. The trip is really about getting off the grid for a few days. Do your planning before you arrive (like meal choices) so you can relax as much as possible while there.","April 4, 2014",Worth the journey + some camping tips,47,"Portland, Maine",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Contemplated boat or plane the first few days of our trip. Luckily we called because the only available seats for our family of 5 was on our last full day. They were 2-3 days booked out. I read many of the other reviews that said the seaplane was worth the extra money. I bit the bullet, booked it, and it definitely was the highlight of our trip and worth every penny... The ride was fun and filled with amazing views the entire 40 min ride! From the plane we saw sharks, turtles, rays, shipwrecks, and beautifully colored water. The snorkeling was the best in all we did around Key West. We also took the first flight out at 8am and it was a great choice because there was nobody at the fort except a few campers and the handful of workers. We felt like we were on our own deserted island.The 1/2 day trip was fast... about 45 mins to see the fort and a biy over an hour yo snorkel. We felt like another hour would've given us a ""not so rushed"" feeling to sit and chill on the beach for food and drinks. We didn't want to spend the money for a full day trip. But if you got it, you may consider a full day. Bring food and they'll pack coolers for you! Also, our pilot John, was a great guide on the plane for us describing everything we flew over. He even was able to fix one of the snorkel masks that was busted... so check your gear before you leave the airport.Thanks to the National Parks Service for a wonderful historic monument and experience. We had a great visit and would definitely do it again!","April 4, 2014",Dry Tortugas by Seaplane!,5,"Whitefish, Montana",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Being a birder, the Dry Tortugas National Park has been on my bucket list, and my recent visit certainly didn't disappoint. From a birding standpoint, seeing the hundreds of nesting Sooty Terns and Brown Noddies was special, and even though it wasn't yet peak migration, there were a fair number of other species including some not seen on the mainland. With an adult fee of $170 it's not cheap, but a bargain for what you get when compared to other day-long activities. The included breakfast is available soon after sailing (hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, cheeses, bagels, fruit, etc.). Lunch is served between 11:00 and 1:00 after docking (fixings for sandwiches, chips, cookies, drinks), and later on the ride back drinks and snacks are for purchase. The ride out on the Yankee Freedom III catamaran can be rough and it certainly was the day I went. Everyone was forewarned and Dramamine was made available for $1 prior to departure and it is best taken before embarking. Still, there were a fair number of passengers who were ill, so plan accordingly. With an afternoon shift in the wind the coming back was easier. The crew is outstanding, and for those not into the birds, Fort Jefferson is something to see with guided tours included. Snorkeling equipment is provided for those inclined to explore the coral reefs. It's easy to see why this is the top-rated Key West attraction.","April 4, 2014",A super experience,82,"Newbury, Massachusetts",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Thanks to Trip Advisor my hubby and I found this fantastic tour. It was our favorite thing that we did while being in the keys for 7 days. The best advice I can share is to check out the weather, esp. the wind, before you plan your trip. Try to pick a day that is not too hot (for when you are actually on the island touring the fort) and definitely not too windy (for the ferry ride). We did this and had a perfect trip. They do not overpack the ferry with people and there are many places to sit and enjoy the outside (sun to your back if you wish) and inside (a dizzier ride). The only person we saw that got sea sick was a kid who stayed inside with her parents. It is true what they say--stay outside in the fresh air, look at the horizon, and we dicovered that if you do not get up to move around you will probably not get sea sick. Even though the boat ride was fairly smooth the day we went, you still feel like you are drunk if you get out of your seat to move around on the boat. Make sure you pack sunscreen, a hat or visor, sunglasses, dry clothes if you plan on snorkeling, and a hoodie/jacket. People who were wet or didn't have a jacket were cold on the way back (2:45-5:15). Sign up for the fort tour while on the ferry when they tell you that the sign-up sheets are available. They take 25 in a group and the groups all tour at the same time. That day there were 3 groups. If you don't take the tour, you are missing the whole purpose of being out in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Many snorklers didn't tour the fort with a guide. We feel they really missed a great history lesson. The breakfast provided was offered soon after you board. We ate before we got into open water so we could stay outside without much movement. It was a good meal with many choices including boiled eggs, ham, cheese, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, bagels, milk, juice, and coffee. Water was always available for free. After the fort tour, we came back to the boat to eat lunch. The tour was about an hour so it was a good break before we walked around the moat wall and top of the fort on our own. Lunch included, ham, turkey, cheese slices, bread for sandwiches, potato and tuna salads, fresh fruit, pop, potato chips and cookies. It was plenty to eat. You can take your lunch onto the island to eat (There is only one picnic table in the shade. All others are in the sun.) or stay on the ferry where it is a lot more comfortable. Beware, the ferry still moves even though it is tied to a dock. Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor. To stay in the shade after lunch, we laid/sat on benches inside the fort that were under some trees. The beaches were gorgeous but hot! On the ferry ride back, we enjoyed alcoholic beverages which were reasonably priced. They also have pop, candy bars, and chips for sale. You will not go hungry.","April 4, 2014",Worth the Whole Day Trip,39,"North Canton, Ohio",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is one of the least visited of the National Parks, but one that should not be missed! It is an independent park but under the aegis of the Everglades National Park Service. The seven Dry Tortuga Keys lie around 68 miles west of Key West and can be reached by private boat, air, or the Yankee Freedom III catamaran. The trip on this neat little “ferry” (reservations in advance) takes about 2 ½ hours through the Straits of Florida. Places can be quite bumpy and windy, but they do sell seasickness medication. Fort Jefferson is a major attraction on the Dry Tortugas. It is one of the major forts around the east and southern coasts of the United States that were once used for our defense. It is unlike any other fort that we have seen. Once at Garden Key you can walk around, scuba or snorkel (too much wind when we went), tour Fort Jefferson on your own, or take the tour included on your fee you paid on the Yankee Freedom III. We took the included tour with our guide Michael and where thrilled with the history and knowledge that is involved here. Fort Jefferson was once used as a prison where Dr. Samuel Mudd, who set the leg of John Wilkes Booth, was imprisoned. The trip out and back takes a day with two meals and video entertainment included with the catamaran ticket. It is well worth the time spent whether you enjoy history, water activities, or just sitting on a rock contemplating the beauty of the sea and the grace of the Frigate Birds.","April 3, 2014",Unique Tour and Fort!,176,Illinois,5

Jeff is very knowledgable and passionate about fort Jefferson and the National Park. Jeff's one hour tour is not enough to see the entire fort so touring the fort at your own pace is advised.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you are in Key West for more than a few days and want a day away from conventional crowds and activities this is a great option. This is a National Park, accessible only by boat, and includes a historical interpretation. We began with an early morning on a very large ferry moving across south and west from Key West. The ride was just long enough to feel that we were going to a relatively remote location. Upon arrival it was apparent that Fort Jefferson dominated almost the entire island. We do recommend the park ranger narrated tour, and perhaps a little history research before you go. It is like visiting a huge Roman ruin on a Caribbean island.

They provide you with breakfast on the way out and lunch when you are there. Bathrooms are aboard the ferry which are available for you to use.If you're going to snorkel go along the moat wall and swim out a bit till there is a ledge. This is where you'll see all the coral and tropical fish. The visibility wasn't the best cause of the wind but I did see a barracuda right in front of me and many small fish! Very cool! I give the island 5 stars. But if I was to rate the ferry ride it'd be a 2. People were rude on the boat hogging seats when they told you not to..The water was very choppy on the way back and people were up walking around during rough seas and falling. They were sea sick left and right...not a pleasant site. Next time we go out we'll take the sea plane to avoid the crowd.

Not sure feeding us a big breakfast prior to a 2 hour boat ride is the best idea, as an hour into the trip most of the passengers were vomiting. The seas weren't even rough, so plan accordingly. It rained the day before our trip, but the waters looked clear and amazing from the boat. We were fitted with good quality snorkel gear and headed to the north beach. It's safe to just claim a beach spot and leave your belongings for the day, as you come and go from the fort and in and out of the water. Unfortunately, we should have waited one more day because once in the beautiful blue water the visibility underneath was murky. It was disappointing; however, we ventured on and snorkeled for several hours, just making the best of it, but knowing we were missing out on seeing the beautiful fish beneath us. They serve an awesome big lunch early enough for everyone's stomach to settle before heading back on the 2 hour boat ride. Take your own water bottles, take Dramamine, a few snacks, a book, cards, etc. Our boat ride flew by, but other people got a bit restless because for the majority of the boat ride you are simply surrounded by water with no way to gauge the distance traveled.","March 22, 2014",Amazing Excursion - Worth Every Penny,9,"Wichita, Kansas",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,Ferry trip (4 hours each way) on high speed catamaran was very comfortable with breakfast and lunch. The only man made feature on the island was a civil war fort which is interesting but the main attraction for us was the crystal clear water. Snorkelling is a must do activity. ,"March 22, 2014",Unmissable if you have a spare day in Key West,6,"Milnthorpe, United Kingdom",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I'm sure that this place would have been incredible if it weren't for the 20 mph winds that stirred up the sea bed and made the water visibility about 2 feet. The purpose of this review is to warn you to always check the weather before the trip and don't be afraid to cancel. We flew out on the sea plane, that was fun but the half day trip was actually too short.","March 21, 2014",Depends on the weather,9,"Provo, Utah",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,We took the Freedom Ferry 3 out on St. Patrick's Day. It was a rough ride out to the Dry Tortugas as it was during a full moon. Many people on the boat were vomiting. I think the staff could have done a better job of warning the passengers. People (including myself) forgot about the boat upon arrival due to the beautiful scenery. The water is one of the clearest water I have ever experienced. Make sure you take good walking shoes as you want to walk around on top and bottom of the fort. The food was great (especially the potato salad). After 2 pm alcoholic beverages are available for purchase. The staff is very kind as they walk around during the 2 1/2 hour boat ride asking if you need anything. This is definitely an adventure you need to place on your bucket list. ,"March 20, 2014",Beautiful and rich in history,4,"Indianapolis, In",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,Beautiful and rich with history. We went snorkeling around the Fort Jefferson and then walked inside of the fort. Boat is the way to go~we enjoyed talking to everyone we met.,"March 19, 2014",Amazing!,1,"Austin, Texas",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"The fort is amazing to see. 16 million bricks and it was never fully completed. The highlight of this trip is the crystal blue warm waters and snorkeling.It is like being on a deserted island.If you can take the seaplane there but if not, the ferry is a great alternative. We were able to arrive before the ferry so we had the island to ourselves as the plane only holds 10 people. Well worth spending the day if you're into snorkeling and just relaxing!","March 19, 2014",So tranquil and beautiful,66,"Reading, Pennsylvania",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,My husband and I took the ferry trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park and it was well worth the money. Limited # of people allowed so please make reservations in advance. Well maintained and the tour of the Fort was very informative. Snorkeling was top notch. Don't miss this on you trip to Key West,"March 19, 2014",Just Beautiful,14,"Dudley, Massachusetts",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We hopped over on a Sea Plane as we were very limited on time. The 4 hours, got us there and back and gave us over 2 hours to discover the fort. The water is so very clear, we have great pictures of water life from walking the walk around the moat. If you want to swim or snorkel you would really need to plan on it being a whole day trip. The best advice I can give, if you opt for the Sea Plane, take the 8 am plane over - you will have the park to yourselves and maybe 2 dozen others until 10:30 am. Great pictures and allows you to really enjoy the parks peace and beauty. At 10:30 -shortly before you leave if doing a 4 hour stint, the Ferry docks and the island suddenly has many more inhabitants!","March 18, 2014",Well Worth the time & money,47,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I went on the Yankee Freedom ferry to the Dry Tortugas National Park and truly enjoyed the beautiful setting of being on a remote island dominated by Fort Jefferson. The staff on the ferry was great and the food was surprisingly good if not fancy. We had not planned on going there when we set up our Key West vacation. In fact we didn't know it existed. But after hearing some great things about the trip we signed up to go the following day. What we didn't realize though is that good weather is absolutely critical. The day of our trip was extremely windy. My wife is deathly afraid of seasickness and panicked. To their credit the ferry company refunded her fare even though the policy requires cancelation by 3:00 pm the day before. In retrospect I think they knew this was going to be an especially rough ride. At my wife's insistence I went alone promising a complete report. The ride was easily the roughest boat ride I have ever experienced. At least half of the passengers got seasick. The crew however was extremely accommodating. The fort was fantastic and I really enjoyed the beautiful sunshine and peacefulness. However because of the windy conditions there was no viable snorkeling as there was only a foot or so of underwater visibility. Also as an avid birder I was looking forward to exploring the areas away from the fort that supplies the bird habitat. Unfortunately the area was completely closed for research. This is a fact I would have appreciated knowing in advance. In short, this is a great trip in good weather. If there is any sign of rain or wind do NOT go. Also I would check in advance to see that all areas are open. ","March 17, 2014",Great trip but check the weather,2,"Cleveland, Ohio",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We decided to take a seaplane out to Dry Tortugas. We were not really interested in the snorkeling as much as seeing the fort and lighthouse. Because we did the half-day trip, we had plenty of time to take a complete tour of the fort and visitors' center. We also completely circled the fort on the moat where saw numerous tropical fish. The ride out and back withour pilot were very interesting and informative. We especially enjoyed the fly-over of the abandon boats that Cuban refugees had used to escape to the US.","March 17, 2014",Great experience,76,"Monroeville, Alabama",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Visiting the dry Tortugas National Park is well worth the cost and time. The Dry Tortugas is located 70 miles west of Key West, FL. The forest service has contracted with Yankee II ferry service. The cost includes breakfast, lunch and snorkel equipment. Fort Jefferson which is located on the island is very interesting and educational. Highly recommended to take a day to visit the National Park","March 17, 2014",Worthwhile,45,"Kaysville, Utah",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom Ferry. Wish the ride was shorter, but it is what it is. The crew was wonderful. The boat was clean and in good repair. The food was better than expected. They have a nice snorkel shack. Snorkeling along the moat wall was great, saw some large fish and colorful coral. Beach was very nice and well maintained. Fort was interesting. Enjoyed watching the sea planes come and go.","March 16, 2014",Beautiful,13,"Oxford, Mississippi",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My girlfriend and I took the ferry out to Dry Tortugas for the day. The trip out was a little bumpy going through Rebecca Channel, but once we got to the island I think everyone forgot about that. It was a beautiful day, clear skies all around, and the island was amazing. It was really something out of Pirates of the Caribbean. Perfect views of the ocean from all sides of the island, you could even get on top of the ramparts and look around, which was great because there were no guard rails or anything. The only piece of advice I would give is maybe to bring water shoes, because there were a lot of corals and rocks on the beach, there weren't any bathrooms either, but you could use the one on the boat all day. Would recommend this to anyone, really a great experience.","March 16, 2014",Unbelievable place,2,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This not NOT an inexpensive trip. Or a short one. You'll need to buy a small plane ticket, or have your own (not small) boat, or hop on the Yankee Freedom ferry. The plane is quick, a boat is slow, and the Yankee Freedom hauls butt at 27.5 knots...and STILL takes almost 2 1/2 hours to get there! It's Dry Tortugas is 70 miles west of Key West. It's OUT THERE. We took the ferry, with is about $170 for each of us. For that you get the ride out and back, some information, breakfast and lunch and snorkel gear if you want it. There's a pay bar for the ride back. The folks on the boat did a good job. Once you get there you can snorkel (it's pretty good if you go to the reef), just OK at the moat wall...although we did see a monster (six foot?) ray parked on the bottom in the sand. Cool! And/or you can explore the fort. It's a BIG fort with three levels, a lot of acreage and a lot to see. There is great signage that walks you through life at the fort and facets of the fort itself. We took our time and it took us about two hours to do it all. Well worth it. You have 3 1/2 hours on the island, so fitting in snorkeling and lunch and exploring will keep you hopping. Note: There are guided tours of the fort.l They are very good. OR you can get a self-guided book tour with is also very good, especially when combined with the signage. Note 2: Take some water with you when you're exploring the fort. They call it DRY Tortugas for a reason. Note 3: Best snorkeling is the coral reef west of the fort, about 200' from the moat wall. The next best snorkeling is among the pilings of the old wharfs. Note 4: If you want to sit in the open air on the way out to the island, go straight up top. Those seats fill up fast. They serve you breakfast and if you get it and eat it on the main indoor deck you 'll be stuck there for two hours. Grab food and head topside OR leave your partner up top and go down and one of you get breakfast for both of you. You'll likely finish it before the boat gets very far and you're set!","March 16, 2014",A Full Day But Worth It,185,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We elected to visit the dry tortugas via seaplane to avoid being seasick. The added benefits included having the area to ourselves to enjoy and having the guidance of our pilot john. He was a skilled pilot withExperience in Alaska and he explained to us what a fine plane we were in....relatively new, perfect for the winds and low altitude flying. ...and a beauty. The landing on the water was so smooth. We saw rays, sharks and turtles.

We saw parrotfish and urchins and all kind of cool creatures. I highly recommend camping. Just the day trip is really not enough time to explore the area and relax on the beautiful beach. Warning the sun is scorching. Bring an umbrella plenty of water and sunscreen. Great place for photos.","March 10, 2014",Awesome experience,30,"Stockbridge, Georgia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was a great day trip for those who want to escape the crowds. The boat was clean and the employees pleasant and well informed.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were two of the 154 people who took the Yankee Freedom III ferry ride 70 miles from Key West to Ft Jefferson on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas. We booked our tickets online months ago and it was well worth the $320. The sea was a bit choppy on out trip. The crew said the swells were on average 3 to 4 feet with some 6 footers thrown in. Unfortunately this made many people sick. The crew was constantly taking care of the little white barf bags, I think those guys are paid by the pound! Seriously, I didn't find it bad but after two hours I realized why I don't spend a lot of time on the water. Ft. Jefferson was fantastic. Our guide gave us a great talk with lots of historic information. We didn't snorkel but many others did and loved it. Several people fished and ocean kayaked. Several we're camping and we picked up a few campers who were returning to Key West. Breakfast and lunch was served on the boat. Great time. We'll worth the money to visit this special park that has been kept for us by the NPS. Thanks guys!","March 8, 2014",What a great day - tough ride out for some,178,"Galesburg, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I wouldn't do this trip when there is any danger of rough seas. Anything more than 1-2 foot seas, I might pick another day. I think this is especially true for anyone who has issues with motion sickness. You spend 5 HOURS ON THE BOAT FOR 4 HOURS ON THE ISLAND. I do think it is good day trip. The fort is quite interesting. The snorkeling was good, not world class. The boat was very good. The crew was great. There's a gal named Liz that works in the galley area that has a future in customer relations. They fed you just fine. Again, I might not go on a day with less than idea weather. The good news is that the ferry folks let you cancel up to 3pm the day before the trip. So, watch the weather carefully. One last thing- yes there is a salt water croc that calls garden key home. Apparently, it's often seen in the moat around the fort.","March 8, 2014",I wouldn't do this trip when the weather is poor.,474,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin",4

We had a nice time there and enjoyed laying on the beach and snorkeling at our leisure. The boat ride is 2 1/2 hours there and 2 1/2 back - this makes for a long day. The island is very small.

But ask about the best spots; a live, large coral reef lies 50 yars off the west side of the fort, and only 4 of us on the trip found it when a guide mentioned it. The ferry ride is 2.5 hours, short going out but long coming back. Nice narrations, good food, excellent Park Service tours of Fort Jefferson. Can shorten trip (and increase expense) with a seaplane trip to the site.","March 7, 2014",Pleasant day trip,7,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you're like most people, you're probably clueless about what and where the Dry Tortugas is/are. After our trip to Fort Jefferson/Dry Tortugas aboard the Yankee Trader, we got answers and had a fantastic time. In a nutshell: The Dry Tortugas are tiny islands that are part of the Keys and are even further away from the mainland than Key West. The main attraction is Fort Jefferson (where the ferry anchors) which totally encompasses one of the islands, leaving only a narrow swath of white sand beaches around the perimeter. The water is the clearest and warmest that I ever seen. Swimming and snorkeling were out of this world. You can camp there overnight if you go through a lot of trouble…but it's probably worth it. It's not cheap. Only one ferry boat goes out once a day. But go. It's one of those adventures that you need to take on. We ordered up our expensive ferry tickets on line to save a bit of money. Breakfast and lunch are served on board the ship and the food is fine.The snorkeling instructions and equipment are included, as is the entrance to the fort (since we hold National Park Passes, we had that amount deducted from the total charge). FYI: you can only buy Dry Tortugas t-shirts at the gift store inside the fort,so you might want to think about picking some up. Another FYI: Since my husband and I were unwilling to leave the water, we almost missed out on the lunch buffet :-(","March 6, 2014",What a Surprise!,14,Van Nuys,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,Take Yankee Freedom ferry. Spend the whole day sightseeing the fort and snorkeling on your own semi-private island out in the middle of the gulf. Cant get any better than that. Lots of migrating birds in the area and saw sea turtles on the way out to the fort. I cant believe I have never been here before. So super cool. Lots of history and the snorkeling was awesome. ,"March 6, 2014",Dont miss this!,44,washington,5

We have been a few times, but to go with your grandparents and here all the stories they shared of when they would visit when they were our age, is just memories we will treasure!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I had waited a long time for this tour, paid my $170 which included my $5 park pass and got on the Yankee Freedom 2 at 8AM and powered our way out 120Kms into the Gulf of Mexico. The fee included breakfast, lunch, and complimentary beverage. The trip took 2 and a half hours to reach our destination, and we where there for about 4 hours. On the trip over to Tortuga, all guests where privy to very informative videos on snorkeling, eg. how to fit your free supplied gear, where to snorkel, what not to do, and where to return it after use. There was a video on the history of the fort, the land, and the waters around it. Swimming is permitted to swimmers at the north and south beaches. For those who wish to get in the water, there are warm fresh water hoses on the stern of the boat to rinse the salt water off your body, and a hose on the dock to wash the sand off your feet, and change rooms on the dock. There are guided tours of the fort, or you can tour at your own leisure, the fort is in the process of being restored, so there are areas that the public has no access to, but don't worry, there is plenty of area to explore, including walking the mote wall around the outside of the fort. There are three levels of the walls to walk, observe the restored 25 ton canons, enjoy the view from the top level, stair wells are in the corners of the fort. Over night camping is also permitted, so bring a tent, if that's your fancy. There is a small gift store to purchase souvenirs on the property. On the return trip, all names of passengers are accounted for before the ferry leaves, and the bar is open for those passengers who are over 21 years of age, and have the cash to purchase beer, wine, and mixed drinks. The crew was very friendly, and informative. This is a must see tour for all ages, and I highly recommend it.","March 4, 2014",My Dry Tortuga Experiance,17,"Moose Jaw, Canada",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The best trip ever!!! Well worth every penny and much more spectacular than you can ever imagine. Both the staff at the park and the staff on the ferry (Yankee Freedom) were amazing, helpful and genuinely passionate about the place.We decided to camp here with our two young kids (ages 3 and 5) and so glad we did. I can't imagine just spending a few hours here. There is so much to see, do and take in. Besides it's only a few dollars more to stay and camp. Plus the best time on the island is after the ferry leaves and you feel like you have the whole place to yourself. We were able to enjoy four wonderful days and three peaceful nights here.It does take extra effort to camp. You must bring everything you'll need for your stay including fresh water as there is none on the island. The National Park website gives a good list of things you should bring. Here are a few necessities I would recommend in addition to or to emphasize what they list; heavy duty ground stakes, padding to sleep on (the ground is hard), tarp for under tent especially to keep rain out, a beach umbrella (little to no shade plus it also came in handy during rain), wipes, hand sanitizer, a good book (plenty of peaceful down time), towels, swimsuits, sunblock, bug repellent (others have mentioned no mosquitos but my boys and I got bites, nothing major but if you're like me who is prone to mosquito bites then it comes in handy), underwater camera, a kayak if you have one (its an extra $20 to bring on the ferry) and a beach chair would be nice. If you are worried about overpacking, we packed quite a bit considering we had two little ones to keep in mind and we had no problem with loading and unloading. The ferry has a great system for it all. Taking the plane you are much more limited to what you can bring.With all that in mind camping here is not as remote as we suspected. There is always staff on the island. Both the ferry (docked 10:30-2:45) and visitor center (opened 10-4) on the island have few things for purchase (snacks, sunblock, bug repellent, underwater cameras, etc.). There does happen to be electrical sockets on dock (away from the camping area). The ferry does serve lunch everyday from 11 am-1pm for $7 if you opt to use their services. It includes sandwiches, chips, drinks, potatoe salad and cookies. But if the weather's too bad the ferry won't come out. The ferry also has fresh, warm outdoor showers on board. The only draw back is that the ferry leaves at 2:45 pm and at that time we were still enjoying snorkeling so taking a shower was pointless.There are bathrooms on site. Surprisingly they are clean, don't smell and are equipped with hand sanitizer. If you have the opportunity to take this trip do it and if you can camp even better!","March 2, 2014",One of the best times of our lives,9,"Murree, Pakistan",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Loved the trip! Staff was wonderful, snorkeling was a blast, food was also pretty good! Bathrooms on the boat stayed clean, which was a relief (only 4 for about 170 people), and fresh water showers on the boat for after the trip. you should bring a water bottle to fill up…there's plenty of water, but they only have cups. $170 covers round trip to the beautiful national park, breakfast, lunch, water, coffee, a tour (they fill up, so when they say sign up, do it right away).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the ferry trip out to the islands, crew is great, plenty of space for everyone, good food, very relaxing trip. The island itself has fabulous waters surrounding it, crystal clear, able to see lots of fish. If you are not a snorkeler, walk along the moat and watch the edges for interesting groups of fish. The fort itself is interesting when you realize how difficult it must have been to get all the building materials to the island. Even today there were repairs going on, and we talked with some of the workers about the logistics of supplies, when you can't just run to home Depot or Lowe's. The island is kept very very clean since all trash must leave with the boats. Would do this again, altho would take the seaplane, just for the adventure of it.","March 2, 2014",fabulous day trip,28,Kansas,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"First, I am going to say that we splurged on the seaplane flight because we were only in Key West a couple days and we wanted to make the most of our time. So we had 3 hours actually at the national park, and though it would have been nice to stay longer, it was completely worth it.Our main reason for going was to see Fort Jefferson, and it was all that we expected and more - it is an amazing building with all kinds of history, and must be seen to be believed. No handrails, guard rails or anything to interrupt the enjoyment (walk around on the moat seawall - a very surreal experience!)We also spent a while on the beach (had a beer in a perfect Corona moment), swam some, and it was just beautiful - water was super clear, and perfect - diving or snorkeling would also have been great, but not really our thing.I would be tempted to go back and camp overnight if we were in the area again. We got a taste of how nice it was to be there mostly alone since we were on the last flight (arrived as the ferry was leaving). I can only imagine what the stars would look like.","March 1, 2014",You Must Go,56,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This trip was on our ""bucket list"" and was wonderful. The boat ride over was very smooth and the breakfast served was generous and varied. The water around the island is amazing aqua blue tones, absolutely gorgeous--just like in the photographs online.. We opted to take a guided tour of Fort Jefferson which, while very informative, ran a bit long. We cut out and went to get the lunch on board the boat. We had worn our swimsuits under our clothes, so after getting snorkel gear on the dock, we headed to one of the beaches. Snorkeling there was okay, but we wished we had tried it along the sea wall instead. When we walked all along the moat/sea wall later, we saw much more variety of coral and fish than we had seen at the South Beach. There are restrooms and warm fresh water showers on the boat --and changing rooms (but no restrooms) on the dock. The time on the island went very fast. We wish we could have been there another hour to poke around the fort on our own. It is very sunny but there is shade available in many locations. Be sure to wear sunscreen and a hat! While on the boat, both directions, they show films of the park, how to snorkel, and other topics related to the trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,This place was amazing. The jet express was booked so we thought our chance to visit Fort Jefferson was not going to happen. We spent a few extra bucks and took the seaplane to the Fort instead of the boat ride. Well worth the money. The snorkeling at the Fort was amazing. The boat ride was almost $200 a person and the plane ride was under $300 a person. The flight is worth it alone. We counted over 50 sea turtles on our return trip from the fort. Sharks and rays too. The plane ride was only 30 minutes compared to the 2 1/2 hour boat ride each way.,"February 28, 2014",seaplane excursion!,0,"Detroit, Michigan",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,Ft Jefferson is flooded with history. The tour is great and very informative. The beaches are clean and beautiful. The water was perfect for snorkeling and swimming. This is your destination when taking the Yankee Freedom out for the day. It's a great day excursion and well worth the money. Lunch is served on the Yankee Freedom after the tour of Ft. Jefferson. There is no fee to take the tour of Ft. Jefferson. The only fee involved is boarding the Yankee Freedom to take you out to the Dry Tortugas National Park.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I took the high speed catamaran ferry Yankee Freedom to the Dry Tortugas, and it was a highlight of our time in Key West. The boat was very comfortable (we had heard that it can get a little rough coming back, but it was basically flat the day we went) the crew was pleasant and they served a satisfying breakfast and lunch buffet style--nothing fancy, but a surprising number of choices. Fort Jefferson is amazing, and there was plenty of time to explore it thoroughly in a relaxed fashion, inside and out and up and down. They do a couple of guided tours during your time on the island. We didn't swim, but quite a few people did, and they offer free snorkeling equipment there for those who wished to use it. A number of people camped there....though you must bring everything, including your water if you do. There are no facilities of any kind for visitors to the island; you must return to the boat for everything including toilets, but the island is small enough that it doesn't seem to be an issue. We had glorious weather the day we went, and the sky and water colors were amazing, so perhaps that enhanced our impressions, but we thoroughly enjoyed our day and would recommend it to anyone.","February 26, 2014",A Highlight of our Key West trip!,13,"Montgomery County, Maryland",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I took the Yankee Freedom high speed ferry to the Dry Tortugas this past weekend. Although we were told that the check in time was between 7:00 and 7:15, the ferry didn't actually leave until about 8:00 a.m. No matter really, just that a little more sleep would have been nice! The trip to the island was very smooth. Breakfast was served promptly. No hot foods, but certainly an expanded continental breakfast. The trip took 2+ hours, but once there, we had the option of exploring Fort Jefferson on our own, or with a tour guide. We opted for the latter, but cut out after an hour. We wanted to have enough time for lunch and snorkeling. Lunch was served on the boat (sandwiches and salads). The beach was beautiful, and the water was Caribbean blue. We were both a little disappointed in the snorkeling. Maybe we just aren't experienced enough, because others were raving about the coral reef and fish. We just didn't really see anything. We were required back on the ferry at 2:45, and pulled into Key West a little after 5:00. Really glad that I did it. Probably wouldn't be on my list of things to do again.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Had a fantastic experience taking the sea plane out to Dry Tortugas National Park. You have more than enough time to explore this amazing fort and go snorkeling too. It's beautiful being out so far in the Gulf. We took the 2pm flight and when we arrived the ferry was leaving, so we had the entire park to ourselves. Looks like the endless job of trying to maintain the fort is constantly taking place. Hard to believe park rangers and workers live out there. There is NO water at the park at all but the sea plane provides you with your own cooler and 4 bottles of water. Bring your own hand sanitizer or wipes.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited the Dry Tortugas by way of Seaplane Adventures located at the Key West Airport. They provided us with soft drinks/water, a cooler, and snorkel gear. Neither my wife or I had ever been on a seaplane and since we didn't want to spend a long time getting there on the ferry boat we decided to fly out. Everyone on the flight has headphones and a window seat. We saw sea turtles, sting rays, sharks and some old shipwrecks from the air. Once at the fort, we took a self guided tour of Fort Jefferson, climbing the stairs and getting great views and photos from the top. After that we went to the south beach. The water was a bit cold so we didn't snorkel but the water was very clear and we just ""chilled"" along the beach Great time and a beautiful historic fort !","February 24, 2014",Dry Tortugas,21,Miami,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Its not easy getting to the Park. We chose to take the sea plane and highly recommend it as the best way to go. We suggest taking the afternoon flight which arrives just as the large boat from Key West leaves to you have the fort and beaches mostly to your self.The fort is an amazing edifice and made great sense as a U.S. defensive position but the fort itself is a testament to bad planning and construction. For history buffs it is fascinating. The beaches are small, pure white sand and there are a lot of birds to see. The snorkeling was interesting but do not go expecting to see a lot of coral and amazing fish. However, there is a slat water crocodile that lives in the moat around the fort and you don't see those every day.For a unique experience that most people will never have we highly recommend this trip.","February 23, 2014",Absolutely Worth The Effort,110,"Wellington, Florida",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"While I'd read the reviews, nothing could really prepared me for the beauty and tranquility of the Dry Tortugas... Especially by sea plane!!! We were scheduled to take the ferry... Cheaper and longer... But the weather was rough and rainy the few days before, so we cancelled. Then on impulse, we decided to go on our last day in Key West. We decided to go ahead and spend the extra and do the sea plane... It was so worth it!!! The trip over took 45 minutes. The plane was comfortable and I felt completely safe. It holds 10 or so passengers. The views flying over we're breathtaking. I saw turtles and sharks from the air. The colors of the water were amazing. We got to the fort around 9:00... It was so quite and peaceful... Yet so isolated! There really isn't anyone there until the ferry arrives at 10:30. A few people were previously on the island camping and it looked like a great place for families. The beaches were good for snorkeling and swimming. The fort is well preserved and is nice to tour if you're a history buff, but the trip is worth the views and the water!!!We wondered around the island until about 11:15, then jumped in the plane and headed back to Key West... Again viewing the wonderful sights and beautiful turquoise waters. All in a half a day! This is a great trip... Definitely a must see! I highly recommend... Especially by sea plane!","February 23, 2014",Bucket List - MUST DO,80,Georgetown,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visited by way of a seaplane. Neither my husband or I had ever been on one, so we decided to go this way. With an 8am flight we had the island to ourselves, since the ferry doesn't arrive til 10:30. We took a self guided tour of Fort Jefferson, climbing the stairs and getting great views from the top. The tour was only about 35 minutes, which gave us plenty of time to snorkel near the beach. The snorkeling was amazing, with clear water and lots of small fish ( mostly near the wall of the fort).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We had a great day at Dry Tortugas National Park. Granted, the weather was absolutely perfect so we really didn't have much to complain about. It was a great trip to get us out of Key West for the day. The boat ride didn't seem that long to us. The crew was very friendly and helpful and the boat made the ride very smooth even though the water seemed choppy. Breakfast and lunch was included, which was nice not to have to pay Key West prices for the day. If you are into history, the story of the fort was interesting. The snorkeling was disappointing. Not a huge variety of fish or color, but we did see a huge hermit crab. There were cocktails for sale on the way back, which also made the boat ride go by fast.","February 23, 2014",Loved this trip!,23,"Villa Park, Illinois",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I read all the reviews but still debated whether this was worth the trip. I'm not a ""fort person"". This was absolutely enchanting and such a worthwhile trip. Here are my suggestions and observations not already stated in previous reviews: TAKE THE SEAPLANE, half day trip leaving at 8am (see my review of SeaPlane Tours). You get headphones with a narrated and musical background during the captivating flight. Sights include a couple of sunken ships, islands with Cuban refugee boats, and a birds eye view of idyllic sea turtles swimming, sometimes sharks, and I saw a school of about 30 sting rays. Everyone gets a window seat, you fly at 500 ft so you can see/take excellent photos during the short flight. Just walking the fort and getting the views is enchanting. We had plenty of time to walk all through, get our photos and digest the fort and had a solid hour left for beach and snorkeling. Water gives you a chill at first but snorkeled last weekend for 30 minutes and was fine, no wet suit. Snorkel over by the pilings to the left of the fort entrance, water is warmer. Don't be afraid to venture in between the pilings because that is where the fish are. We saw 3 ft long barracuda, a dozens of other big fish, some tropical colored. Most were just ""sleeping"" in large groups and didn't spook at all when you swam by. Lots of brain corals to explore with little fishies hiding beneath. When you come up to get your bearings, look up at the pelicans who are napping on the pilings above you. Could have petted one if I tried, they are obviously used to people. We brought a baguette and some cheese (seaplane provides a medium hard sided cooler with bottled water so we threw the cheese in there) and had a nice picnic after our snorkel before heading back. Our plane left just as the ferry of 150 people arrived. We flew back, had lunch, sat on the beach in our hotel for a few hours, napped, showered and walked all the way from Flagler Beach to Mallory square...and guess who was just getting back? The ferry. Although I'm sure you get adequate wildlife sightings on the ferry ride, 5 hours of travel for the fort would not have been worth it to me. The half day morning excursion was perfect and I would do it again. Kudos to the Seaplane people for an efficient and well orchestrated experience. Highly recommend them.","February 22, 2014",Enchanting! Here's what others didn't say:,174,"Madisonville, Louisiana",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom boat trip which is an early start but you get to see so much on the way. Breakfast was filling but basic - but just what you need. The trip took about 2.5 hours but we spent most of that time on deck looking for turtles, flying fish, what you could see on the bottom of the sea floor and anything else that was passing - very pleasent. You don't see the fort until you are nearly on top of it - we thought the captain had got lost :-). The fort is very interesting and there are pleanty of things to look at and see. Take the guided tour as the guides are very knowledgable and give you far more information than you can read.Lunch was lovely - cold meats, salads and drinks and plenty of it. Then either you can swim or go back to explore the fort - there is plenty of shade under the trees to just sit and enjoy the peace. The trip back seemed so short as we were talking about everything we had seen and why it had been built in the first place? very odd. Excellent trip and you get back just in time to go to Mallory square to see the sunset.","February 21, 2014",Delightful day trip to somewhere a bit different,89,"Ferndown, United Kingdom",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"There are two ways to visit the NP, float plane, if you are short of time or a catamaran, if you want a relaxing trip. We opted for the Yankee Freedom catamaran, a 2½-3 hour relaxing cruise. The experience began with a cold buffet breakfast with enough options for everyone. There is opportunity for viewing wildlife on the way. Depending on the condition and the time of the year, the Gulf can be a bit rocky. Take meds if you are prone to sea sickness. Our trip was smooth sailing the entire way. The Dry Tortugas is more than Ft. Jefferson. Less than 1% of the park is above water. When you arrive you have the option to snorkel with supplied equipment, and/or a tour of the Fort. I was most interested in the Fort because my Great Grandfather, a drummer boy in the 46th Pennsylvania Infantry, was stationed there in 1863. We also walked around the fort’s moat. Due take time to see the free 3D video in the little museum and shop area. If you are a camper, that can also be arranged. While on the island, a cold buffet lunch is served on the catamaran between 11 and 2. At 2:30, the cash bar is open for the trip back. We had a wonderful time.","February 18, 2014",Unique Experience,201,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"My experience. I would defintely look at other options rather then theYankee Freedom III. I think you loose much of your flexibility for visiting say, Logerhead Key which has really great snorkeling. Plus the trip is really iffy for possible weather. So no flexibility there. And for me, I was miss lead by their registration personnel and it cost me a unfair amount of money.","February 18, 2014",Yankee Freedom Iii,2,,2

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the morning sea plane out and enjoyed fantastic ocean vistas! We even saw some dolphins and sea turtles in the water.We immediately went snorkeling at the South Coaling Docks once we arrived. Wow! Caribbean wildlife abounded! We felt a little rushed as we toured Fort Jefferson, and didn't even have time to enter the Visitors Center. We spent about an hour in the water snorkeling.The boat ride out gives you an hour more at Dry Tortugas, but is a full day trip. We were back on Key West by noon, and had the whole of Dry Tortugas to ourselves and a few campers from about 8:30 - 10:30 am when the boat finally arrived.Also, we had a National Parks Pass, which they photocopied at the sea plane check-in. We didn't have to pay their $5 entrance fee. The sea plane company provided us with complimentary snorkel gear and a small ice chest. We brought our own sandwiches and snacks which we placed in the ice chest.When will you ever have the opportunity to visit this place again?

The ocean is beautiful and the ride was pretty smooth, but it could be rough in bad weather, so pick a calm day if you can.The Dry Tortugas are the farthest tip of the Keys and that alone earns them ""Bucket List"" status. But, this is also one of the best places in the world for diving/snorkeling and observing wildlife. I'm a history buff so the tour of Ft. Jefferson was really fabulous. Its location has preserved it better than most other Civil War era forts. While weather and benign neglect have have caused some deterioration, it has avoided the damage and ""renovation"" by people (well intended or otherwise) that other sites have had to endure over the last 150 years.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was our anniversary gift. We have been wanting to do this for awhile. Last year it got cancelled for weather reasons, so we tried again this year. It was worth the wait, the money and definitely the experience. To go on the seaplane to the island was great, my husband got to sit on the cockpit going over and I sat coming back. What a rush!!!! it's the closest you will get to flying as a bird. You will see islands, sharks, stingrays, turtles, sunken ships, even boats left in the water by refugees trying to reach the US soils. The park was fun, we've seen many forts, but it was ok. The beach amazing a little cold but it's February and freezing in the east cost, the water was in the low 70""s, many people snorkeled we went up to our knees. We took the two o'clock tour and it was great because the ferry leaves when we arrive so we had the island to ourselves. The only negative is that their no water, the tour included a cooler with water each guest had their own cooler but their is no running water to clean up after your swim.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I camped two nights in the Dry Tortugas. Overall, it was a neat experience, but there wasn't enough to do to keep me entertained through the end of the third day.  I took the ferry out. I arrived early and went directly to the ferry to load my gear. The crew member was very friendly, gave me a brief overview of camping logistics, loaded my gear onto the ferry. The entire crew were very helpful and friendly throughout the trip.After loading gear, I had an hour to kill before boarding so I took a short walk around the marina before going to check in. At check-in, they advised that there would be rough seas for the final hour of the trip, so I bought Dramamine that the had for sale. Boarding went quickly and smoothly. There was a continental breakfast onboard. The trip out takes about three hours. A crew member told us about areas of Key West's harbor and the surrounding islands as we passed. As promised, the final hour of the trip was very rough. A lot of people got seasick. The crew was very helpful in collecting and distributing sickness bags and paper towels because it was difficult to move around with the rough seas.Upon arriving, a park ranger gave the campers a safety briefing and then we went with the woman who runs the visitor center to pick out and pay for campsites. The campsites were near a group of trees, so there was some shade. There's no water, so camper's must bring there own. There are composting toilets for use when the ferry is not at the island. The ferry has nice restrooms and outdoor hot, freshwater showers. Campers also get one day's lunch on the ship and can buy an additional lunch and drinks. So, camping didn't feel really primitive. The island does have a rat problem, so it is important to not eat in your tent and keep food on the hanging posts. The rats didn't actually bother me, although I didn't sleep as well as normal because once I knew there were rats around, every sound I heard sounded like rats gnawing at my tent.I took a self-guided tour of Fort Jefferson. The fort is large and interesting. One part of the fort is used as residences for the park employees and is closed to the public, but the rest is open to explore. There are signs pointing where to go on the self-guided tour and there are occasional informational placards telling about the various structures and fort history. There is a visitor center and store in the fort with exhibits about the fort and wildlife. It is also possible to walk around the outside of the fort on the moat wall.The weather the first and third days that I was there was too windy to really enjoy the beach and the waves were churning up enough dirt to make for poor snorkeling. On the middle day, we had pretty good weather, so I was able to do some snorkeling. The water was cold, and the snorkeling was pretty good, but there is better snorkeling in the Key Largo area.Bush Key is closed for much of the year to protect nesting birds, but it was open when I arrived. It was very nice to have it open, as walking along the beach was something to do each day. Had it been closed, there really would have not been much else to do on poorer weather days other than explore the fort. Overall, I am glad I went, but if I were doing it again, I probably would only do one night as there just wasn't enough to do. Also, if you get seasick, I would check the forecast before you go as it could be very unpleasant to have to endure a six hours of boating (two in potentially rough seas) for four hours of time on the island. Also, if you can afford it, I would suggest the plane to day-trippers as you get more time on the island and less travel time.","February 15, 2014",Neat camping experience,26,"Akron, Ohio",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Boat ride over was very rough, about half the people on board were sea sick including my husband.

( Take beach shoes as their is a lot of broken coral where you try to enter the water.) We met lots of really nice people from all over the world and really enjoyed this aspect of the trip.

Once we arrive at their office at the Key West Airport, we are given small coolers with water and soft drinks. Snorkel gear is also provided. We watch a short video about the flight and the island we are going to visit. John is our pilot. We board the plane that holds 10 passengers plus the pilot. Seats are unassigned but it is suggested that you sit in the same seat on the return flight to allow everyone the opportunity to see the scenery from both sides. While boarding the seaplane, a taller person may need to watch their head as they walk down the short aisle to take a seat. Every passenger has a window seat and wears a headset to hear music and narration. It is a scenic 40 minute flight to Garden Key where Fort Jefferson is located. During the low altitude flight (about 500 feet), John provides us with information about the land and sea we are seeing. When we arrive at Garden Key, John circles the seaplane around Fort Jefferson so everyone can see an outstanding aerial view of it. Then he maneuvers the seaplane to the beach so we do not get our feet wet when stepping from the seaplane onto the island. We have 2.5 hours on our own to do what we want and at the pace we want to do it. An added bonus - the ferry is leaving the island when we arrive so the crowds are gone. The Dry Tortugas are rich in natural beauty and history.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is the latest upgrade to a fantastic vessel and crew. The three-hour ship ride to The Dry Tortugas National Park was made even more enjoyable by the latest in the line of the Yankee Freedom. It is a two level catamaran that is supported by an outstanding and dedicated staff of employees. A nutritious breakfast is served on the main deck, food that is included in the rather expensive cost of the tour. After reaching Fort Jefferson and spending an hour or so on either a guided tour staffed by one of the knowledgeable employees, a filling nutritious lunch is served, again on the main deck. Again, there is no additional charge for either the tour or the lunch. The visitors on board then are able to get snorkeling gear, again without charge, to enjoy a delightful undersea tour with all sorts of denizens at a private beach. On the return to Key West, beer is available for a small fee, while bottled water and soft drinks are free.I am positive that this will be the most memorable activity during your visit to the American Tropical Island of Key West, Florida. I lived in Key West for seven years during the 1970s and still have been unable to find any more enjoyable activity.

The boat was extremely clean, well maintained, and the staff was wonderful, very cheerful, and extremely helpful. They provided a self service, all you can eat breakfast - Cheerios, bagels, orange juice, milk, coffee, tea, yogurt, ham, chucks of cheese, jelly, grapes, and cream cheese.The boat ride was 2 1/2 hours. Once at Fort Jefferson dock, free 1 hour tours were offered of the fort. Our guide was Jeff. He did a magnificent job, very knowledgeable, and kept us entertained the whole time. Once this tour was over, the boat provided a included self service, all you can eat lunch - breads, ham and turkey sliced meat, tuna salad, cheese slices, potato salad, watermelon, cookies, water, and sodas. After lunch we went snorkeling using the free boat provided snorkel masks and flippers. The sea state conditions were great and we saw lots of marine life.The boat ride back to Key West was uneventful.

The snorkeling is great, go to the area where the old pier use to be located, saw the largest mangrove snappers I have ever seen.

We have snorkeled quite a bit around North America and this was some of the coolest coral we have ever seen. The fish were so-so... But there were lots of barracuda that were fun to swim with. To be honest the flight is the highlight. We saw lots of bull sharks, turtles, a couple dolphins and lots of rays. If you can afford it. Fly. Also a good tip - Go first flight out. You will feel as though you are almost the only people there. The ferry is crowded and when it shows up the place is definitely more crowded but if you fly out first thing almost your entire time there will be peaceful. When the ferry is there you can use its restrooms and bar if you want. ","February 6, 2014",Float Plane Trip,15,"Lafayette, Indiana",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Ok, the trip to Dry Tortugas was very expensive - $329 for two of us. But, until we got to Key West, I never even knew it existed, so I had to see it. The trip takes two and a half hours each way. The boat is very comfortable, so traveling is not a problem. If you don't love just soaking up the sun and ocean breeze, then bring a book or your iPod for diversion. A lot of people slept, which just baffles me. We skipped the guided tour and explored on our own because there are very informative videos playing during the trip and the guide provides additional information. There is also printed material available to read all about the fort's history. If you climb the stone spiral staircases to the top of the fort you can walk about half way around it. The vistas are overwhelmingly beautiful with blue and turquoise waters. Just awesome. If you choose to snorkel, my advice would be to do it on the south beach and not worry about the north beach. The waves are stronger on the north side which stirs up the sand and makes viewing and swimming difficult. Time there is a little short by the time you climb around the fort and have lunch, so the south offers a much better view of fish and coral than the other side. There is no food or water available and no bathroom facilites on the island. The breakfast and lunch provided by the tour company was really very good and the food plentiful, so the only thing you might want to bring is some water. Adequate facilites are on the boat, so no worries there. All around, if you go to Key West, don't miss this opportunity to go just because of the price. You may never go back, and it is definietly one of the most unique National Parks in the US.","February 6, 2014",Don't miss it,8,"Saint Charles, Missouri",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Such a wonderful day! We took the Yankee Freedom catamaran from Key West to the Dry Tortugas' Fort Jefferson. Although the crew warned we might experience some waves, the 2.5 hour trip was smooth and uneventful. The sun and temps were perfect! The crew and staff clearly enjoy their jobs and take pride in customer satisfaction, safety and informing their passengers of the history and opportunities to enjoy oneself at Fort Jefferson. From the breakfast and lunch aboard the Yankee Freedom, to the tour guides inside the fort, to the delightful sail back to Key West, the day was perfect. The history of this fort is quite interesting and worth greater research upon returning to the mainland. . While the fish did not cooperate by joining us while we were snorkeling, the beautiful water and the opportunity to snorkel in the shadow of Fort Jefferson was outstanding. Recommend taking some drinking water with you before you leave Key West as there are no water fountains on the island. And, while there are no restroom facilities on the island, the Yankee Freedom is but a stones throw from the fort and has ample restroom facilities. Lots of walking involved, as well as stairs if one wants to get the full appreciation of Fort Jefferson. Likely not a great trip for children as well as folks who might get sea sick. Well worth the price for this amazing opportunity to visit a wonderful National Park located in the Florida keys! Go! And, be grateful we have a National Park Service!

They provide meals on board as well as snorkeling equipment. Once we arrived, we had three opportunities to tour the fort plus private time to explore and snorkel.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My family and I greatly enjoyed our trip to Dry Tortugas National Park. The all day excursion was a great adventure for us all. You probably want to limit the visit to children ages 10 and older because of the lengthy (and potentially choppy) boat ride. Be prepared for motion sickness just in case...Also, there is no water on the island; so, you need to take what you intend to consume (carry in/carryout).The fort ruins tour was extremely interesting - helps one understand the historic importance of the Florida Straits. There was a great mix of historic, ecological and scenic attractions. And the remoteness of the park makes it a special place to visit. Our visit coincided with numerous national park rangers gathering at the park for some ongoing studies, so we had some unique presentations not normally available. The gulf chop at the end of the day got a little old since some of other attendees were struggling with motion sickness (our family fared well.) We were very fortunate that our day went smoothly.We were there in April, so were not really interested in snorkeling although the water is beautiful.Bottom line - if you're in the Keys for several days and like adventurous tours, I recommend it.","February 3, 2014",Unique and Rewarding National Park Attractions,173,"Fernandina Beach, Florida",4

We snorkeled around the fort wall on the south side as well as the south side piers, which was quite good - lots of fish to see.A walk around the top of the fort was also worthwhile.The seaplane ride was over $600 for both of us, so a little pricy.","February 2, 2014",Worth the trip,4,"Winnipeg, Canada",4

It looks fantastic from the air but on the ground it's not that interesting, a large crumbling brick structure and no facilities on site. The best part is the snorkelling if you want to go into the water there are plenty of tropical fish to be seen. On land there are plenty of flesh eating gnats so prepare by using mosquito repellant. The flight back is great, you can see turtles swimming in the ocean as well as a few wrecked ships and the odd shark.

You can take a seaplane for some extra money, and it is worth every penny. The plane ride was a Blast. The rock is a bit boring. It was used as a Prison and you can see why. The sea is often too churned up to snorkel and the waters are frequently filled with jelly fish. You can camp over night there . . . did I mention that the place is infested with starving rats. Big Rats! They will eat through your tent to get at your food so you have to lock it up in a box. If you are so adventurous. You should have seen my wife's face when I suggested (not) that we camp! One more thing. I could not believe that they let the general public climb around on top of that fort with no railing. You fall, and it is 50 feet down to the brick . . . death. Watch your children. That said, we had a very fun trip and enjoyed walking around the fort and seeing the unbelievably giant guns. We did not see any rats, only their evidence. Take the Seaplane if you go.

The weather could not have been better - warm gentle breezes with temperatures in the 70s - not bad for a day in late January - and the most beautiful water on the planet. The crew of the Yankee Freedom was knowledgeable and seemed eager to do whatever they could to ensure a pleasant trip.

We enjoyed being on our own to tour. The park has a nice changing area to change into swimming gear. I did snorkel off the beach. Because of high winds the previous two days, there was a lot of sediment floating in the water, but I still found calmer areas and saw lots of fish, sea fans, and coral.

There is only one ferry boat that goes out there. It's a nice ride and they serve breakfast and lunch as part of the price, and also provide snorkeling equipment. It sounded pretty interesting so we splurged on a day at the Tortugas. Unfortunately, you can't count on the weather. So although it warm and sunny, winds had kicked up the surf pretty hard from mid-day on. Some snorkeling areas were rough for swimming and in others the waters were obscured with all the sand kicked up by wave action. And on the two-hour trip back, the sea got quite rough with several people getting very sea-sick.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"A great 3 night camping adventure that I made with my wife and 2 kids under 3. We arrived in Key West to load our gear on the Yankee Freedom Ferry. The vessel is new and the crew is better than fantastic. Food great, service wonderful.Once on the island we got a camp site and set up. It was January 2014 and it was windy and a little cold. Slight sprinkle on and off for the first 2 days. Day 3 was sunny so we hit the beach and swam a little. Water was 72 which is a little chilly.The worst part of the trip was the woman who worked in the bookstore. She is a volunteer who actually pays the National Park Service room and board to work there. Needless to say she had something to say about almost everything we did. I mean I know there is rules to be followed but the Rangers never bothered us and were very nice. She was the only thorn in the side of an otherwise perfect trip.A couple things I would like to point out. I had wanted to bring a Tandem Kayak that was 16.5 feet. But on the Ferry website it says 15.5 is the longest allowed. I asked the deck hand about the length requirement and he said that the old ferry was smaller so they had to limit the length. So It no longer applies. So bring your tandem boat with no fear, they really do not care.Next they say to carry 1 gallon per day per person. I did this and used all but 3 gallons. But I wasted much of it washing dishes. The reason I wasted it it was because I was aware that everyday some new campers leave and seem to always have left over water. So you could splurge usage. I had planned on washing all my dishes in salt water then just rinsing them in fresh.The big golden nugget is that the ferry has 3 hot showers on the fantail of the boat! The website fails to mention that little tidbit of info. So as long as the boat shows up everyday at 1030 am you can take a steamy hot shower anytime from 1030 am to 245 pm everyday! Nice!I brought too much food. But with toddlers the last thing I wanted to do was not have something for them to eat. So plan your meals and remember there is nothing besides snorkeling that causes too much exertion so plan accordingly.As far as charging electronics, there are 4 outlets at the boat house that are available 24 hours a day. So you don't have to lug extra batteries if you don't want to. I did not find out about these until the 3rd day by accident. The ferry also has outlets 1030 to 245 everyday they show up. One could also probably scrounge up more outlets inside the fort walls and other areas.Even with Book Store Nazi and the less than desirable weather we will be going back someday.","January 20, 2014",Ahh Las Tortugas,12,"Key Largo, Florida",5

Ship staff were very nice; food (breakfast and lunch) plentiful and tasty and exceeded my expectations given you are on a ferry! Take the tour at the fort, which was interesting and entertaining.

We were able to wait at the dock until the doors opened, and then we waited inside until we could check in and board. Our trip out aboard the ferry was incredible- turquoise blue waters with overcast skies. In the distance we saw several rainstorms, but aboard the boat we were not rained on.The key and the Fort began to appear in the distance. Just watching the island at approach is beautiful. We took a tour of Fort Jefferson, and it was interesting and informative. Unfortunately those rainshowers caught up to us and we were rained on twice. We sheltered inside the old ruins of the fort and just enjoyed our time there.Once the rain passed over, I took advantage of the opportunity to borrow a snorkel and mask.

It was cloudy and windy. If it were sunny we could have just laid at the beach. I went to snorkel but the water was so murky I couldn't see but a foot or two in front of my face. I almost ran into a coral. On the boat ride back the Dramamine didn't seem to work as well as I enjoyed views of people vomiting over the side of the boat. I have known people to enjoy this trip, but its not for me. The boat crew was very nice though.","January 17, 2014",Boring,4,"Key West, Florida",2

Worth the extra $125/person because of the time it took (40 minutes vs. 2 hours and 20 minutes by ferry), because of the view, and because I get seasick!

You can just feel the history as you walk around. Can you imagine living on this island? Nothing close by except for a few other islands. We were able to get our National Park Passport stamped at the Fort. After the tour there was a wonderful lunch and then time for snorkeling. The ferry provided snorkeling gear or you could bring your own. The fish were plentiful and colorful and you didn't have to go far from the docks to see them. Current could be very fast in some other areas. Pleasant trip back to Key West. All in all, a wonderful day.","January 14, 2014",Loved the experience,38,"ftmyersbeach,fl",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We went on the Yankee Freedom III, great trip. The Park is lovely, a nature lovers paradise, out all alone in the middle of the gulf. There are a couple of beautiful beaches there, and Ft. Jefferson is very cool, young kids would especially like the fort.The YF crew is very attentive and nice. Don't fool yourself into thinking that because the ship is a large double catamaran that there won't be sea motion. On the way out it was calm waters and there was still constant motion, now on the way back it was very rough and several people got sick. I used an OTC motion sickness pill and the seabands and didn't even get nauseated, which I do get motion sickness pretty easily, so think before hand about what you need to treat yourself so you don't feel like crap on your trip!The seating on the catamaran is comfortable, they don't sell all the seats so you don't have to be too cramped, they give a continental breakfast and lunch which were both adequate, but I packed a lunch and we ate picnic on the beach, although you could get your lunch from the boat and take it to the beach to eat also, there are also picnic tables and grassy areas around the fort.The bathrooms (4) are only on the boat, none on the island so the boat is docked at Ft. Jeff all day for people to come and go and use as they please, they have snorkel gear for everyone to use and there are things to see if you snorkel. There is inside and outside seating on the YF, upper and lower decks, and each person can bring a bag or two and keep it with them. Bring your beach towels and clothing in case you are cool while the YF is moving, I wore a light sweatshirt both ways and was glad I had it (late dec.).They have guided tours of Ft. Jeff or you can go in and out at your leisure. If you are a photo bug the fort has these gaping holes in the walls with ocean views beyond, it is a great photo spot, pics with your family framed in these openings in the brick walls with the blue green water behind them are a great option!There is a gift shop with books and souvenirs only but you really need to bring any specifics you will need for the day with you, although it seems the YF does have some items like nausea med, ginger ale, water on the boat, there is no type of real store or anything at the destination. You will lose cell/3G/4G coverage about 20 minutes out to sea and be out of touch until you are that close back into Key West again in the late afternoon. You can park your scooter at multiple areas on the streets around the ferry terminal or park your car in the parking deck on Grinnell St right by the terminal, or take a pink cab there! When you come off the ship in the early evening you are right at Half Shell, Schooner Wharf, Turtle Kraals, etc to eat and drink (if you didn't let yourself get sick on the boat)! Or you are back in time to watch the sun finish setting from various points along the water (or well ahead of sunset time in the summer months). Coming back into port on the ship in winter (sunset time about 6pm) is very lovely and photogenic! Bring something to take photos, videos and some extra charger juice for your devices, although there may have been outlets by the interior seating but I'm not sure about that at all.My biggest hesitation before the trip was that it is a full day trip, 7-530, but I really enjoyed it, especially since I took precautions to not get motion sickness, I loved the trips out and back on the catamaran and the time at Dry Tortugas and Fort Jeff! We will definitely be doing this trip again in the future, and to me it is totally worth the price of the trip (we pd $165 each for adults). I'm attaching photos. Here is a gopro video my husband made from our day there http://vimeo.com/82863571","January 7, 2014","Very cool and fun journey, excellent destination!",144,"Roswell, Georgia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the 8:00 AM seaplane excursion to Dry Tortugas Na Park. The plane only carries 10 passengers plus pilot and co-pilot (each person has their own window). It's a 35-40 minute flight; much shorter than the 2-1/2 hour boat trips. By taking the 8:00 AM trip, we arrived well before the boat crowd and had the place to ourselves. The brick fortress is very impressive. Great place to explore. We only did the half day excursion, but 2-1/2 hours on the island was plenty of time for us. If you want to snorkel, have a picnic, etc., do the whole day. The seaplane excursion is pricey but well worth it. We also saw sea turtles swimming while flying to the park (the plane only flies about 500 feet above the water).","January 6, 2014",A Must See,16,"Irwin, PA",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the ferry and had a wonderful time. I had concerns about it being a crowded ferry, but there was plenty of room to sit either inside or out, and to easily move around so it never felt crowded. The optional tour of the island was done in small groups. The crew was truly amazing. They were enthusiastic, helpful and kind, and really went out of their way with the guests. The breakfast and lunch were very good. The weather wasn't spectacular for us, but we had a very good time. You need to book the trip way in advance. It is expensive, but the fee includes everything for the day, and totally worthwhile to visit this amazing place.","January 5, 2014",Wonderful day,37,"Burlington, Vermont",5

The chain of little islands, or keys, we're interesting, too, with the history of their formation and some of the boat and ship wrecks visible from the planThen we arrived on the main island of the Dry Tortugas, in what is now a national park, and spent the next two hours exploring the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"So the ferry ticket out to the park is kinda steep, but for about $5 more you can camp overnight on this unique historic site in the middle of nowhere.Once all the day-trippers load back onto the ferry and sail off you have this awesome site pretty much to yourself from 3pm, until 10:30 the next day. I was free to wander along the adjacent island beach that leads out to the protected bird sanctuary, toured Fort Jefferson in near solitude, snorkeled, ate fresh snapper caught right off the parks dock, and slept under an amazing star-lit sky. At night, look for pockets of phosphorescent algae floating around the waters of the fort (run your fingers through the water and their glow intensifies), and stroll through the forts courtyard late at night and spook yourself into believing a few of the ghost stories about the place. The camping area itself is small, but sites are well spaced out and offer a degree of privacy; particularly if you grab a site tucked in the trees. Each site has a picnic table and a grill. The park service has coolers left behind by other campers should you decide you need one, and the ferry service sells bags of ice (for a mere $7). There are pit toilets available and the park service personnel are on the island 24/7 should an emergency arise. Of course, in order to make the most of this experience, the weather needs to cooperate. This was my first time in Key West and I settled on this vacation destination; in part, because camping Dry T sounded like a must. I had 9 days in KW and booked the DT camping for day 3&4; however, seas were rough and the Yankee Freedom ferry cancelled service the day I was supposed to go out. Having another 5-6 days in KW, I was flexible, so rescheduled the trip for a few days later when it looked like the weather would improve...and it did!So my advice to others would be to schedule this trip (camping or not) on the front end of your vacation, because if the weather doesn't cooperate, the ferry service will always let you reschedule or give you a full refund. Also, for those intent on camping, be aware that if sea conditions are too rough for the ferry to run, then you are stuck on the island another day...and another, until they feel its safe to run again. (Since I solely relied on the ferry service, I can't speak for the plane charter services that go out to the island and what their weather restrictions are).","January 1, 2014",Make the most of it and CAMP!,6,"manchester, ct",5

After we toured the fort we were fitted with snorkel gear (they showed us an instructional video on the way over) and directed toward the best area to snorkel. The white sand beach was superior to any on Key West and we enjoyed our next couple of hours.

We also walked around the moat walk and then along the shores of the beach toward the island blocked off to preserve bird habitats.

We rode the Yankee Freedom Ferry to Fort Jefferson and was very pleased with the staff on the ferry. Although the ferry ride was VERY costly, the meals and cleanliness were great and made the sting of the cost a little less. Our ride was smooth and none of us experienced any sort of seasickness. We stayed out in the fresh air most of the trip. Upon arrival, the National Park worker gave us our instructions and we chose our campsite. We spent the afternoon snorkeling together. We saw lots of colorful fish, barracuda, coral, and even a nurse shark! The snorkeling there was the highlight! Although the snorkeling was great everywhere, we enjoyed the coral heads the best. The best part of the camping experience was the solitude. When the ferry pulled away with all the rest of the passengers in the afternoon, we were left on the island with only two other people. It was fantastic! We felt like we had our own private island. The snorkeling seemed better with all the people gone, too. At dusk, we used the grill at the campsite and grilled burgers. We watched the sun set from the moat and the experience was surreal. We slept in tents and woke the next morning and broke down camp. When the ferry arrived, the crew loaded all of our gear up for us and we were able to relax for the remainder of the day. We enjoyed a long, relaxing lunch inside the air conditioned cabin of the ferry. We did some more snorkeling and we toured the Fort. The entire trip was wonderful!

It was anything but that and it was a very interesting tour. My husband snorkeled (equipment included in the cost) and I just relaxed on the beach after touring the fort.

I sat up top and enjoyed the sunshine and read (same thing that I would do at the beach so no big deal) I joined the 40 minute tour of Fort Jefferson which was very informative and very well delivered. Then went snorkelling on the south side(north side to rough to see anything) and enjoyed looking at the fish and coral that is growing along the wall.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is an amazing trip. We took the boat and love it. I was with an 8 yr old girl and she loved it too. She was not bored on the boat, they show videos of snorkeling, etc. and point things out along the way. We were lucky to have a gorgeous day. The weather plays a big role in this trip. If you have a bad day, it might not be as much fun. We toured the fort, snorkeled swam, walked the moat and looked at fish 0- basically just explored. It's amazing. I totally forgot to look at the birds! Even brough binoculars, but I was so blown away by the fish I forgot!!! The crew on the yankee freedome was great. Food was perfect. I was a little put off by the crew at the end of the trip standing at the exit with a tip bucket. It just rubbed me the wrong way since I just paid over $200 for the trip. I would not have minded tipping, but I didn't like the feeling of being shamed into it by them holding a bucket and staring at me. That really bothered me. I would tell anyone to do this trip, but maybe book it once you know the weather - this trip will go even if the weather is bad and sea is rough so you might want to make sure it's going to be a decent day. Don't forget a towel and water shoes - it can be rocky in the water. Most important, bring your camera!!!!","December 8, 2013",top of our list,64,"Baltimore, Maryland",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If I could give this more than five stars, I would! The entire day was simply fantastic. The staff on the Yankee Freedom are friendly, helpful, funny and very knowledgeable about Dry Tortugas. The tour of Fort Jefferson was very interesting and will appeal to any history buff, especially those interested in war history. The snorkeling around the fort is among the best out there, and even if you don't snorkel you can still see some great fish as you walk around the moat wall. The bird watching is also interesting, and I hear it is even better in the peak nesting season in the spring. I love national parks and have been to several, but Dry Tortugas is among the most unique. Definitely take a day for this trip!","December 3, 2013",This is a must-do!,110,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We did the boat ride to the park on a day with rough seas. The waves were 7 to 10 feet and the captain gave people the option for a refund if they chose. I am so glad I went. Some people did get sick, but the crew was amazing, immediately tending to all that were ill. Breakfast and lunch was all you can eat, this helped some of the people become seasick. Please, if you are not good on the ocean, don't have eggs, yogurt, orange juice and fruit for breakfast. It is really that simple. Once there it was great. Jeff, one of the guides knows all the history of the island, make sure you sign up with him for the tour. After the tour, you are on your own, great snorkeling around the island, camping and fishing are also available. (reservations with the national park service needed for camp availability).

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Fascinating Pre-Civil War history and education, unanswered questions and myriad curiosities, swimming in clear, turquoise waters on white sandy beaches, amazing snorkeling, ideas for future camping under the starriest skies, and fun ferry ride make this a day trip we will never forget. It will cost a premium to go via ferry (or private seaplane, if you're inclined), but between the two meals, the trip (including choppy waters on the way back--be forewarned), and the feeling of remoteness makes this a top ten travel adventure along the Eastern seaboard. After all, you're about 70 miles from the Southernmost point in the U.S., and deep within the Gulf where they have confirmed and reconfirmed through numerous tests that BP didn't leave its imprint.","November 29, 2013",One of those things you just have to do.,6,DC,5

Boat service superb, they give a guided tour of the fort as well. Boat supplies snorkel gear so bring a change of clothes and go under the sea; remember this area is more of a marine life sanctuary than an old fort . Boat has breakfast and lunch. Go first to the galley area and claim an eating spot. Do not rush to eat they have plenty of food.Amazing views in every direction the entire trip. Even my wife who is not into history was satisfied.

We walked around the whole fort and were constantly amazed at the construction that went into this fort more than 150 years ago. Very informal self guided tour of the fort which lends itself to free exploration. We also went snorkeling and this was good for Atlantic snorkeling. There was an area of pylons which had a large variety of fish including Barracuda. The seaplane is the best way to go, but if limited funds then the boat is probably fine. I can't wait to go back.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"My husband and I went on the ferry boat trip to The Dry Tortugas in late September as part of a Key West long weekend. At first we hesitated because of the time (early rise - all day away) and money (couple/few hundred bucks) but then we decided to go for it. We bought our tickets from the ticket office the night before and arrived on time for check in and departure. (I have been sick while deep sea fishing so I took one Dramamine one hour before travel but I probably would have been ok without it as it was a fairly calm ride.) The boat was neat, clean, and well organized. After the passengers got situated an appetizing cold breakfast buffet was set out that included bagels, cereals, juices, fruit, and coffee. The trip to The Dry Tortugas was in full sun on deck coming (and going) so sun screen and a hat was a must. We stayed on deck the whole time but inside I think there was a snorkeling how-to video (gear was provided but we brought our own) and another on the history of the island. Eventually a speck in the distance became the island. It was breathtaking how a fortress just ""appeared"" out of the blue of the ocean. The boat docked and passengers disembarked. Lunch would be served in about an hour. My husband went to snorkel and I opted for the fort tour led by a Park Ranger/ferry boat guide. The tour and tour guide were both interesting and I was quite entertained by the history and lore surrounding that massive structure. It was hot, much of the tour was in direct sunlight, and some walking and stair climbing was involved. Nothing I would call strenuous but proper clothing, footwear and sunblock would aid to your enjoyment of the outing. After the tour we returned to the boat for a lunch buffet of sandwiches, sides, and sodas. It was all nicely presented and delicious. Despite those childhood warnings we went swimming immediately after we ate - snorkeling in fact! My husband thought the best snorkeling he'd found was out to a buoy and then back along the side of the fort. We headed out to the buoy, and then snorkeled two sides of the fort (one was calm and one was a little rougher - but neither was too challenging for even a novice snorkeler). All offered great views of sea life. Thankfully NO JELLY FISH at the fort although we saw lots on the boat rides. Check the most recent reviews for daily conditions. We were concerned and got lucky. Jelly fish would have been a deal breaker for us considering the cost of the trip. When time was up we boarded the boat (roll call was taken) and enjoyed background music and an open bar serving soft drinks and reasonably priced (and tasty!) tropical concoctions and beer. We relaxed on the return trip to Key West and reflected on a fabulous day of fun in the sun on The Dry Tortugas.","November 18, 2013",A unique excursion that's well worth the time and money,162,"Atlanta, GA",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Sea Plane out to the Island. It was about a 20 minute ride out to the park. Landing and taking off on the water was an adventure by itself.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"i just took my first trip to Fort Jefferson at the Dry Tortugas. What occurred to me right away is we could probably explore this place for days and not be bored. It's huge, has three floors, with details to explore everywhere you look. We only had a few hours but next time we come, we will be camping. Bring a flashlight; we found a couple darkened nooks and even a hidden (very!) dark room with measurements written on the wall. If it's not cordoned off, apparently it's free for the explorer to find.For visitors with young children, say 6 and under, get ready to pay special attention. The second and third floors do not have any barriers at the edge of the wall and even those with a fear of heights may have trouble, especially on the top of the fort.That said, this would be an amazing and unforgettable place to explore with kids (mine weren't along this time). Even for smaller kids, just the number of birds that approach and the countless hermit crabs would keep my kids giggling for days.We went on the seaplane, which was just as much fun as the fort. The boat is enjoyable by all accounts but much more sensitive to the weather as high seas will make your trip miserable. Depending on flight arrival time, you might be with only a few other people on the island - which adds to the remote silence and we started to lose track of time. There are only a few National Parks where you can really feel solitude and this is definitely one of them. The isolation would be damped by the many other people on the ferry. This is another reason we would love to camp here. I would have loved to see the night sky from here in person.The weather in the days before our visit had been very windy so snorkeling was cloudy and we were trying to cram in as much as possible so didn't have time to explore all the recommended spots.","November 14, 2013",Worth every penny - don't miss this,27,"Spearfish, South Dakota",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"When we visited, we took the Fast Cat out, (the plane ride is less of a time commitment, but pricier). The boat ride is long and can get a little bumpy across some of the channels, keep that in mind if you get sea sick.We actually went out on one of the worst day; when we got to the dock, we found out that the plane and none of the other boats were going out that day due to the weather conditions. The captain announced that they would refund or exchange tickets (which they rarely do) and about half of the crowd took him up on the offer. On the way out, the trip took and extra 1-1/2 hours and we were bouncing all over -- probably half of people spent the trip hanging over the stern, feeding their breakfast to the fish. When we got to Garden Key, there were a bunch of people practically kissing the ground when they got off the boat - until the captain pointed out that, we still had to go back :D However, the weather had cleared by time of the return and it was a nice smooth ride home.Once there, it's is a relaxing, casual destination. You just sort of wandered around the walls of the fort and there are a few displays to see. The scenery is beautiful, nothing but water in every direction, you really get a sense of desolation. Snorkeling is available, the boat we took hade equipment on board to use, but since the water was so choppy that day, we didn't bother.As mentioned the seaplane is more expensive, but I have heard that the views flying low over the crystal-clear water are amazing.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Hello, i'm 26 now, but i still remember what a wonderful time i had there when i was a senior in high school. snorkeling around the mote was by far my favorite. clear water and so many colorful fish. in addition, the excision included a pack lunch during the afternoon which perfect, since i was starving after a day of snorkeling. my family and i wonder away from the tour guide and went exploring on our own. which was good, b/c you can read the history before hand. we were ahead of the group which mean we can take pictures to our heart desire without people in the way. I'm not going to lie, but me and my mom saw paranormal activity while wondering on our own. we saw did a couple of double takes because we ""thought we saw"" a person in a military uniform. i mean, how can a ghost appear in broad day light right?? anyways, we hit the water after we found our way out of the fort. (if you stick with the tour guide you wouldn't get as much time in the water). i had a blast!!! the water is truly amazing...i was disappointed when my family and i arrived to key west. there wasn't any nice beach with white sand and blue water. but then i saw an ad for this place and hope it would make up for the trip. and it did by far, i couldn't believe that florida keys could hide such a treasure. truly enjoyed it and still remembered it vividly to this day.","November 11, 2013",My most memorable in key west,10,"Houston, Texas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If youre looking for a one of a kind day trip while in Key West then a trip to Dry Tortugas is the way to go. Dry Tortugas is an isolated island with a beautifully constructed Civil War era fort built on it 2+ hrs off the coast of Key West. There are two fairly small beaches on the island which doesnt really matter since, in relation to the size of the fort, only a handful of visitors come each day. The park rangers are friendly and provide a nice walking tour of the fort. There is also camping on the island which provides a unique experience, im sure. You are able to walk just about anywhere you want within the fort (the roof of the wall and the subsuquent levels have many rooms to explore) and receive a glimpse of what past life must have been like in this isolated part of the ""pirate"" world. Also, you can enjoy a nice picnic (provided by the ferry) on the beach and sunbath in the warm sun year around.All in all, Dry Tortugas is enjoyable and worth a trip.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the family to the island in July and camped for 3 days and nights. We rode the ferry boat out and back. (I will review the boat separately but will say I highly recommend it as well.)The history, the snorkeling, the turquoise water, the breeze, the quiet, the sunset, the wildlife, the view... It was all better than the brochures suggested. There is too much to list here on this review but I will say do not limit yourself to a day trip, it just isn't long enough to see and do and experience everything this magical place has to offer. We felt like we were in a different country and in a different time. We toured the fort and were amazed at the craftsmanship and attention to detail. It is impressive now, but it would have been wonderful to have seen it in its heyday. I'm sure it was magnificent to behold, even if the conditions were unpleasant. It was sad to see the building crumbling in places but it did add to its character. The views from the crumbling windows was spectacular. My wife took over 1200 photos! The lighthouse works and was beautiful at night. We went up on top of the fort to watch the sunset. My oldest played his guitar and we sang as we watched the sun set over Loggerhead island. Be sure and take plenty of flashlights and batteries and an extra memory card for your camera!We camped in campsite #8. It had lots of shelter from the rain and sun and we got the breeze from the ocean all night which made the nights more bearable. Be sure to take a hard cased box with a lid or ice chest to keep all your food in. The island is covered with hermit crabs and they will crawl into anything you leave open. Ask me how I know! It was a lot of fun to watch the hermit crabs try to carry off the dates that had fallen from the palms. There was a sea turtle nest near our campsite. We were hoping to see some hatchlings but it didn't happen on our watch. However - we were excited to see some of the phosphorescent fish in the water at night. Apparently they only appear once a year. They light up like lightning bugs do and if they feel threatened, they emit a cloud of light. It was very cool!The snorkeling was fabulous! The water around the pylons had the best assortment of plants and fish and was crystal clear. I recommend the Olympus TG-820. Waterproof, sand and drop proof. It took wonderfully clear photos under the water. We saw Barracudas, beautiful sea plants, and lots of corals. The fish were friendly and unafraid. If you wait until the ferry takes the day passengers back to Key West, you basically have the island and the ocean to yourself!Take plenty of water, your own charcoal, matches and food. There is nowhere to purchase food and water after the ferry leaves. It is truly primitive camping. The only thing furnished is a picnic table and a grate for charcoal. There are portable outhouses but no running water or plumbing so there are also no showers. We took wet wipes and extra water. There is a gift shop with souvenirs you won't want to miss but they don't sell food or drink.There is no cellphone service at all and no electricity but during the day when the ferry is docked, you can use the electrical outlets and bathrooms on board. No showers though. We had the best Park Ranger ever while on duty. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. He didn't cut the kids any slack on the Jr Ranger program that's for sure! I would recommend him by name, but he requested no photos and no names on the internet. We all loved it and were sad to leave. It's an experience we will never forget and someday I hope to go back. I highly recommend it to everyone!","October 27, 2013",We loved it!!,11,"Ada, Oklahoma",5

The ride on the boat was a few hours, not a bad trip at all and well worth it! Upon arrival, we spent the first few hours laying on the deserted white sand beach and snorkeling in the crystal clear water. All gear was provided by the ferry crew. We then took up a self guided tour of Fort Jefferson. It's huge and truly amazing place built in pre-civil war times. It's as far away as you can get and still be in the USA! Paradise for us but misery for those who lived there when the fort was manned by over a 1,000 troops! The place is so big that we felt like we were there by ourselves.

We spent the time walking about and exploring the amazing building. I could not believe that all those years ago they had built such a magnificent structure in such a remote place.

I do wish there was more in the way of development with history education etc. If you want a unique and adventurous getaway - this is the place!","October 20, 2013",Absolutely awesome,45,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was the highlight of out Florida vacation. So glad we were there before the shutdown. The boat ride there can make you a bit queezy but they sell pill and give you free ginger ale. On the way back it is fine. It is the ocean, what are you gonna do?Lunch was good, make your own sandwiches, and breakfast could be improved with a toaster. Bagels do not taste good not toasted.The tour of Fort Jefferson was very informative and interesting. The views from the fort are magnificent. The snorkeling was interesting as well. One of the areas was so dense with little fish and then the big fish would swim through them. The reefs were so-so but we saw some cool wildlife like a school of cuttlefish.We had a great time on this tour, the staff was super nice, I feel bad for them out of a job right now.","October 16, 2013",Breathtaking!,298,"San Jose, California",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Long, expensive trip out to the gorgeous Dry Tortugas. Nice boat with all the amenities helped. Great snorkeling around the fort but the fort itself is totally undeveloped. It is just the remaining structure with no history tours, video tours, photo ops. The fort was a huge disappointment. Slightly glad we went because it was always on our bucket list but would never go again. Park service is dropping the ball on this one. It could easily be upgraded to a wonderful trip.","October 14, 2013",Great snorkeling - boring fort,66,"Tampa, Florida",3
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Perhaps the best thing about traveling is seeing something the world has to offer that can't be found anywhere else. I think this may qualify... First the bad... you're up very early on an island not intended for such. You will get sunburned most likely, despite your best preventative efforts. Odds are decent you'll get a jellyfish sting as well.Buuut.... You rip through the tropics on a very fast boat. You'll see many sea turtles on the ride, some under the water, others splashing on the surface. The hulking fort on the horizon is quite a sight, and once you hear that the range of the cannons was three miles you can imagine how ominous and impregnable it might have felt to enemy ships. Enclosed in hexagon of 16 million bricks amidst the sea there is a sense of both beauty and desolation, tranquil oceanic calm and shipwrecked despair, at once Robinson Crusoe, post-exile Napolean, and Jacques Cousteau. Those who lived there were dutiful souls. Indeed duty likely precluded a mindset suited to the place. And that is of appreciation of aesthete and simplicity. The shimmering of the schools, the diligence of the birds, the untrammeled night skies... life moves slow and rhythmically out there... largo. Alas we are but specks.","October 14, 2013",Unique and memorable day in the Tortugas,19,"Belchertown, Massachusetts",4

The boat ride out was worth the trip but then to be on a tinny island that is nearly consumed by this massive brick fort was awesome. We learned about the history,we snorkeled, we enjoyed a great lunch, and took lots of pictures. Don't miss this attraction and part of American history.

Wandering around the fort and watching the birds was a lot of fun. You can get there by seaplane or by boat. We went on the Yankee Freedom trip. It's a whole day trip. It took 2 and a half hours just to get there. For more information, see my review of the Yankee Freedom III, but if you don't then just remember this important fact: There's no fresh water available on the island. Be sure to bring your own. If you go on the Yankee Freedom, I still suggest bringing a bottle for water on the island.","October 12, 2013",Highlight of my whole trip,80,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the Yankee Freedom ferry, the crew was awesome & the boat in nice shape. Google it for details and prices (which were fair). The captain allowed visits to the bridge, and answered questions about everything from the boat to the journey to Ft. Jefferson. The rest of the crew were VERY knowledgable about sea life, birds, and then the history of the Fort. The tour of it was about 45 minutes and then there was plenty of time to stroll around alone, take photos (and places to sneak a few *risque* ones if you want) and explore. There is ample time to tour, snorkel, laze in the sun, etc. The island is absolutely stunning, the views, snorkeling, beach, water.... Lunch on the boat is a nice picnic style- sammies, chips, veggies, sodas, sort of thing. The return trip was also just as good- with many more questions answered, stories told and cocktails enjoyed (extra $$, but fair). A great day long adventure, would highly recommend.","October 10, 2013",Dry Tortugas - Yankee Freedom,2,Urbandale,5

Jefferson to take pictures - Amazing fort - 16 million bricks, 3 stories tall with a moat and 8ft thick walls. I climbed to the top and the view was amazing. Only problem was the heat - very hot and no breeze! Waded out in the crystal clear water - huge fish close to the boat. Beautiful day! A nice lunch was served - good music.

The whole experience was very well organized. The water and landscape was the most beautiful we had ever seen and we have been to most of the islands.

It does take up the entire day, but it is well worth the time since you are immersed in the natural beauty of the region plus you learn a good deal about the history of the area. The ferry ride is very pleasent (though get there early, grab a seat and keep it since it tends to be crowded) and the crew all very professional and helpful. The fort itself is great and you could spend hours roaming around in the old battlements. The National Park service does a good job trying to keep it in good repair with the challenges of its location. The snorkeling is excellent. There are several different areas to choose from and we saw a good deal of sea life.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It is a great little gem, from Key West. I had it on my bucket list for more than 10years, and finally it happened. Recommend that seaplane ride in, as it is fast and you don't waste too much time on the ride to and from. We used Keywest Seaplanes and the ride was a great. You fly over the water at about 100ft - 200fr. It is about 40m to get to the park, at which time, you have about 2 hours before the boat shows up on the dock. We had another couple with us, so we had 4 people exploring the park for an entire 2 hours before anyone else. That is pretty nice, its so quiet and the fact that you have the place all to yourself, that was worth it. There is a little sandy beach, and there were 7 campers that were on site when we landed. The best snorkeling is by the old South coal moarings, a whole bunch of piers sticking up. I saw a lot of fish despite the fact that a tropical storm had rolled thru 2 weeks prior.

It's not a cheap trip, but it's well worth it. The boat ride was long, but we were fed a good buffet breakfast almost immediately after leaving the port. A decent lunch buffet is served while you are on the island. You can eat on the boat or take your food to one of the picnic tables on the grounds. when you arrive, I highly recommend taking the guided tour because you'll get to hear some very interesting facts and information. You'll still have plenty of time to explore on your own or visit the beach. You'll get a beautiful view walking the top of the fort, and walking around the fort along the sea wall was incredible. I would recommend grabbing a table when you arrive to put your belongings on while you're on the tour or exploring on your own. There aren't many tables in the shade but there is one that we grabbed right off the dock. The return boat ride was fast and very windy for about an hour.

All of the crew (Captain Andy, Bob, Liz, etc) were super personable and very helpful. After arriving you are offered a guided tour of the fort or to go on your own. I would say follow a guide for the information and then go off on your own. There is terrific snorkeling around the Island. We saw many fish, coral, even stingrays! Lunch is provided on the boat. There is a bar open after 2 PM (National Park Rules). The food was good and fresh. This was an absolute FUN FUN day and I would certainly do it again.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We visit Key West every year, and my single favorite thing to do is to visit the Tortugas National Park. It beats any snorkel trip or anything else you'll do during your vacation. Where else can you see a REAL Civil War era military fort AND do the best snorkel/scuba trip of your life in the same day???You have two options to get there: (a) boat or (b) seaplane. Unfortunately, the boats (the Yankee Freedom and the Fury) pack you on like sardines. So bring a bag with a ""get wet"" book because you won't have room to move during the boat ride out to the Tortugas. Also, they have gone WAY UP in price. The trips are now running about $175/person. It's a long boat ride- I would NOT recommend it for small children.BUT. It really is like two excursions in one. It is by far the best diving or snorkeling you will do all week.

The park was very interesting - I had no idea about the history of it. We took snorkel gear and spend an hour or so snorkeling. The kids can run around and play pirates.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I am so glad that my girlfriend and I decided to take this trip!After talking with our inn keeper at the Key West Bed and Breakfast, we decided to take this trip on Saturday. It was a little pricey, but the boat trip, history, and snorkeling was well worth it!Our trip started with a departure at 8am. We were served breakfast. Nothing fancy, but they had hard boiled eggs, ham, cheeses, fruit, bagels/bread, yogurt, milk/juice, and cereal. Basically a continental hotel breakfast.The boat ride is about 2.5 hrs. The guide and captain will point out other islands along the way as well as historical trade/warship routes. I enjoy the history portion, so hearing these things was awesome. When you don't feel like sitting take a bit to walk around the boat, especially the outside deck. Take in the Ocean Breeze and relax outside.When you arrive and step off the boat they have organized tours around the National Park. You are also welcome to walk around freely, taking in the sites (which is what we chose to do). The history is remarkable on this island, especially seeing where Dr. Mudd was imprisoned.When you've had enough of the tour, strap on a snorkel (provided, but we brought our own) and hop in the water. There are plenty of fish (saw some barracudas and some jelly fish) and things to see. You can also just lay out on the beach and relax.Lunch is provided, with fixings for sandwiches as well as potato salads and water/soda provided. They open the bar around 2pm as well, so you can purchase beer and mixed drinks as well as candy/assorted treats that aren't included with the lunch. The drinks are pretty fairly priced with a beer at 3$ (4$ for a premium beer) and 5$ for a mixed drink (6$ for a frozen drink). They take cash and credit, but there is a 15$ minimum with a credit card.The ride back was just as easy as the ride in, getting you back around 5.Overall a fantastic trip!","September 4, 2013",Hidden Gem!,12,"Bradenton, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"so pleased we finally made the trip! Starting with the super clean boat, to the exceptional crew to the tasty food. And the great history lesson and narration. The fort itself was interesting, hard to imagine the amount of people and bricks and boats so many years ago!! Unfortunately there were a lot of jellyfish so unable to swim or snorkel. I wish there was a little more to do on the island, but I guess you can't change history!!","September 4, 2013","It's a ""must see"" kind of place",1,,4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"A 21/2 hr. boat trip each way with 5 hrs or so on an island occupied by a huge historic fort/prison and nothing else. Tour the prison/walk around the island(its very small)/go swimming and/or snorkeling. Breakfast and lunch are included in the $169 per person price and are nothing special. The crew is great, very helpful and informative. Snorkeling gear is also included and was very good. The snorkeling was much better than I anticipated. We snorkeled with a 5 foot tarpon for a while and saw some great coral/sponges and fish including jellyfish and little cuttlefish or squid. The cost is high but its a once in a lifetime type of thing.","September 3, 2013",Better than expected but pricey,146,"Port Saint Lucie, Florida",5

It's cool to see the massive structure built over 150 years ago in such a remote location. The beaches are ok for snorkeling and fun but I think the boats offering snorkeling are a better value. The beaches were also full of jellies.,"September 3, 2013",Interesting but not worth a full day,3,Washington DC,3

I think 4 hours on the island would have been a bit much, plus with the plane (we did the afternoon trip) the boat was leaving just as we were arriving so we had the island to ourselves (10 on the plane plus a few campers). The snorkeling was amazing, definitely worth the expense of getting there, although we had some jellyfish to contend with. 2 hours was plenty of time to explore and snorkel.","September 3, 2013",Worth the trip,52,"cape cod, ma",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,Anyone going to Key West must take a trip over to the Dry Totugas. The best way to go is by seaplane. It is well worth the money.

After you check out the fort you can eat lunch and then go snorkeling. This was probably the kids favorite part. Right along the seawall in 3-4' of water was all kids of fish.You need to make reservation ahead of time and it wasn't cheap, you can fly over there by seaplane if you can afford that.

Then just as the crowds arrive on the ferry you jump on the seaplane and head back to key west in time for lunch... unforgettable,"August 27, 2013",Almost private paradise,4,,5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Nice day trip, 2.5 hrs, boat very smooth and we had pretty nice weather. Boat seemed to move quicker than we imagined. Breakfast began shortly after boarding and consisted of cold breakfast, bagels, butter, jam, fruit, lunch meat, coffee, juice, hard boiled eggs, good for cold breakfast and had plenty to eat, wished they would have had toaster for bagels or toast as they aren't too good cold. We were a little disappointed in only having a few hrs on island to explore and snorkel, after a very short tour with the guide of the Fort, we felt we didn't have time enough to even walk all around the fort if we wanted to snorkel and also had to return to the boat before 1pm to eat lunch.. Had hoped to be able to walk all around the fort and in the office there, ran short of time as we wanted to snorkel. Snorkeling not so good outside of the pilings around the fort. Pilings had quite a bit of coral to see and we saw a larger tarpon and Permit fish along with many very small fish. I guess we expected a little more brilliance in the fish and those we did see were very small. A few said they had seen some larger fish. Area around pilings is the best place to see anything. It's approx. 5-9 ft would recommend that inexperienced swimmers use a vest provided by boat to help keep them above water. Waves kept bouncing us back and forth around pilings so it was hard to get good underwater pictures and hard not to get pushed into the pilings at times. The guide was fairly fast on tour of the fort, however they do not go around the entire fort and if you want to explore the fort you must do so within the few remaining hours. We left feeling we did not get to see all of the fort, it's shop, etc. Arrived island approx. 10:30, obtained snorkel gear and then guided tour of fort, this all took almost 1 hour so approx. 11:30 we felt we had better eat before snorkeling so we wouldn't have to rush back before 1pm. If you didn't eat by 1pm there was no food later. Good decision to eat right after tour as bulk of the crowd returned to eat approx. 12pm. Longer line to get food, fewer tables, etc. After lunch felt we only had approx. 2 hours to snorkel or explore as had to turn in snorkel equipment, change clothes, board by 2:30. We enjoyed the trip and would recommend it to others. Staff on boat were helpful and all very cordial. If I had to do again, not sure if I'd go again, but if so I may opt for the Sea Plane as it is only about $100 more and may provide more time on the island and believe it would be beautiful to see from the air. Lunch was also good, cold sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, salads, etc. Plenty to eat with decent variety of meats, drinks, etc. Wish lunch could be served on return trip to not eat into time on island. All personnel were very helpful, cordial, etc. On return trip they sell drinks, cocktails, frozen drinks, beer, some snacks but all to be paid for to include soda and water. Frozen drinks about $7. Bring change of clothes if you want, dressing rooms on island and the boat has outdoor showers to rinse off. It was nice to change to dry clothing for ride back. Sun is bright and suggest sunscreen. We enjoyed the trip just wish it was a longer day. We thought it was expensive, but figured that breakfast and lunch would have cost about $15-$20 each meal, snorkel rental, and boat ride, I guess if you look at it that way it is not so bad and it is something you most likely will only do once unless you are fortunate to be able to camp on the island. I think that would have been the best way to see it. If you have the time I would recommend doing a few day camping trip.","August 26, 2013",Day trip to the Dry Tortugas,32,"Sunshine, Louisiana",4

Use sunscreen as you are guaranteed a nice burn for this full day of relaxation. A good sandwich lunch is also provided at the boat docked at the fort.

Dry Tortugas National Park,This is so worth the cost of taking the 2.5 hour boat trip on the Yankee Freedom. You would not believe that you are off of the coast of Florida. The water is crystal clear blue green (see my profile photo). You would swear you were somewhere in the Caribbean.We put off taking this trip for about 2-3 years due to the cost. I finally decided to just do it and am so glad that I did. We lucked out and went on a day when there wasn't a cloud in the sky and it never rained.Exploring the fort is fun as is snorkeling. I'm not much of a snorkeler but I was smart and brought my pool noodle and just floated around. Make sure you bring an underwater camera because you'll see tons of cool fish.There is overnight camping available as well but that wasn't something that interested us.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our trip to the dry tortugas was excellent. There is something about the combination of the area's historical significance and the natural landscape and adventuring that draws me in. The ferry staff were very friendly, but I used the ferry ride to and from to catch up on sleep from a week of exploring the keys. Once on the island, I skipped the guided tour and went strait to the water as you only have a few hours on the island with the ferry. For those reviewers below complaining about their experience and the cost. I cant imagine spending $165+ to bring young children here. There are beaches and other great outing opportunities all over the keys. I spent the day out here with my wife and we really enjoyed it, but we knew what we were going to see and this was our big splurge while down in the keys.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"As I wrote in the review of the Yankee Freedom boat (only 1 of two ways to get here)...The boat sells out a few days in advance, so look at the long range forecast and make your best guess if visiting down here. Yes, it is expensive to get here. I simply cannot believe that a place like this exists in the US. Its that amazing/unspoiled. There aren't guardrails, elevators, or people holding your hand the whole time. They are letting it crumble, and that is part of what makes the fort so darn interesting. The place is full of history if you are so inclined, not to mention just walking the walls and letting your imagination run wild.The snorkeling was ok. Tons and tons of fish, everywhere you look. But the corals are all dead that we saw, but we stayed close to the wall. Watch out for jellyfish, but if its a calm day, they can be just as beautiful to watch as anything else in the water. Didn't see any sharks, but some barracuda. Lots of people in the water, and it was generally only around 6 ft deep or less. Walking the moat wall, you can see many of the same things.Overall, it was simply amazing. The views are worth the price of admission.","August 22, 2013",Incredible.,51,"Platte City, Missouri",5

I explained that the price is set at the level that is suitable for the adventure and he should not turn it down by that account. I ended up going to the island by myself and it was great! The boat staff and tour guides are all so nice and helpful. I would recommend this trip to everyone that goes to Key West. It is a hidden gem with a wait list. So make sure you book ASAP.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"DONT GO!! We took the ferry out at almost 165$ a person for adults this was a huge waste of money. I will say the boat ride and food are fine except on the way back they have a 20 min video and that's it. Nothing like having a spare DVD to entertain your guests on the ride back I suggest some planet earth or a cheesy animate comedy like finding nemo. On to the park. First thing they ""forget"" to mention is all the jelly fish during the summer months are floating around the islands. But oh to late you already paid 165 and the boat has left port. The place was crawling with jelly fish and they may not be poisonous but they do sting so watch out for your little ones. If you come for the history read about it online and save your self the money cause the fort is a giant empty circle with some nice views. Why we are spending all this money to restore it to, only to most likely have a hurricane wipe it out is a big waste of time. The snorkeling is GARBAGE!! the reef is dead. We saw a few fish and a few nice bits of coral but not 165$ worth that's for sure. I saw no signs of them trying to restore the reef either. I paid 35$ for another snorkel tour the following day and it blew the dry tortugas out of the water. Go walk around the docks and sign up for one of those tours, then take your remaining money take your self and the misses out to a nice dinner at the commodore then go for drinks and ice cream after and you can still have money left over for the next day for a big breakfast.

We saw squid, jacks, goliath grouper, jellyfish and the Dory fish from Nemo... lots of coral and the water was super clear and a beautiful color grean.They say there is a crocodile that got swept off course during a hurricane and just hangs around the island - some people see him but he never bothers anyone - we didn't see him ... whew!It was a nice relaxing and fun day!","August 19, 2013",Snorkling was fun,2,"Key West, United States",5

On the way out we were buzzed by a navy jet,saw flying fish,and a couple of turtles. Coming back in we saw a water spout and a hammerhead shark. The breakfast was fresh and the coffee was hot. For lunch we made our sandwiches on the boat and took they out to a picnic table on the beach. Snorkeling around the base of the fort was the best snorkeling in the keys.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"From the boat ride out to the fort, the tour, and the snorkeling, there was nothing I didn't love about this trip. The construction of this fort back in the 1800's boggles the mind on how much work and effort went into it. The beautiful fish and coral just off the shore make me wish I had a underwater camera. Everyone should take a day trip here.","August 11, 2013",BEST.DAY.TRIP.EVER,35,"Greenville, South Carolina",5

The water and scenery was just amazing and to see the fort there was unlike anything you've ever seen. You're free to roam at your leisure with no defined schedule. If you'd like there is a formal tour of the fort shortly upon arrival or you can tour independently as we did. The island is also big enough that when you're exploring its not crowded at all.The boat trip is as described so beware if you get motion sick like I do. I took medicine the night before and before each leg of the trip. I didn't get sick luckily but the trip back was rough. The downstairs cabin is air conditioned luckily and rest assured, you're not the only one feeling the pain.","August 10, 2013","Unlike anything you've ever seen, must see",4,"Austin, Texas",5

We got off the boat and pretty much had the ability to tour the site or hop in the water. I liked how my experience was provided on a voluntary basis; that is, if I wanted to do my own thing, that was fine. We went up on the top and it seemed like you could see for miles around. All you could see was water. It was beautiful. What I disliked was having to leave. I heard that you can camp there but it takes forever to get in line. Too bad, it would be really nice.","August 9, 2013",Wow! This was great!,1,"Gainesville, Florida",5

The staff on the boat was great and the food was plentiful. You can bring your our snacks if you want. The snorkeling was fun and there is lots of sea life to see.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our family splurged on this trip for our vacation/50th b-day celebration. Because was a bit on the pricey side (you think?) was a bit nervous but then we figured cost was no more than a day at Disney so we made our reservation. Best decision we have made all summer long, the Dry Tortugas were just straight up fabulous! The ship (Yankee Freedom) was uber clean & modern and the staff were super friendly. Breakfast & lunch (both included) were pretty good and served up in an efficient & expedient manner. The morning started at 7:15. We boarded at 7:30 and were on our way at 8am sharp. Breakfast was nothing fancy but substantial enough. Buffet style and included bagels, cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, grapes, dry cereal, milk, O.J., coffee and sliced ham. We docked at Fort Jefferson at 10:30. Being as it was Aug 2 and not a cloud in the sky, it was HOT. So we toured the Fort right away. Can't say how the guided tour was, we did the self guided, bringing along the brochure they made available to anyone who wanted it. Took us about 30 minutes and we should have taken longer but it really was hot and frankly we just wanted to hit the water. Considering that we did the ""speedy"" version we still felt we covered enough and got a real feel for how harsh, lonely but at the same time lovely life here in the 1860's was for both the prisoners & soldiers of the Civil War. After our tour we hit the beach for some spectacular off beach snorkeling! Hot & not a cloud in the sky made for perfect visibility! After snorkeling for an hour we reluctantly got out and went back to the ship for lunch. Again buffet style and frankly a bit better than breakfast. Artisian breads, ham, turkey, tuna salad, potato salad, a lovely fruit salad of apples & strawberries, chips, cookies, assortment of drinks/sodas. After reinforcing ourselves with some yum lunch, back to the beach for some more offshore snorkeling we went. We have snorkeled plenty; Grand Cayman, Bahamas, Looe Key and snorkeling, Dry Tortugas is right up there with the best of them! We saw a nurse shark, bahama starfish, sand dollars, queen conch, parrot fish, barracuda and loads of juvenile tropical fish in the grass beds/coral. One of the cool things was swimming with the mullet! Happened twice, we were just surrounded by millions of them and were able to direct fish traffic with our hands, was def a highlight. The reefs are smaller here compared to Looe Key but also shallower so this is excellent for the littles who might not be able to jump off a boat or the beginner snorkeler. At 3:30 and a bit reluctantly we headed back to the boat and by 3:45 we were on our way ""home"" back to KW. At this point snacks and drinks including beer and wine were available for $ so if you were hungry/thirsty you could grab those. This was a trip of a lifetime and we were so thrilled we were able to do it!","August 4, 2013",So glad we did it!,60,"Merritt Island, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Found out about this wonderful tourist destination from a friend. It costs $165 per person, but it is worth every penny. The ferry is operated by the National Park Service -- with the Rangers running the entire operation. You must make reservations in advance in order to get a seat and be at the ferry terminal by 7:15 AM. The ferry leaves by 8:30 AM and you arrive by 10:30 AM. They tell you about the park on the way over and show a snorkeling video. They serve breakfast on the way as well as lunch while you're there. The park rangers will take you on a tour of Fort Jefferson shortly after arrival. Your snorkeling gear is already paid for, so you can skip the tour and go straight to the water if you wish. There is a reef that you need to swim out a little ways to reach. However, if you don't want to swim too far or deal with a current, you can see a lot of fish by swimming along the walls of the fort. The BEST place to see a lot of fish is around the pilings -- you will see more fish there then you will at the reef. I was surrounded by schools of small fish. The store/gift shop is small, but they do sell cheap cameras as well as SD cards (-- I forgot mine). Be sure to wear sunblock! Boat debarks at 2:45 PM and arrives by 5:30 PM.","August 3, 2013",MUST SEE destination,6,"Napa, California, United States",5

Amazing snorkeling and you feel like you are just out here with nothing around. The fort is impressive (and oppressive) at the same time. When you land, instead of staying for lunch, get out and hit the beach, come back through the fort and then get into lunch - you will avoid the crowds this way.

My wife and I had visited often before heading out to the Dry Tortugas, a magical wonderland like no other. Not only will you find a rich history explained by resident park rangers but the snorkeling/diving is miraculous. Glimmering razor fish are so plentiful that you cannot see more than a few feet till you reach out and separate them with your hand as if cutting a silvery cheese. Barracuda, too, will greet you in abundance. Other tropical species reside there, and you might just see the 500 pound grouper that lives under the dock. Frigate birds nest there, seasonally.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a unique trip that you can't do anywhere else, but it is also one of the most expensive things to do on the island. We enjoyed the trip, but I don't think it was worth the price tag.First, if you get the slightest bit seasick, take your dramamine. It is a choppy 2.5 hour ride out on the boat.The boat ride was nice nearing the islands, but other than that it is a quiet, long ride through open water with nothing to see. They serve a continental breakfast and a cold cut sandwich lunch. Once there you can sign up for a 45 minute guided tour which explains he history of the fort but while standing in one spot for most of the time. You are left to explore on your own if you want afterwards.They provide you with snorkeling gear which is nice, but the water was so mirky there wasn't much of anything to see. Maybe it was just our day? Check other reviews on that, but I was very disappointed in what we got to see while snorkeling. They open up a cash bar and sell snacks on the ride back. For the price of the trip, I would think they could afford to include the afternoon tiny bag of chips, but that's just me.I have mixed feelings about this review. It was very different and I got a ton of nice photos, but I doubt I would ever do it again.

The boat served breakfast and lunch (cold buffet for each) which were both fresh and tasty. The one thing that bothered us was that at the end of the trip as we were nearing Key West, the Captain came over the loudspeaker to let everyone know that we should tip the crew because they worked SO hard for us. I'm sorry but at over $150 a person (150+ on board), and with no assistance provided other than setting out food and snorkeling equipment we did not feel that anyone had worked hard enough to tip over and above.

Thus, you should do the full day tour by seaplane if you can afford it, but you should at least get out there by boat if you can.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Please see my review about the Yankee Freedom III, the ferry that brings most visitors to the Dry Tortugas, for details about that–briefly, it's a good service and worth the money to get to this unusual location and historic landmark. You can also take your own boat or charter a seaplane. First, expectations: This is not a cruise stop and not a tourist trap. It's a national park. The portion you're permitted to tour (if you come by ferry) is the ruin of a 19th century fort built on an island not much larger than itself, 70 miles west of Key West. It takes 2.5+ hours to get there. It is hot. There is no phone or internet service. There's not much shade on the beaches. There's no shopping except a little gift shop, and no food, water or restroom facilities except on the ferry (which also serves breakfast and lunch, and which you can return to). But if you like architecture and history, being outside, swimming, snorkeling, birding, photography, great views and/or strange, beautiful out-of-the-way places, you'll probably be very happy with your visit. For the more adventurous, primitive camping is available.Ft. Jefferson is an immense, mostly empty 6-sided building with an open center. The vaults, brickwork, spiral staircases and the moat (yes, an island with a moat) are impressive. You can climb up to the roof/parapet, where you can see the cast iron harbor light and cannons, and get an amazing view of the entire island and the ones nearby. If you don't take the ferry's tour, you can explore on your own using the provided guidebook and signs. You can also walk the path on the moat wall.Snorkeling is allowed in several locations. We felt the best one was the south coal dock ruins, near the ferry dock. Above water, terns, seagulls and pelicans perch on pilings and look down on you from only several feet away. Below, what's left of the structure is the foundation of a sort of artificial reef, crusted with coral and marine plants. The area was packed with fish. Snorkeling along the outer moat wall (you can't swim in the moat itself) is also interesting, because you can observe the activities of baby/juvenile fish and cleaning stations. On a calm, sunny day, the water in the moat and around the fort are beautiful shades of turquoise and blue. The ferry staff can equip you with snorkeling gear if you don't have it.Be sure to use sunscreen, wear a hat and sunglasses, and bring a pre-filled water bottle (at least a liter/quart) to take with you when you leave the ferry–you can also bring small coolers with you. In addition to bottled water for sale, there is a water jug on the ferry, but be polite–it's meant for everyone to share with the meals. Wear good shoes or sport sandals. There are some changing rooms at the dock.","July 19, 2013","Great Architecture, History, Beautiful Scenery, and Good Snorkeling",70,Maryland,5

Jefferson and was reading the reviews posted here to get pumped!I'm disappointed to see that others thought the snorkeling experience was subpar. When my boyfriend and I went, the snorkeling experience was the best we've ever had. People need to understand that it is very weather dependent and if storms had recently been through the area, the clarity might not as you expect. For instance, I loved the Ft. Jefferson experience and was seriously disappointed by Bahia Honda. I saw only a handful of fish there which was a huge contrast to the wildlife I saw at Ft. Jefferson.For us, the Dry Tortugas was some of the clearest water we have ever been in. Be sure to bring lots of sunscreen though. I would suggest a sun-protective shirt if possible. Exploring the fort offers a break from direct sun but for us, we wanted to be in the water for as long as possible. The Yankee Freedom crew was really nice and they have plenty of water aboard so make sure to stay hydrated. The included lunch was good. It wasn't gourmet or anything but it filling and yummy enough.

Most of the coral was dead (best snorkeling was around some old pilings that have become an artificial reef.) There were a few beautiful fish and some barracuda, but the snorkeling at Bahia Honda was much better. It was a great experience and we're glad we went, but we wouldn't go back a second time.","July 10, 2013","Great experience, but don't go for the snorkeling",8,"Oviedo, Florida",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the Yankee Freedom ferry to this unique, fascinating & gorgeous destination. It combines a 5 hour plus boat excursion, a top-notch guided tour of historic Fort Jefferson, & uncrowded, pristine beaches with fine snorkeling. The generous buffet breakfast & lunch served were very basic fare that was fresh & tasty with plenty of healthy choices. Really fine bagels in the morning, but lunch dessert cookies should be upgraded. Appreciated the snorkel gear & fresh water showers furnished. The ferry crew was completely professional but also extremely congenial, well-informed about the voyage & all aspects of the destination, & willing to share their knowledge. We rode outside going which meant eating without a table; coming back those sitting there got lots of hot sun & a brief rainstorm. We ate lunch inside the air-conditioned main cabin. On the return voyage, we opted for the smaller upper indoor cabin where a group of 10 started drinking as soon as the bar there opened & until it closed. They were not obscene or inappropriate but VERY loud & frequently moving. The gals were actually rowdier than the guys. We eventually fell asleep for a while, so It didn't bother us enough to move downstairs. At that time it would have been a challenge to find a place together. . The crew had stressed that passengers should not take up extra seats; I'm sure they would have found us seating if requested. Best advice is to board early. We have no regrets about the cost. It is a rare national park unlike others. The value is good for a full day of safe, worthwhile experiences on the sea with meals compared to many commercial tourist activities. And seniors who are active but have back issues do better on boats like this! It was as cheap for us to take a taxi from our B & B as to use the all-day parking lot. The terminal itself is quite nice, & everyone from the check-in person on acted happy to have us on the trip.","July 4, 2013",Awesome day of nature & history away from it all!,16,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I cannot say how much my husband and I enjoyed this trip. We took the Yankee Freedom Ferry over to the island. The crew was very friendly and breakfast was nice since we had to be there at 6:30 am. 2.5 hr boat ride over with a little rain (whic was nice( everyone cleared the deck except for us and another couple. Campgrounds are first come first serve so make sure the person who goes with the ranger to the campground walks fast. My husband went and got there first and we were able to score the best campite under the trees! We camped for 3 nights under then most amazing starry skies. After the boat leaves, there will be very few campers allowing an almost desolate island.Yes there was occasional nightly stomrs but just bring a tarp you will be ok. Snokeling was the best I have ever done. Every trip was a different experience. I couldn't imagine only taking a day trip for a few hours. You definetly need a days to soak it all in including Fort Jefferson. Fihing from the dock was pretty good. My husband caught a goliath grouper (had to be returned as it is a protected species. I also caught a tarpon from the dock and snapper dinner for the last 2 nights. I could have stocked the cooler with 50 or 60 of them, as I caught that many.If your looking for a fun few days in the keys away from all the hustle in bustle, this is the place.","July 2, 2013",Most amazing camping trip and snorkeling ever!!!!!,16,"Inverness, Florida",5

The crew does a good job and the food they serve is pretty good.The history of the place is just amazing. We took the guided tour and were so glad that we had. My husband and teenage daughter are both intrigued by history so they truly enjoyed it. The snorkeling was very good! We saw stingrays and massive schools of fish and a big ole grouper.

The views of the sea and its inhabitants was breathtaking. The island itself offers a history walk around Fort Jefferson and clear waters for swimming and snorkeling.

There are changing rooms availale. The scenery is breath taking. Really beautiful. Beware, those of you who have kids, they serve alcoholic beverages on the way back. The boat becomes really small when people have had too much to drink. Then your options are go outside or put up with people who have no idea how loud and obnoxious they've become. It's a worthwhile trip but its expensive. The crew was awesome. I really can't say enough about them. If not for the drunks aboard I would have gone 4 stars.

Once you get to island you can explore Fort Jefferson, enjoy the beaches and wildlife or snorkle. We spent most of our time snorkeling (our first time). The beaches and waters surrounding the fort are very friendly for those who are new at snorkeling but also offer exiting opportunities for those with more experience. We did snorkle along the walls of the fort and saw beautiful fishes, octopuses, rays and corals among other things. The waters aren't that deep so you feel quite safe while swimming in the ocean.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Get up early and catch the Yankee Freedom ferry (leaves Key West about 7:45 a.m. and returns at 5:30 p.m.) for the 2.5 hour trip to this almost deserted island. The island is dominated by the large fort/prison used before during and after the Civil War. There are guided ranger tours of the fort, but the self-guided tour using the brochure available on the boat is even better. After the tour, cool off by snorkeling in the beautiful waters around the island. We saw squid, lots of colorful fish and a 4-foot barracuda right in front of us. In the moat around the fort, a 6-foot salt water crocodile has taken up residence.The ferry provides coffee, water, soft drinks, breakfast and lunch as part of your ticket. They also provide the snorkeling gear. All you need to bring is your swimsuit, a towel, a hat (not much shade is available) and your camera. If you are prone to sea sickness, take a Bonine tablet before the trip and you'll be fine. The large ferry's ride is pretty smooth and the boat itself is new and comfortable. A bonus if you are a nature lover and go in the summer is that 100,000 sooty terns nest on Bush Island right next to the national park. It is their only nesting place in the US and they are a sight to see.","June 26, 2013",Adventure-filled Day,43,"Amarillo, Texas",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Traveled here with my mother on the Yankee Freedom II. The fort is absolutely breathtaking. You can go to the top of the fort, walk it's perimeter and look out over to the oceans and other islands. Although it was very hot and humid, but worth every drop of sweat. For snorkeling, I must admit I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews and I was a bit disappointed. There isn't much coral that I could find (such as in Key Largo, Looe Key or Sombrero Lighthouse), but the life is diverse and colorful. There are three places they tell you to snorkel, there are the old docks which have coral and growth on them will a lot of little fish life, the moat wall (which we both thought was the best) and there is another spot they say you have to swim along the first moat all almost all the way to the buoy, then take an immediate right and the coral heads should be there. I swam for at least 1.5 hours looking for the coral heads and I was unable to find them. We saw the normal parrot fish, barracuda and other smaller, colorful fish. There was a large lobster hiding under a fallen rectangular cement piece. Closer along the shore line there were several small squid. For a beginner snorkeler and kids, this would be quite the experience! The Yankee Freedom offers a free lunch while you're there from 11-1 I believe, but we were so busy snorkeling and exploring we didn't have time. If you do miss the lunch they sell other foods and drinks on the way back to Key West. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience even though I had been expecting a little more, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a day out in the middle of the ocean!","June 22, 2013",Good day trip away from the busy island,7,Marysville,4

Jefferson for a wonderful visit.During my visit at Ft. Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas, I toured the fort, saw lots of wildlife including the most birds I have seen since the Alfred Hitchcock thriller ""The Birds"". Tame doves ate some of my snack crackers off of the picnic table, fish in the moat hovered around hoping for some crumbs to fall their way, and there were some beautiful pelicans and seagulls.The park rangers were very friendly and informative, the gift shop had some nice souvenirs and the getting to climb all over the fort was very enjoyable and informative.

I noticed quite a few people dozing...maybe they had taken motion sickness meds, but the boat is very large and I think most people won't be bothered much by sea-sickness. The water is beautiful and Garden Key, where you will land, offers snorkeling and the historical Fort Jefferson.

We took a sandwich with us to get us through the lunch hour, and accepted the charter's cooler of free water and soft drinks as there is no food or drink on the island. We went snorkeling after walking the fort and didn't find it too diverse, maybe a time of year issue? Got a few ""sea lice"" bites on my arm and face, hubby got several on his body.

However, I am so glad I listened to my wife and took this trip. This was one of the neatest tours I have ever been on in my life. I cannot put into words how awesome this fort was. The sheer size is breathtaking. When you add in a day of top notch snorkeling at the fort, it is just a truly memorable trip. The staff aboard the Yankee Freedom was great. They provided us with a complimentary tour, which led by a wonderful and knowledgable staff member.","June 13, 2013",Great trip,25,"Anna, Illinois",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,My boyfriend and I took the ferry out for two nights of camping. We got in a great afternoon of snorkeling after setting up camp. The wind increased so much overnight that it was unsafe to snorkel the rest of our trip but we explored the Fort from top to bottom and read every sign! So cool!! I highly recommend camping because once the ferry leaves it feels like your own private island to explore. ,"June 12, 2013",Great few days away from Key West,9,"Ketchikan, Alaska",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wow! This place was AMAZING! A really remote island; so beautiful. We went by sea plane, which was a really fun experience. My family spent hours and hours snorkeling, because the reef was so cool. The fort itself was really neat and informative. The best part- the island is NEVER crowded! Only one ferry-full and two small planes-full are there at a time. This place really made our trip to Key West.

(Wait until you get back to Key West...the schooner wharf is right down the street) Once at Dry Tortugas; We stayed for part of the fort tour; but lunch on the boat and an afternoon of snorkeling was our plan.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was actually my second trip there in ten years. The 2 1/2 hour ride to and from the park on the brand new ferry was spectacular, and the 4 hours on the island seemed like it went by in an instant. Our group spotted several very large loggerhead turtles and the color of the water changes with the time of day. The crew was phenomenal, and they put on a very nice continental breakfast and a satisfying lunch that was available for two hours. I liked the fact that you could eat at your leisure. Water was available all day for no extra charge. Words cannot describe the environment that awaits you, so I wont even bother....just go. This is a once in a lifetime trip for most and the cost is justified. I had to laugh at some of the negative reviews...I don't know where these people thought they were going. A few warnings...if you can't part with your smartphone for a few hours DONT GO...if you expect shopping DONT GO...if you think you are going to a tropical resort DONT GO...if you don't want a long boat ride DONT GO. If you want to experience one of the most pristine areas left in the United States then this trip should be added to your ""bucket list""! The weatherman was calling for torrential rains all day long on the day of our trip (the flooded streets were eveidence upon our return) but the crew stated that the weather on the Turtugas,70 miles out into the ocean, would be partly cloudy and beautiful, as it usually is. They nailed it!

A bit pricey and our college kids were skeptical but decided to give it a try. What a great time we had!! The trip provided two better-than-expected meals, a full breakfast and lunch, arranged by professional and knowledgable staff. We arrived at the island a little over 2 hours from the time we left and participated in the 45 minute tour of Fort Jefferson. Lots of great history and the tour guide knew his stuff! He allowed plenty of time for questions. Worthwhile to go and learn about the fort and the island. We then returned to the boat for lunch and to get snorkel equipment. We spent the next few hours snorkeling after some brief instructions by the staff. What an experience!! This was the first time our kids have gone snorkeling and they were blown away!!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This was an excellent day trip. We departed Key West on the Yankee Freedom III at 8:00 AM and arrived back in port around 5:30 PM. Long day, but so worth it. Come prepared though! You do have 2 and a half hours to kill on the boat each way. Good for napping or reading. The food offered by boat is eh. I'd suggest to bring some yummy homemade sandwhiches and snacks in a cooler. Also, bring an umbrella for the island. Should you have a clear sunny day like we did, hanging out by the beach is hard to do with the sun beating down on you. The snorkleing was WONDERFUL! Just be sure to check out the snorkling areas by the former piers, thats where you will see the most types of fish. Make good use of your snorkling time and focus on the areas that matter. Oh and WEAR SUNBLOCK ON YOUR BACK & BACK LEGS!! I missed the tour of the fort in order to take advantage of more snorkling, which I was OK with. Instead, we did a short, self-guided tour of the fort after we ate lunch before jumping back in the water.The staff on the Yankee Freedom was great.

If u take the ferry & even remotely prone to sea sickness/motion sickness, take some Dramamine as a preventative. Some days there is very little motion from the waves but other days it can be a bit rough if you are prone to that.

Neither can photos. We spent the first hour doing the self guided tour. Then ate lunch and hit the beach. Snorkeling was great. The colorful fish you saw.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We chose the ferry experience instead of the seaplane thinking it would be nice to have a place to use the restroom and get some shade after reading descriptions. The crew was very professional, embarkation and departure were on time, breakfast was better than I expected for a buffet on a ferry, and the ride was pretty smooth. It is long so bring either someone you like talking to for 3 hours or some other entertainment. Once we got there, the water is beautiful and the views from the old fort are magnificent. I do wish I had known 3 things - 1. The snorkeling is not that impressive if you have been to Hawaii, further south in the Caribbean, etc.. I am admittedly ""spoiled"" for Florida snorkeling after some other places I've been but the colors are less spectacular here than expected despite a sunny day and clear water. Had I known this I might not have brought a dive skin and my own equipment to lug around. 2. There IS shade on the island and a lot of it! Several things I read led me to expect nowhere to get out of the sun all day, so I brought a beach tent for shade and ended up carrying that around, too. At the beach there are some trees for a little shade but if you want to get out of the sun there are tons of cool, shady areas in the old fort. And, finally, #3: bring the good camera. I brought my little pocket camera instead of the expensive one due to the expectation of this desolate place with no shade, sand blowing into everything, and crowds of people. It wasn't like that at all so bring a good camera to capture the gorgeous colors of the water from the fort. The trip back was long but they showed a cute movie (""The Big Year"") that I didn't expect to enjoy, but did. I have read about a lot of seasickness on the ferry in TA but I only saw a couple of folks who weren't doing well on the day we went and the crew was attending to them well.","May 18, 2013",Unique Experience - Worth the Trip,6,,4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Looking for something a little off the beaten path? The Dry Tortugas National Park, a mere 70 miles west of Key West in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico is an excellent place to visit. One of the least visited National Parks due to its difficult to reach location, this is a great place to spend some time. There are 3 options for reaching the park. The first is by private plane, which can be a bit pricey, but is the fastest choice. The second is by private boat, which is cheaper, but can be pricey if you don't actually own the boat. The last option which we opted for, was to take a private ferry, the Yankee Freedom III, which makes daily trips and allows you to spend 4 hours on the island. The trip itself takes about 2 hours, 15 minutes each way, but is well worth it. You even get breakfast and lunch included, and the boat comes with multiple bathrooms for the passengers. The seats are comfortable and the crew is pleasant and knowledgeable. During your time on the island, you can explore the old Fort Jefferson, spend time lounging on two beautiful beaches and go snorkeling (snorkeling gear included in the price of the ferry). This is definitely worth the trip (and the requirement that you wake up super early in the morning to be there for the 7:30 AM boarding time).","May 12, 2013",Top notch day!,297,"Lansdale, Pennsylvania",5

Announcements were made about various islands that we cruised past, making the trip pass very quickly. Snorkel gar was available and if there were problems, gear was switched out quickly. Clear, warm and wonderful water, lots of fish to see, coral to explore and just a great adventure! Do not have to be a strong swimmer, just willing t float, if you want!

There were a few people camping but there are only 4-5 spots where you can set up and have tree cover; some were set up in direct sun, I couldn't imagine staying there without tree cover in the summer. We took a seaplane to get there; it cost $280.00 pp and took 40 minutes. The boat cost in the mid hundreds but takes over 1.5 hours each way. It was worth the xtra money to not spend half the day on a boat.

The breakfast & lunch that were a part of the boat ticket were satisfactory. I was grateful for all of the coffee after a late night out in Key West prior to the trip!As far as the actual Fort Jefferson / Dry Tortugas National Park experience goes -- it is something that I will always remember, despite the fact the weather was overcast & the high temp only hit 72 that day. I was super disappointed that the water was so cloudy because we weren't able to enjoy snorkeling as much as I'd hoped, but the fort itself is so cool & you do need a couple of hours to explore every nook & cranny. Even without the snorkeling & doing a self-guided tour, the trip would have been worthwhile. To be sitting in the middle of the ocean on an old naval fort is a completely unique experience. The next time I go back, I hope I can take advantage of the snorkeling more!","May 9, 2013",A bucket list trip!,3,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Only way to get there is by boat or seaplane (we took the boat --- $$ fee) --- but worth the trip. We've been to other seacoast forts (Ft. Monroe, Ft. Sumter, Ft. Pulaski) but Ft. Jefferson at Dry Tortugas is definitely one of the more unique outposts of the Civil War. Beautiful waters, many birds, and brilliant, sunny, vistas from any of casemates at the Fort. A strange solitude lingers at the place where the Lincoln assassination conspirators (e.g., Dr. Samuel Mudd) were held after the Civil War. Small beach with snorkeling allowed.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Undoubtedly the Dry Tortugas is one of the finest features in our country and certainly of the Keys. We flew. The opportunity to see the area by Seaplane takes u away with a better prospective of the region. What we did find is that most of the people on the ferry regretted not flying . 2 hours on the island is not enough time. It's just not! U will end up comprising something u want to do because of it. Save up and fly. Treat it like a bucket list item. It fills the bill. Don't go all that way and not have the most of u r experience. Stay the whole day too! The other fliers who did not book the entire day regretted this also. Some helping information in planning your trip: 1. The webcam underwater is right under the dock where the ferry comes in so you can't swim/snorkel to it.2. When u get off the plane or ferry facing the fort go to the left for one of the 2 beach excess points. The pilings on this side are a better snorkel than next to the ferry.3. The 9ft Crock is also on this side of the moat. He will be hiding by the drainage pipes under the wooden planks. 4. Some things to think about brining are: Under water disposable camera, shelter from the sun, lip balm with SPF (salt trashes u r lips snorkeling ) water to rinse off with( at least enough for u r face), cooler, and bring a camera into the fort( best pics are from windows). Also anti-fog solution for snorkels masks would have been helpful. Be prepaid to be bummed out when u leave. Yes, it's that special!","May 8, 2013",Make the most of u r day.

It is pricier but so worth it because you get to see all the sea turtles and marine life overhead while the pilot narrated the history. We went at the end of the day, so the ferry was already on its way back to Key West and we had the island all to ourselves. We snorkeled and even saw a waterspout during a brief rain shower.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"32 years ago, my dad scheduled a trip to the Dry Tortugas for he and I to visit together. When we arrived in Key West, the weather was bad, and the trip got cancelled. It was a severe disappointment, and I have wanted to go back there ever since. Finally, this spring I grabbed the chance, and it was an incredible feeling arriving back in Key West in perfect weather, knowing that such a long-term desire was about to be fulfilled. Well, I wasn't disappointed. I boarded the Yankee Freedom, a very nice vessel with a wonderfully friendly crew, on the morning of a perfect day. The water was beautiful and I enjoyed staying out in the warm sunshine for the 2 1/2 hour trip out to Dry Tortugas, watching for turtles, dolphins, flying fish, birds, etc, along the way. It was a thrill seeing the approaching island with Ft Jefferson's commanding presence and the beauty of the water -- with seabirds flying all around the boat. The Fort itself was extremely interesting, but I was mainly there to enjoy the unique bird species that can only be found around the Dry Tortugas (for the U.S.) and the migrating birds passing through, that seem to drop into the trees out of thin air. It was an amazing experience, and I saw almost every bird I came for, plus a lot of my favorite birds from the Eastern U.S., which I normally don't get to see (being a Westerner). The trip back was great to just relax and enjoy the company of other travelers who also were happy with their Dry Tortugas adventure that day. I'm so glad I finally did this! It was great getting to check the Dry Tortugas off my bucket list!","April 29, 2013",This was on my Bucket List,3,Idaho,5

The snorkel gear provided was clean and in good shape. The assistant made sure you had gear that fit and worked properly. Several areas to snorkel and it was a wonderful snorkeling adventure.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I have a confession to make: I never even went inside the fort....I've been to quite a few Forts over the years, and I'm a water baby. My purpose for visiting was to snorkel...and that I did. Only complaint? Not long enough, and I was in the water for a good 3 hours.I took the Yankee Freedom with my sister, and only made reservations two days in advance (sold out for day before). The crew were fantastic, breakfast & lunch included. Well worth the $. If you want to make the most of your time in the water, bring your own equipment, drop your stuff on the south beach, and make your way around the base of the Fort. Get out and apply more sunscreen, eat lunch, and head back in the water either to the coral heads directly off the left point of the base on the south side, or to the coal pilings. Warning pilings are for strong swimmers & experienced snorkel ears only. Be careful of the currents. Although I've seen more variety and quantity of fish elsewhere, the quality of coral and sea fans was unmatched. Ran into 5 different barracuda along the way.Next time, I'm bringing my husband, and spending the night.

If you want to get there see it and go back to key west quickly, take the 35 min seaplane. But you are on your own with the seaplane, there is no tour according to the people I spoke to. There is no ranger at the facility that gives tours.It is mostly visited by bird lovers. There will be a flock of birders on your boat-ride but they are entertaining in their own right. ;)The snorkeling is very good as well. The water is a little cooler than the keys but you are 70 miles west of key west in open ocean. (water temp was mid 70's) visibility was a little cloudy but you see millions of fish of all sizes...(really!)The boat ride is very well run and the staff is very knowledgeable and professional.It is a full day trip. leave at 7am get back at 5pm with 5 hours of travel.

It was as wonderful as hoped for- even though the weather was iffy. The snorkeling is other-worldly (bring a wetsuit unless you are way tougher than me), the stars touch the horizon, the birds are great, and just being on a tiny speck of land 70 miles from anywhere is a hard to duplicate experience. This is the easiest remote camping in the world. You take a boat, there are wheeled carts to get to campsites, there are toilets, but once the boat leaves, it is just you, a few other campers, and the stars, the terns, the hermit crabs, migratory songbirds, hammerhead sharks, barracudas, and all the other amazing things that are so often missed/ignored/etc. Only one of us saw a rat (and they are palm rats, not Norway rats)...but why am I writing this?

Beyond, the sea floor dropped away and there were barracuda? looming out in the deep blue. We returned to the fort to explore inside, some interesting history there.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Took the ferry out to Dry Tortugas. It was rather expensive, but it was a long trip, 2.5 hours each way, making this an all-day activity. Food was part of the fare, but it was what it was. Not thrilled that one had to purchase bottled water. As we were planning the trip, I noticed that each day we waited to book, the further out the available days went, so pick a date and book your ticket at least a week in advance. You can cancel I think 24-48 hours. The ride back was a bit bumpy, so if you get motion sickness then be prepared with some Dramamine, which they also sell ($1). We skipped the fort tour, just walked the wall around the moat. There are 2 small beaches for getting into the water for swimming or snorkeling, we used the south beach, the north beach looked rather rocky. The best snorkling was around the left side of the beach towards the docks, where some old pilings hosted a fabulous diveristy of healthy and colorful coral, purple fan coral, brain coral, staghorn coral, etc, and an accompanying riches of fishies. Was really fabulous, snorkling through the pilings, like another world entirely, really awsome. The water was a bit cool, but at 70, was warmer than around Key West (at 65), but not bathtub warm like in the USVI or Barbados. But the water was heavenly shades of blue, and very clear. We packed our own lunch and picniced on the beach, took a short nap, and then went snorking again. Almost missed the boat back. This was the best day of our vacation, it was so beautiful, and remote, and not a whole lot of people. Really, out in the middle of nowhere, just relax and have some fun. And, yes, there's a huge brick-walled 19th century fort that takes up most of the island, if fort exploring is your thing. And a small landbridge to a smaller island that was host to many many birds, but it was off-limits. There was a constant cacophany and scrum going on over there, that I would expect a birder with glasses would really enjoy.","April 5, 2013","Best snorkeling in America, other than USVI",3,"Medford, MA",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Wilie getting out to the Dry Tortugas via the Yankee Freedom is not cheap, it is certainly a place you should consider putting on your itinerary if you are spending some time in the Keys. It has both the historical aspects, as well as the environmental interests. You can lounge on some nice beaches, look at the birds, or, best of all, go snorkeling. We say barracuda, a shoal of shrimp, some (very large) lobsters, tarpon and a range of the more normal sea life. Probably the best snorkeling we have done in Florida, though that is not extensive.The Yankee Freedom folks hand out comment cards on the way back to get feedback. That motivated our family to confer about what they could do better, and to be honest, not much. They really do it well. The most substantive comment was that they could have a second fort tour towards the end of the visit. It would also be great if they could add another hour on the island, but not add an hour to the whole trip, i.e., reduce the boat trip time. It is not that the boat trip is unpleasant, it is just that there is limited time.","March 26, 2013","Very nice trip, Yankee Freedom does it very well (though not cheap).",88,"Atlanta, GA",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped here for 3 days and 2 nights. If you love primative camping, being away from the crowds, and bonding with nature and family, don't miss the chance to see this wonderful National Park. We rented double kayaks and brought them along on the ferry with all our food and camp gear. There is no water or electricity for campers so planning well is a must to the trip success. After the day tourists leave the island and return to Key West on the ferry, campers have the island to themselves. We kayaked, snorkeled, gazed at stars, took sunset photos, explored the fort, and enjoyed the beach. My only regret is that we did not book 3 nights instead of 2.

The morning of, we were informed that the seas were a bit rough and choppy and we were offered Dramamine for sale. We asked about the snorkelling and were told it was still a go. If we cancelled there would be no refund. After an extremely unpleasant 2 hours (people were throwing up all over the ship - luckily we did not) we arrived at the Park, were given an interesting tour of the Fort (30 Mins) and then sat there for the rest of the day as the snorkelling was a bust because of the wind and waves.

The ride was 2 hours each way and they gave us plenty of time to explore the fort, eat, swim/snorkel, etc. Lots of interesting history of the fort (it was really hot when we went), but we cooled off at the beach where my sister was stung by a jellyfish.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I have been to the keys many times but this was the first time I visited Dry Tortugas. I am going to try and give a thorough account/review of my trip to help travelers decide if this trip is something that will be worth it to them...so here we go....First and foremost...taking a seaplane to Dry Tortugas is the most expensive, interesting, convenient way to tackle this excursion. I took the 1/2 day tour and it cost $280...whereas a 1/2 day excursion via the ferry costs approximately $165. That makes for a difference of $115 dollars. Here is where YOU can decide which option, if either, is most appealing to you and your budget....To reach by Dry Tortugas via the ferry takes 2hrs each way. To reach Dry Tortugas via a seaplane takes 40mins each way. What that translates to is nearly 3 extra hours of time you get to spend snorkeling, taking pictures, touring the fort, etc. If you take the seaplane that leaves at 2pm...you literally land at Dry Tortugas when the herd of 150+ people are leaving the island via the ferry. This means that you will literally have the place to yourself! I believe there was approximately 30 people on the island while I was there compared to 200+ if you take the ferry. I was also literally the ONLY person snorkeling...which was quite nice as well. If you elect to take the seaplane, you will see a birds-eye view of the keys that you cannot see in any other way! You only fly about 500ft above the water and you can literally see sharks, stingrays, and manatees swimming in the water below. You will also see various island formations, ever-changing water colors, shipwrecks, etc. I have never taken off/landed on the water in a plane before and that also sold me. Due to all the reasons I listed above....the extra $115 dollars was worth it to ME. As far as the actual fort is concerned, it is a mixed bag. What I liked most about the actual fort is that you can literally explore every inch of it including walking on the top wall which gives you an AMAZING view for taking pictures and taking in the ridiculously gorgeous scenery. There isn't all that much to actually see/do in the fort...but Dry Tortugas isn't about the fort in my opinion. Dry Tortugas is all about the insanely pretty water, landscapes, snorkeling, picture-taking, and exploring. Scenery is the main attraction of Dry Tortugas. As far as the snorkeling is concerned, you are completely free to snorkel wherever you want for however long you want. You won't have a guide or anything like that and there are shallow areas and deep areas to snorkel. There is tons of coral and fish to view. You can also explore the underwater fort walls, caves, etc. I got to admit that snorkeling myself was a bit unnerving because the keys is FULL of crazy aquatic life and I know how infested the florida keys are with sharks and this played with my mind a bit. I saw a barracuda that was longer and thicker than my own body and out of nowhere I saw a gigantic manta ray (HUGE specie of sting ray) gliding away into the abyss. You will DEFINITELY see a wide array of aquatic life while snorkeling and you can stick to a beginner experience if you would like or if you are more daring/experienced you can venture further out into the abyss where I guarantee you will see something crazy!In addition to snorkeling, there is a very small, yet beautifully serene ""beach"" (quotes used to imply how small the ""beach"" truly is...but it IS a beach). You could enjoy a nice picnic on the beach, suntan, play in the crystal clear ice blue calm waters, etc. There is a small gift shop at the fort but you will need to bring your own food and drinks as none of these items can be purchased at Dry Tortugas. The essentials you should bring are a camera, sunscreen, snacks/drinks, bathing suit, snorkel gear, and a towel. If the cost of getting to Dry Tortugas isn't off-putting to you and if it doesn't put a significant dent in your budget...I would say the trip is entirely worth it if you enjoy the things that I have mentioned above. Cheers!","March 18, 2013",Off The Mainland Beaten Path...,120,"Los Angeles, California",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"A group of six of us went off season (recommended), it was a long three hour boat ride out there, but they serve a continental breakfast and had plenty of room to stretch out and nap. When we arrived, we had to remove all our possessions from the boat and park them on the beach area, you could tour the prison, snorkel, lounge on the beach at this point. We opted for the guided tour, which I recommend, our tour guide was informative and humorous. This lasted about an hour. There was a deli style lunch available back on the boat, so after we wandered around the prison a little more we went and ate lunch. From here we took our cooler and blankets and spread out on the beach. The day was quite warm, but the water was wonderful. Part of group opted to snorkel, while the rest of us sat about waist deep in the water and chatted the afternoon away. We walked around the prison on this brick path that was in the water and could watch other people snorkel and could see fish. they allow you to bring your own coolers full of refreshments. They also have a cash bar on the return trip. It is a little pricey, but since we are locals, go a good discount. It is very worth the price to go, but I couldn't imagine being out there if our boat had been full (as it was maybe at 1/3 capacity).

The weather was gorgeous. The tour guide crew, with Michael leading the way, were friendly, knowledgeable, approachable and went out of there way to answer questions and accomodate everyone.The meals, breakfast and lunch, were perfect.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Some reviews are negative about the day trip from Key West to Dry Tortugas but it was one of our most memorable and fun days. We took the Sunny Days fast catamaran trip which included breakfast on the boat, lunch on the island, soft drinks/water all day, snorkeling equipment, and a guided tour of the fort. The ride was 2 hrs. each way and we had 4:30 hrs. to snorkel, eat and tour. We swam along one whole side of the island and saw lots of beautiful fish. The history of the fort was very interesting and topical as Dr. Mudd who treated John Wilkes Boothe was imprisoned there. I believe the ferry would be too slow and not leave much time to enjoy the island. One of our group gets seaside very easily and cannot snorkel but the catamaran was so fast that even he was fine. The food was not great but it was quite adequate and we liked the all inclusive price. The crew and staff were very helpful and kind. All in all, a very fun day.","March 14, 2013",Enjoyable day trip to snorkel and tour fort,52,"Blacksburg, Virginia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This park is remarkable in so many ways. The convergence of pristine beaches and fascinating historical architecture make this place enchanting. On a calm day, the water is crystal clear. There are some small patches of coral around the outside of the moat, but the best snorkeling is about 50 yards out with large coral heads and tons of fish (they gave out maps on the ferry). The fort itself is a beautiful structure with a very interesting past. The island's isolation also makes it a great place for stargazing. It would make a nice day trip, but to experience everything this park has to offer, you really need to stay overnight. Once the day-trippers clear out, there only a few campers and you have most of the park to yourself. It is primitive camping, so you have to plan carefully and it definitely isn't for everyone. Staying a few nights will give you the best chance of hitting a good day for snorkeling and gives you plenty of time to relax and enjoy this unique location.","March 14, 2013",An amazing experience!,33,"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",5

We took the plane and it was great having this little (and it is little) island to ourselves. You get about 2 hours completely to yourselves with just a few other people. There is some decent snorkeling and some very big fish. We say a big barracuda that likes to sit on the north side. They are territorial so he probably is there often.

Many people snorkeled; I took advantage of the guided tour (Rick our tour guide did a good job and had reseached his material) and then walked around the park to catch a sense of the history and the life of the folks who were there. Saw Dr. Mudd’s cell area, happened to be there on March 11, 2013 – 144 years to the day he walked out of there a free man.Highly recommend the trip.

There is a small visitor center where you can stamp your National Park Passport. The store seems to have limited hours and was closed when I was there. There are a couple of beaches and good snorkeling. Words don't do justice to how beautiful this place is. White sand beaches, turquoise seas, colorful fish and coral. Bring a picnic and beverages.

The trip has a 7:30am departure from the ferry terminal by the Harbor Walk area and returns at around 5:30pm, just in time to enjoy the sunset festivities at Mallory Square. If you are prone to seasickness, plan appropriately since it is a 2 ½ hour ride each way at about 35 mph.The trip includes a breakfast buffet soon after departure and a sandwich bar at lunch while docked at the park. I suggest that you grab extra water at lunch if needed since they charge for it later when the bar opens at 2pm for the ride home.The tour of Fort Jefferson was one hour long and very interesting. Chelsea is a great tour guide! After the tour and lunch, there was plenty of time for lounging on the beach, snorkeling (equipment is included), fishing or bird watching. The beach is nice and clean but I would recommend water shoes since the beach is mostly coral. There is a shower available on the boat to wash any sand or dirt off before the ride home.","February 27, 2013",Very nice day trip,17,"Rochester, Minnesota",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Fort Jefferson is like a dream. Imagine turquoise Bahamian-like waters with an ancient-looking turreted fortress, complete with shark moat, rising on the horizon. We visited by seaplane, and the aerial view is truly unforgettable. You can usually go by boat from Key West, and sometimes from Sugarloaf Key. But go. You'll enjoy the open lawn inside on the parade ground, and walking through dank, low-ceiling passages. The whole place is somewhat spooky, right in the midst of intense tropical paradise surroundings. ","February 25, 2013",Dr. Mudd's prison on a fortified island,124,"Blue Ridge, Georgia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took a sea plane to Dry Tortugas National Park and it was spectacular! We were able to get some great pictures from the plane. Our pilot was nice and gave us a good description of some of the ship wrecks and turtles swimming around in the Atlantic. We took a brief tour of the Prison/Fort and went snorkling around the island. Truly beautiful! The flight was about 35 minutes each way and we spent 2 hours on the island itself. While more expensive that the boat, we didn't have to endure the 2-1/2 boat ride each way! The only drawback was that we only got to spend 2 hours there. We took the 2pm trip so there was only 20 of us on the island between the 2 planes. The boat had just left to head back, so it was nice not having many people around. ","February 24, 2013",Sea Plane to Dry Tortugas,2,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We enjoyed our boat trip to and tour of Fort Jefferson, the most southern and most isolated National Park, where Dr. Mudd and several Lincoln conspirators were held. Found the Fort historically and architecturally interesting as it is probably the best preserved, unmodified 19th century fort in the Country. We had a very good tour guide with the tour, who knew his history and architectural detail well. Beaches and grounds were attractive but we got so involved in touring the fort that we didn't have time to use the free, snorkeling equipment that was available. Maybe next time. Continental breakfast and lunch served on board were adequate. Some of our fellow tourists were unfortunately rude and pushy. ","February 24, 2013",Great Day Trip,10,"Harpers Ferry, West Virginia",5

The water is very clear and there are a lot of fish. We took the seaplane which, while much more expensive, I would recommend over the ferry. The flight is about 40 minutes and provides excellent views of various islands, two sunken ships and, while flying lower, sea life. The flight allows for about 2 1/2 hours on the island.

I have to admit I did not see any sea animals in the water during the flight. They say you might see sharks and turtles, but we did not.The ship wrecks you fly over are 20th century wrecks and disappointing. The flight crew, Evan was great. He told you about the area as you flew over it, but you fly a direct line. Do not expect to circle around the sights as you fly and he talks about it. You are on a direct course to the Tortugas.At the fort the ferry boat was at the dock. We were told to use its resroom facilities if needed. There was no restroom on the Tortugas itself. The ferry becomes the facilty for public use when in dock.My purpose was to take photographs of the fort and I did for over two hours. It is a piece of history and great to walk around. They provide a guided tour of the fort as part of the entry to the facility. It was about 45 minutes.We did not snorkel, but there is an area with a beach and easy access to the snorkel area. Both the ferry and the seaplane provide snorkel gear if you chose to do that. The water was very clear and people said they saw fish.Nice outing and I would recommed it.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We travelled to Dry Tortugas just before Christmas on board of Yankee Freedom II. It was a beautiful day for travel. Clear sky, calm water and temp. in 70s. The national park is very small consisting of 7 islands and we were allowed to go only in the Garden Key where the Fort Jefferson is located. The fort is massive but unfinished. NPS is trying to restore many breaking walls. We took a tour guided by the Yankee Freedom stuff and it was for an hour. After the fort tour we went for snorkeling in one of the beaches in the island.The water was really calm, beach is beautiful without any pollution. Since very few people manages to travel this far, place was like a tiny dream island. Actually there are ~5 NPS rangers stay permanently in the island. Snorkeling was great particularly near the harbor where ancient iron pillars are located. There war corals, star fishes and schools of fishes consisting of thousands of fish. I must have seen ~100 different kind of fish in the couple of hours I did snorkeling. DTNP is only reachable through Yankee Freedom II (can carry ~200 people) or by sea plane. Yankee freedom cost ~$165/ person and they will take care of the breakfast and lunch. There are nothing in the island except a tiny gift shop where you can buy souvenirs and stamp your National park passport. Overall the trip was from morning 7:30 to evening 5:30. On the way back we even saw dolphins and sea turtles swimming in the sea. We were back on time for the beautiful sunset from the Mallory square.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The Yankee Freedom III, a new, high-speed catarmaran, takes you out to Ft. Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas National Park. When you board in the morning, there is a very good buffet breakfast to enjoy while the boat goes 70 miles offshore to the park. You can ride inside in comfortable seats (both up and down) or outside on the deck. Once at the park, you can take a guided tour of Ft. Jefferson (our tour guide was great) and/or go snorkeling. Lunch is served on board at your leisure while docked -- sandwiches, chips, fruit, cookies. The boat leaves around 2:45 pm, so you have a good amount of time on the island to explore, swim or snorkel. The fort is large and its history is very interesting. It contains the cell where Dr. Samuel Mudd was held after he was convicted of helping John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's assassin. On the ride back to Key West, you can buy food and drinks (including alcoholic drinks) to help pass the time. Next time I go, I will definitely bring a book or iPod. The boat gives a comfortable ride, but be aware if you are prone to seasickness. It's about 2 1/2 hours each way.","February 20, 2013",Long boat ride but worth it,79,Maryland,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We were ""caught"" while walking down Duval Street by the trip hawkers. This particular lady was selling trips to the Dry Tortugas and she managed to talk us into the all day trip. We were told that there would be a full breakfast and lunch provided and a guided tour of Fort Jefferson on the island. It is a National Park with no food or water available but they did have an outhouse and usual NP amenities like a visitors center, etc. No ranger led tours were available. According to our instructions we arrived at the pier shortly after 7:00 AM ready to board with two $160 tickets in hand. We were told to park our car in a parking garage that charged $13/day (a bargain in high cost Key West) but due to our not paying attention we ended up parking in the smaller port garage a block closer to the pier for $10/day so one up for us. We boarded the catamaran after spending time in the waiting room after checking in at the window. They did charge us a $4 fuel fee at that time. However since we had a NP pass, we were given $7 back since the park entrance fee had already been collected as part of the initial amount we had paid the day before. Lesson then is to take your NP pass if you have one. Total cost at the checkin window was $3 back to us. We boarded at 7:30 as promised and left the pier at 8:00 AM. The catamaran we were told was brand new having been put into service 12/2012. It certainly was nice. The full breakfast turned out to be cereal, sliced cheese, sliced ham, bread and OJ/coffee. It was served shortly after we left port. Lunch served on the boat was sandwiches which you made yourself from different types of cold cuts and cheeses. Soda pop was provided during lunch both full and diet. Water was available all the time from a 5 gallon container. They sold snacks, beer, fu fu drinks (adult), etc., during the trip back to Key West. They divided us into two groups who wanted to take a tour of the fort led by two crew members. Ours, Mike, was really good in describing the fort, guiding us around and answering all questions. The tour was about one hour although they advertised it as 45 minutes. The tour was not mandatory and quite a few skipped it. Since I am a diver and my partner does not dive or snorkel, we skipped this part but it did look inviting. The boat provides the snorkel equipment if you did not bring yours. The fort was awesome although it was never totally completed. It was used during the civil war to house union soldiers who had broken the rules and later as a fueling station for the US Navy operating in the Caribbean. The highlite though was seeing the cell where they kept Dr Samuel Mudd who had treated Booth's leg fracture after assassinating President Lincoln. He was there about 4 years before being pardoned by President Johnson shortly before leaving office. I would highly recommend this trip.","February 18, 2013",fantastic trip,80,"San Antonio, Texas",4

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This site is historically, militarily and culturally fascinating and is a must see when visiting Key West. Breakfast and lunch are included in the fee, but any afternoon snacks on the return leg need to be purchased. Our tour guide for Fort Jefferson, Chelsea, was very knowledgeable about the history of the Fort, going into compelling details about the life of Dr. Mudd, for example, but was very loath to entertain questions. Travelers need to be warned that the Fort has no railing on the second or third floors so young children must be carefully monitored to make sure they don't fall off the fort which is easy to do. Finally, if one does seek to snorkel, be sure to around the fort to the right of the port-sally to the back side and then head out in the water with the beach to your right to find coral and fish. Otherwise you may see nothing more than sand. Be aware that the snorkeling is not monitored and the surf can be strong. Be mindful of your own personal swimming capabilities and I suggest you not let kids go into the deeper water without being accompanied by an adult.","February 15, 2013",Worth the Long Journey Out and Back,56,"Keswick, Virginia",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We camped out for one night. WOW! What an amazing experience! The Fort itself is just amazing to tour and you can just wonder around. The boat arrives about 10 am and if you are only doing the day trip it will leave about 2:30 or 3:00. When the boat leaves, the island becomes even more amazing! There were only 8 campers, including my party or 2. My friend and I climbed to the third level of the Fort and watched the sunset. We would not see another human being in sight! They do a few staff members that stay in the Fort overnight - so you are not without any help if you have an emergency. The camping is not as difficult as the park's website would lead you to believe. You have to bring your food, water, and supplies, but you have access to food, water, and bathrooms on the boat up until the boat leaves around 3 pm, but then the boat is back at 10:30 am and you have access to everything again. Unless we walked by the tents of the other campers, we never saw them. It was an amazing experience. When the boat leaves and it is just the campers, you have to Fort to yourself. We had unrestricted access for the most part. I cannot say enough great words about this experience! We are planning to turn in a couple of months and camp out for the maximum 3 nights. Whether you are going out for the day trip or to camp, it is well worth the money.","February 14, 2013",Expensive Trip - BUT- Amazing Experience!,61,"Miami, Florida",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"Let me just say that we did the overnight camping trip the morning after our wedding! It doesn't sound like the romantic and pampering way to go but we just couldn't pass up the opportunity to see the amazing sunset, stars, and the sunrise that many reviews and websites encouraged and for extra few dollars, it seemed like a bonus to experience a remote island getaway.And they were right! To us, it was well worth the time, money, and hassle (we had to ship camping gear at over 50lbs from Chicago to Key West, rented wet suits since it was February, and cut short our wedding night celebration for early rising to name a few) but this island will always be part of our honeymoon memory!Sunset and sunrise was spectacular and we have never seen so many stars! Felt like we could touch them and there were billions... We're not campers by any standard, but we easily survived (they have amazingly clean bathrooms, sans flushing but with lights) and truly enjoyed being there even if it was a little breezy and visibility in the water was not as clear as we hoped it would be the first day. It cleared up on our second day and got to do some very nice snorkeling, finding reef pods and saw huge barracudas. Learning about the history of the fort was also fascinating and the trip was relaxing. It's nice to see this place being so taken care of even with daily visitors via ferry and air/sea charters.If you're thinking of camping, do it! Even if you never camped, we did it and was better than I thought it would be (just go to a local grocery store and buy gallons of water and some lunch meat, bread, etc or granola bars, we didn't try to cook...) there were no bugs and although they say rats exist, we didn't hear or see any lurking around (which was my fear). The park has rangers staying in the fort so we felt safe and they even had some hard case coolers you can use while you're there, which worked great for us. I think we would have really missed out if we didn't camp - so I'll recommend camping there for anyone who wants to experience the remote island at night!","February 13, 2013","Worth the time, money, and camping hassles!",70,"Chicago, Illinois",5

If you don't snorkel, it can get a little boring - but it is beautiful to just walk around or just sit and enjoy. The breakfast and lunch were nice - nothing fancy but good.

Ham, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, bagels, etc. Mostly carbs & protein. If you want an OJ for later, get it now since the food gets put away once breakfast is over and you'll have to pay for extras later. Lunch was much better, with chicken salad, cold cuts, chips, potato salad, PBJ and cookies offered. Again, if you want an extra soda or water for later, grab it before lunch hours are over. Otherwise you'll pay for anything extra.Four hours at Fort Jefferson doesn't seem like a lot, but there's plenty of time to tour the fort, snorkel and have lunch. We were more than ready to leave when our time was up.The fort was interesting, they offer a free guided tour that is recommended. After the tour you're free to roam around on your own.Snorkeling wasn't very good while we were there, it was a bit windy so the clarity wasn't 100%. We still had fun, though.The water is absolutely gorgeous at the Dry Tortugas, we took a lot of pictures with that clear turquoise water behind us.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"It was rough getting there - waves were choppy, and our tour boat broke down not once, but twice. So we were stranded on the open ocean, with waves rolling the boat up and down. BUT, it was totally worth it. This place is paradise. The water is was great- we snorkeled around it. The fort was interesting. I'd love to camp here overnight to see the stars. ","January 27, 2013",Go! Just go!!!,24,"Lakeland, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Since there is very little info. out there on camping at the Park I am writing a somewhat longer post in the hope of answering most of the questions we had before we went; just got back from three days of tent camping. This is an extraordinary and unique camping experience that we highly recommend. It requires a little more advance planning, and quite a bit more expense than a normal camping trip but it’s well worth the time and money. You can only get to the island by the official ferry (Yankee Freedom III), a seaplane, or a private boat. For campers without their own boats the only option is the ferry. This is an excellent service; see related posts on this board for more info. on the ferry.Gear Weight Limit of 60 Pounds (not including water) – The ferry advertises a weight limit but, unlike the airlines, they did not weigh our equipment and nit-pick us on excess weight. I got the impression that as long as you bring a reasonable amount of gear, and do not try to take advantage of the situation, they are not going to hard time you on weight.All Gear Must Be In Containers – For the trip out to the island the camping gear is, literally, stored on the back of the boat so it all needs to be in containers or it will get wet, or fall overboard. Large plastic bins worked well for us.Water – you have to bring your own since it is not available on the island (hence the name ""DRY"" Tortugas). The recommendations range from 1 gallon per person per day, to 2 gallons per person per day. We brought 2.5 gallons per person per day and had way too much water. These recommendations are really talking about total liquid consumed per person every day, not just water, so if you are bringing other drinks (coke, coffee, Gatorade, etc.) you don’t really need 2 gallons of water on top of that. Campsites – There are really only about 6-8 true campsites and only about 4 are located in the shade. You pretty much have to take what you can get when you arrive. The sites in the shade are the best. The overflow area is completely open to the sun which is not pleasant on most days.Facilities – there are bathrooms on the island with toilets, but no running water, sinks, showers or sinks. These are only open when the ferry is not at the dock. When the ferry is there the restrooms on the boat are open to campers. Campers can go on the ferry anytime to get a drink of water, buy soft drinks, snacks, or just cool off.Cooking – The only fuels you are allowed to use are charcoal or Sterno. Each campsite has a grill so charcoal works just fine but you are not supposed to bring lighter fluid so the self-starting version is needed.Trash – You have to haul all of your trash back to Key West on the ferry; there are no trash cans on the island to speak of. It pays to bring paper (as opposed to plastic) plates, cups etc. because they can all be burned in the charcoal grills and not hauled back. Large garbage bags are a must.Animals – There seems to be a lot of lore about rats infesting the island but we only saw one or two at night scurrying around in the bushes. They seemed to be afraid of people did not come anywhere near our campsite or bother us in any way. Honestly, the rats were a complete non-factor. There are a lot of Hermit Crabs on this island and the kids enjoyed collecting them and having Hermit Crab races.Not Alone – The island is not as devoid of people as some of the reviews suggest. If you want total solitude you might try Alaska or someplace like that. From roughly 10am to 2:45pm the ferry is at the dock and all the people that came over (up to 150) are exploring the fort and island, snorkeling, and laying on the beach. In addition, there is a Seaplane that comes out several times as day dropping off and picking up about 8 people at a time. There are also a few people that come to the island on their own boats and some of them camp. One or two Rangers live inside the fort so they are there is you have a problem. And while we were there a group of Air Force Reservists was on the island doing some rehab construction work on the fort. Weather – Even in January it was fairly hot during the day but it cooled off nicely at night. Even so, a normal sleeping bag was too heavy. A light blanket or lightweight sleeping bag is all you really need. The weather effects the snorkeling conditions quite a bit; if it’s too windy or rough, or cloudy, the water is not as clear and you can’t see as much. In January the water is cooler so you can get cold if you stay in too long. An “insider” told us that the end of October and beginning on November were the best times to go because it is starting to cool off, but the water is still warm, and the winds and seas are not too rough. Internet/Cell Phones – There is no wi-fi or cell phone service on the island.BOTTOM LINE: One of the most unique and best camping experiences we have ever had. It is worth the long drive to Key West and the 2.5 hour boat trip to the island. We will definitely be going back.","January 26, 2013",Camping FAQ -- Just Do It,95,Tampa Florida,5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the float plane option to get to Dry Tortugas National Park and I'm so glad we did. The fort is amazing, but the flight in really helps you appreciate the whole site. The fort was never finished and the floor is a bit rough in places but you can wander around 3/4 of it (the rest is offices for the National Park service) including the upper levels. The best views are from the top level. Our pilot gave us a brief tour and then left us to explore on our own.Despite being in the middle of the sea there is some vegetation inside the fort and as a result there were insects, I hadn't used any insect repellent and did get bitten.The site has toilets but these are closed while the ferry is docked and the ferry toilets are used (for environmental reasons) instead. There is a small gift shop but you should take all food and drink as there is nowhere the buy this on the island and you are asked to take all rubbish back with you.Several of the people on our flight went snorkeling but if you don't want to do this you can walk around the outside of the fort (there is a wall) and you can look down into the water and see the fish.Well worth a trip and the float plane was great.","January 26, 2013",Amazing flight in and great views of the fort,387,UK,5

Breakfast and lunch were included in the cost. They told us the best months are April or May when the waters are calmer. Snorkeling would be great but the waves were rough.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The tour books mention that many folks want to go to the national park for the Fort but few in fact go. We booked the Yankee Freedom boat tour through our concierge - an 7:15 am start to a wonderful day -- the two plus hour boat ride was smooth and once at the park we followed one of the guides one a history of the fort ""in the middle of nowhere"" -- fascinating and unique experience. After a buffet style lunch at a picnic table, my wife and I went snorkeling around the south beach area before returning to Key West at 5:30 arriving to a water view of the beginning of the Mallory Square sunset ceremonies.The one criticism is the on board food + bar service-- a buffet breakfast of ham + boiled eggs, bread/bagels and then lunch essentially the same food over again. Apparently the tour company used to offer an ""open bar"" on the return trip and now is a cash bar. Don't let that discourage you -- well worth a day and you won't find many national parks ""in the middle of nowhere"" with such a history","January 20, 2013",Well worth the day + the dollars,43,"Brights Grove, Canada",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"This is a whole day trip. We took the boat tour out of Key West with Yankee Freedom II, a brand-new high speed ferry. You spend 2 1/2 hours each way on the boat but it is quite comfortable and breakfast and lunch are included. You get to spend 4 1/4 hours on the Island. It has a big civil war era fort, now a near ruin, with a tour of the fort included, and there are two small beaches with good snorkeling around. The beaches are white sandy bottom and the water a gorgeous turquoise so very pleasant for shallow water swimming and snorkeling. Good quality snorkel equipment is also provided to everyone included in the tour fee. You see coral and colorful fish. They sell cocktails on the boat on the way back. A pleasant day. The only annoying thing was the unexpected $4 ""fuel surcharge"" that we were forced to pay when we showed up at the boat AFTER buying the supposedly all-inclusive tickets and then the incessant begging for tips for the staff.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Our whole reason for going to Key West was to take the boat to the Dry Tortugas for a day trip of snorkeling and fun. The day before the scheduled trip, I called just to check on whether lunch was supplied or whether we should take some food. I was told at that point (at about noon) that the boat was cancelled due to mechanical difficulties. I was offered a chance to book for two days later, but we couldn't stay so I took the refund. The person I spoke to said he was going to start making calls, but I have no reason to believe that. I asked about other trips and there was a more expensive seaplane option. I looked into it, but it's practically a flyover and costs more than the boat (which already is expensive for a day trip). Those are the only options for a day in the Dry Tortugas. I have no idea how frequently these service problems occur, but it really was a pain in the neck. We did get our refund, but it might have been nice if the company had maybe sent us even an apology (a discount coupon in case we decided to chance it again would have been nicer and maybe the only thing that would persuade us to try again).","January 6, 2013",They Cancelled the Boat,55,"New York City, New York",1

The ferry costed $160+ and it made me throw out almost everything in me. The meals on the ferry were as simple as you could imagine plus when we got there for lunch no fruit was left so I only had a few cookies. The island was small and literally empty. You can go snorkeling but probably will not see much. The island was pretty if it did not cost so much to get there. I would rather go for some water sports in key west if I have a choice. However, if you want to visit all the national parks, it is one. BTW, we probably was not there during the right season.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"I am giving this only average rating for a couple of reasons: it is not a cheap trip by any means, and they nickel and dime you once aboard. Water, $1, dramamine, $1, on and on. Also, 4 hours on the island just got to be too much for most of us. That being said, the boat ride is 2.5 hours of joy on the water, even tho it was chilly. There was loads of room, inside and out. Facilities were clean, and the staff was super friendly. Our tour guide of Fort Jefferson was knowledgable and funny, the fort is quite something to see. Our daughters snorkeled while we did the tour, and they saw all kinds of fish and coral. Breakfast and lunch on the boat was very pedestrian, and my vegetarian daughter had little to choose from, cheese and bread. I would not do it again, and I would caution others.

We opted for the boat and did not regret it. The water views were fantastic. While the trip is long, it was a lovely day for the trip. Several people did get seasick so if this can be a problem, take some Dramamine beforehand. We took the guided tour of the fort which was very interesting and historical. The gift shop is small and didn't offer much. Some people were camping, but that is a bit too primitive for us. The water is amazing and the snorkeling is like nowhere else I have been, absolutely worth the trip. The entire place doesn't seem to have changed much in the last 100 years. They are working on restoration, but that can be a difficult thing with the elements constantly working against them.

You can take a day trip out by plane or ferry, or do what we did and camp out there. The fort is 70 miles from Key West in the middle of the Gulf. It's got quite a bit of history. It's a great place to go snorkeling, kayaking, scuba diving, fishing, or just beach going. I would highly recommend camping there. There's 8 camp sites so when all the ""day trippers"" leave, it's like having an island to yourself. The camp sites are not as primitive as we thought. Each site had a grill, picnic table, and place to hang items off the ground. There is no running water for campers, but the ferry comes in every day if you want ice, take a cold fresh water shower, or even grab a bite to eat.","December 30, 2012",Absolutely Must Visit!,77,"Orlando, Florida",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you like to visit remote places, if you like historical sites, if you like tropical fish or snorkeling, the ferry trip to the Dry Tortugas is for you. This is a full day experience and at approx $160 pp, it ain't cheap, but it was the highlight of our Key West visit and I have wanted to visit for years!! This trip did not disappoint.During our last visit, the ferry was sold out for the entire week, so I would urge you to explore the website (yankeefreedom.com) before you leave home. Pick a day with warm, calm weather so that the sea is not churned up. The Yankee Freedom III is a beautiful new ship only a few months old. We checked in at 7:15 am at the Key West Bight (parking garage nearby for $13 per day) and boarded the vessel at about 7:45 am. Continental Breakfast was waiting (ham, bagels, hard boiled eggs, cereal, coffee, juice, milk, etc) and if you need dramamine, it is sold onboard. The trip takes about 3 hours. Bring a deck of cards. You can wander about outside and maybe even see sea turtles swimming by. The people watching is also fairly entertaining. We got some laughs making fun of some creepy old guys openly ogling and even photographing attractive young ladies who were traveling alone. That was until we realized that one creepy old guy was sitting with his wife and adult kids directly behind us and his family heard every word. Oops. Upon arrival at the fort, you will disembark, leaving your possessions on the picnic tables and go on a guided tour of the fort immediately. There are no bathrooms on the island, so use the facilities on the ship!!!. The tour is very informative and the photo opps are awesome. If you are a photographer, you will love it!!! I also recommend spending a little time looking at the exhibits in the fort office and exploring the fort on your own. Next up is lunch on the ship, then don your swimsuit in the changing facilities at the dock. The ship's crew provides a snorkeling map and snorkeling gear. The water is fairly calm and a beautiful shade of turquoise. No collecting shells or sea glass as it is strictly forbidden. Or you can stay dry and just walk around the moat because you can see many beautiful fish from the moat wall. Shower off on the ship and then change back into your clothes in the changing facility. If you have time, walk out on the beach peninsula next to the fort,the ship departs around 2:45pm. Adult frozen beverages and snacks are available for an extra charge. You will be asked to rate the ship, crew and overall experience. The crew (with their tip jar) will be waiting to say goodbye as you disembark around 5:30 pm at Key West Bight, tired and happy at having spent the day on a remote tropical island!!!

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Having visited Yellowstone, Zion, Grand Canyon, and Yosemite parks to name just a few, we can honestly say this is close to the top of our favorite national parks. We took the seaplane to get the Dry Tortugas which we highly recommend. You can read about that experience under Key West Seaplane Adventures. What made the Dry Tortugas national park so interesting to us was first the remoteness. Besides the Alaskan parks and Isle Royal it is one of the most remote parks. The quiet surroundings and beautiful blue water are so relaxing. (We went on a day when the ferry wasn't running so there were only about 15 people on the island. Every day may not be so quiet.) Also, the Fort and its history are amazing. We spent a lot more time wandering around the fort than we thought we would.Bottom-line, if you are on the fence about going, we would definitely recommend it. If you are hesitant to go out on the long boat ride take the seaplane. Also, we didn't have the time but if you are into camping, this would be a truly unique camping experience. Just make sure you bring everything you need as there are no facilities on the island including water. We actually would like to make more time and go back and camp as we can only imagine how beautiful it must be at night.Lastly as others have said, take water and sunscreen.

Dry Tortugas National Park,"The flight was excellent, it was quite an experience to fly in a seaplane. The landing was really very smooth although the subsequent take-off was a little bumpy but this simply added to the excitement for me. For most of the flight the pilot was able to fly at very low altitude, about 150 metres above the sea. This afforded a wonderful view of some nurse sharks and turtles en route. The island and fort were very interesting and relaxing, mainly because we arrived before the hoard of tourists who had chosen the slower and less expensive boat trip.However, I'd describe the snorkelling as disappointing at best. Visibility was about 3-5 metres and the sea was slightly murky. There was very little live coral around the island, but there seemed to be a great deal of dead coral on the sand, maybe this had washed to shallow waters from the deeper ocean as I couldn't really identify any areas of coral that had recently died and remained attached to any structures.I did see a lone barracuda, several dead fish ( I think pipefish) floating on the surface and a large number of yellow grunts. I also saw a medium size grouper, grey angel fish and a lot of small fish (about 5-7cm) that I do not recognise, bright blue dorsum with a bright yellow underbelly. Having said all of this, we snorkelled in only one of the areas recommended by the guide, just off the southern tip of the fort perimeter. There is a reef about 150 metres offshore that is supposed to have better snorkelling and if you're able to swim that distance it may well be worth it. We did a half day trip and that gave us about 2h45m on the island, we found this ample time. The is a small concession shop within the fort where one can buy postcards and memorabilia. This is located alongside the information office. The company we flew with provide excellent information on the islands, snorkelling equipment and coolers and drinks for the trip. If you can afford the more expensive seaplane transport rather than the slower and cheaper boat alternative it's well worth it.","December 18, 2012",Exciting trip to a an interesting venue,51,"Billericay, United Kingdom",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I took the ferry over to the Dry Tortugas. It was a long trip over and a long trip back. The ferry was accomodating and the staff very professional. I would not recommend this trip to anyone who suffers from sea sickness or is sensitive to the sun. Take lots of sunscreen and take lots of water. You will need both.Be sure to take a good camera. Lots of good photo opportunites will be available to you.Take time to do the walking tour of the fort. It has a lot of historical value.The snorkeling was not as great as you are led to believe. I actually saw more fish just walking along the moat wall that surrounds the island fort. Lots of bird varieties for watching, though.Restrooms were only available on the boat and the line can be long at times.The park staff was very friendly and helpful.If you are only going to be in Key West a few days, take the seaplane over and spend more time in Old Town.","December 16, 2012",Beautiful Place But a Long Day,36,"Duncan, South Carolina",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"I was not prepared for the beauty of this place. I had only planned to spend an afternoon but the guy from the kayak rental place talked me into camping for 2 nights -it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. We were there in December and were told that the weather had been bad for 2 months but somehow we got a great window - it was nice enough for us to paddle the 3 miles (each way) trip over to Loggerhead Key where we snorkeled in an area called ""little Africa"" - this was amazing and were the only people on Loggerhead for the first 1/2 of the day until another couple arrived. The fort is amazing, the history incredible, and the rangers are super friendly (understandable as they have such an amazing environment to work in) - Do this trip if you have the means to do it - you won't regret","December 10, 2012",a MUST DO trip - camp overnight if you can,126,"Hull, Massachusetts",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,I took the trip out to Dry Tortugas over the Thanksgiving holiday. On the day I went there were high seas and the trip out was rocky. Once at the Dry Tortugas I went snorkeling and walked around the fort. It is truly amazing to be able to see and swim this old fort. While walking around I was amazed that they were able to build such a large fort in such a remote location. The park was great and it was a unique trip.,"December 9, 2012",Well Worth The Trip.,29,"Fairfax, Virginia",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"If you enjoy history, architecture, or the beautiful caribbean vistas, then this trip will be a tripple-crown for you. It's an all-day adventure. The ferry boat takes about two hours each way, but it's worth the trip, which is about $100 per person. If you're in a hurry, you can hire a seaplane for about $250 a person, and it only takes about 20 minutes. This is a Civil War era fort with no fresh water source. So the design had to incorporate means of collecting and storing enough rainwater to last through the dry seasons for 1,500 troops. Stunning views from atop the fort. If you're going to spend a few bucks on some activity, make this a top priority. Other adventure will give you a thrill, but you'll never forget your visit to this fort. Perfect for kids.","December 7, 2012",Best Day Trip in all of South Florida,7,"Concord, New Hampshire",5

Dry Tortugas National Park,"Whenever we are in Key West, we try to get out to this national park. It is accessible by seaplane, ferry, or private boat. During our most recent visits we've used the park's high speed ferry service. Be sure to enjoy the views of ocean surroundings during the trip out and back as it is part of the whole experience. From the deck we viewed various wildlife, including boobies and frigate birds, dolphins, etc. The guide explains the history of Ft. Jefferson and the ecology of the Dry Tortugas while you're on the island and a lunch is served after, down by the shore. We used the snorkeling gear included in the trip price and explored along the fort wall. My floatation vest had a leak but it was no trouble to exchange it for one that worked. (P.S. Spelling on Tripadvisor for this attraction should be ""Tortugas"", spanish for turtles.)","October 9, 2012",A remote but must see experience,30,"Tucson, Arizona",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"As a Floridian, I have always wanted to visit Dry Tortugas. Took the boat with family (daughters 12 and 15). Friendly crew. Water was amazing. We saw flying fish and dolphins along the way. Clear water with great colors surround the island. Did not see a lot of fish while snorkeling. Tour of fort was very interesting","September 15, 2012",Bucket list,24,"Stuart, Florida",4
Dry Tortugas National Park,"This place is AWESOME!!! My girlfriend and I went for the day on the Yankee Freedom. It's a little expensive but mostly worth it. Long boat ride but very serene on the water. Its about a 2.5 hr ride. They have breakfast on the boat on the way out. Did not participate because I had breakfast before we got there. When you arrive you can either go on a guided tour or make your own tour. We walked around ourselves and it was still interesting. Great pictures from the top of the fort. Only wish you could actually go into the lighthouse. Maybe it was just closed when we went. Also they show this other island that is somewhat attached, you also can not go onto that island. Looked fun to hang out on but maybe was closed that day also because of the storm that just passed. After the tour or before you can go snorkeling. My girlfriend and I tried the snorkeling on a different all day adventure last year and did not like it at all. But we figured we would try it again this year. Very glad we did. It was amazing seeing all the sealife around the fort. Got some good pictures and held a living conch. Would probably do it agian if it wasn't for the long boat ride. You could also go camping out there overnight or for 3 days. Which to me seems very creepy. But overall it was a great trip. Definately recommend!!!","September 2, 2012",GREAT!!!!,17,"Bayonne, New Jersey",5
Dry Tortugas National Park,"We took the seaplane service out there and that would have been wonderful just in itself. The Fort and tour will be fascinating to Civil War history buffs; really, to anyone interesting in 19th Century Navy history. The reef is in much better condition than many close to the populated areas of The Keys. Whether you go for a half-day or full day, it will be unforgettable.","August 27, 2012",Some of the best reef snorkeling in the Keys plus history,15,"Sugarloaf Key, Florida",5
