Rock Harbor,"My wife and I spent five days on the island and we spent most of our time around rock Harbor. It had two reasonable restaurants, a nice campground, interesting hikes and a lot of very nice people.They also have a resident bull moose, Bruce the moose, who we ran into in one of the campgrounds. We got some great photos of him.","September 12, 2019",Great base for the island,423,"Wellfleet, Massachusetts",5

Rock Harbor,I highly recommend a visit. This is a very rustic peaceful and off the grid place. We spent only one day. I suggest at least 3-4 days. We were lucky enough to see a magnificent moose. ,"August 19, 2019",Loved the Island,6,,5
Rock Harbor,"Rock Harbor is the jump off point for a true nature adventure. Isle Royal is a fantastic natural beauty. From here, you can begin your hike, water taxi to more remote areas if the island, or simply stay at the lodge and book an excursion on the Sandy, rent a kayak, or read out on the deck. This is Michigan’s only national park, and although not often visited, it is a not to miss adventure. If you are bucket listing national parks, don’t overlook this one. Moose, bald eagles, and abundant trails await.","August 9, 2019",Your adventure to a fantastic experience begins here,7,"Shelby Township, Michigan",5
Rock Harbor,"My wife and I just returned from a 3 day, 2 night stay on Isle Royale and it was easily one of the top vacations we have ever had. Getting there is no joke - we took the ferry from Copper Harbor and it was about 3.5 hours on the way to Isle Royale and close to 4 hours on the way back. I would definitely recommend dramamine or the behind-the-ear motion sickness patches if you tend toward queasiness. We were very impressed with how smoothly operated the ferry logistics ended up being, and Rock Harbor is absolutely beautiful. The staff we interacted with at Rock Harbor were all very pleasant. Gift shop / trading post is well stocked with items you may have forgotten / need on the island. We aren't backpackers or campers, so lodging was necessary - we stayed in a housekeeping cabin and while expensive, was definitely worth it. We would absolutely love to return - what a gem this place is!","June 18, 2019",Unforgettable Trip!,12,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Rock Harbor,Rock Harbor lodge is set on a serene and beautiful part of Lake Superior. I suggest the lodge lakeside rooms (lower floor has deck right by lake). Staff provide excellent customer service. Rooms are modest but adequate. This is a remote island and lodges old. We did have a few issues with heat and hot water being out briefly but staff were diligent in fixing ASAP.,"June 14, 2019",Great service! Unbelievable view,11,"Rochester, Minnesota",4
Rock Harbor,"We are in the process of planning our 4th trip to Isle Royale National Park, so that should tell you how much we love this place. Rock Harbor is the central hub of the island. We have stayed at the lodge and in a house keeping cabin. I think all lodge rooms have a view of Lake Superior. The rooms aren't fancy and they aren't cheap, but they provide everything one needs. If you are coming to Rock Harbor, you are probably there to enjoy the scenery anyway, so who needs a fancy hotel room? Housekeeping Cabins are nice as well as they include a small kitchenette and a little more floor space to spread out.Activities include miles of trails to backpack or day hike, boat tours on the Sandy, canoe rentals, and fishing excursions. If you enjoy outdoor activities, Rock Harbor is a great place to visit.","May 22, 2019","If you enjoy national parks, this is one you won't want to miss.",8,"Newburgh, Indiana",5
Rock Harbor,"Rock Harbor is quite long. The water near the docking area is actually called Snug Harbor and it is here where you will find the NPS information center, a souvenir/convenience store, canoes and kayaks to rent and paths leading to huts for backpackers, trails for everyone, path to the plane dock and beginning of a couple trails. Rock Harbor has a lodge and two restaurants. It might take you a day to get your bearings, but once that happens, you will find all you need in this fairly compressed area.","September 18, 2018","Some civiliation, some ruggedness",131,"Niles, Michigan",5
Rock Harbor,"A number of choices for 2, 4 and more mile hikes. Also canoes and kayaks are available. The Grill was reasonably priced, somewhat better than the restaurant, with good service.

Rock Harbor,"My review is about the Rock Harbor area as a whole, I have separate reviews of the lodge and the two restaurants. If you are not backpacking, this is the place you want to be, or if you just need more civilization during your trip. It can be anything from a near resort experience to a base camp for daily hiking and excursions, which is what we used it for. There are enough trails originating here to keep you busy for several days if you are an avid hiker, and if you utilize the water taxi, rent a canoe or kayak, or take advantage of the tours offered by the lodge you can expand the amount of activities from the Rock Harbor base by a factor of three, easily. For some reason the lodge did not mention the excursions they offer when we checked in - ranger led hikes or visits to naturalists in other areas of the island, and we had to ask. There's definitely some issues with the office staff and lodge housekeeping staff, but everything else is wonderful. They offer evening informational programs and even had a band performing on one of the docks one night. We were there three nights and really enjoyed our Rock Harbor experience.","August 24, 2018","If you are not backpacking, this is the place to be.",320,"Maple Grove, Minnesota",4
Rock Harbor,"Not a family friendly place I must say. The GM of the Lodge lacks tact and customer service focus. Don't skip rocks in ""his private harbor."" The GM, Kim Alexander, will fly out from his closed door office to claim it is his private dock and tell you with stern attitude that there are 1000s of feet of shoreline to skip rocks. There are no signs anywhere that distinguishes areas that are ""private"" and that which is national park- it is all the same from appearances. Nothing, no signs explain a boundary of private owned property and NP property. Kim’s claims of private property boundaries are a bit confusing. From The standpoint of a 10 year old boy who sees rocks and a huge area of water, skipping rocks is the thing to do. After the first gruff warning, we moved over thinking we were off of Mr. Alexander’s private location. We thought we had moved over enough in the harbor, yet he flew from his office a second time to gruffly stake claim to it all. The NP conducts Ranger led tours that leave from Kim’s “private” section of the park. Unsure how the NPS tolerates that kind of behavior. I was on the island 3 days and saw the GM twice, once when he flew out of his office- I happened to be at the desk to witness his angry exit outside to reprimand my son for skipping rocks in the only harbor that includes the NP office and the Lodge. Another when he walked thru the dining area without a smile or desire to make eye contact with patrons. His mission to speak to a staff member, speaking to no guests. As a GM shouldn't you be checking on guests with a smile as you are walking about? Perhaps my expectations were too high... to be the only lodge on the least visited NP island, wouldn't you do all you can to make your guests want to return? I suppose when you are the only one that the NPS looks to to provide lodging at Isle Royale, you can throw your weight around. Just did not sit well with me. Lodging was nothing special and served its purpose. It was clear that these rooms are closed most of the year with no real effort made when reopening for the Summer season. Thinking next time we will consider tent camping and bypass this Lodge. ","July 27, 2018",Lodging Disappointing ,5,,2
Rock Harbor,"We took the Isle Royale Queen IV over from Copper Harbor and had a smooth ride both ways. On the way there, the waves were projected as being 0-2 feet tall, and on the way back, they predicted 2-4 foot tall waves. The boat was noticeably rockier on the way back, but no one was seasick either time. Rock Harbor is a small area of the island that offers electricity and running water. There is a ranger information center and a store that sells food and supplies that aren't as outrageously priced as we'd feared. There are docks where people can pay to dock their boats overnight. There are two restrooms in the area and two connecting restaurants in addition to a screened-in camp area, cabins, and the lodge. There are a number of trails that leave from the area that are absolutely beautiful. Some are lined with wild flowers, others go over bog. Some go through pine and aspen forest and emerge on rocky shores. It's breathtaking.The park service employees were amazing, kind, and helpful. We had nothing but positive experiences everywhere but in our room. While the room has beautiful views and offers a hot shower and electricity, it's not well maintained. The rooms stink heavily of moth balls. There are no fitted sheets on the bed. The comforter was stained with boot prints. There was mildew and mold in the bathroom, and it was difficult to get the tub faucet to stop dripping. The radiator was difficult to keep switched off, and parts of it along the baseboard fell off and were held on by old duct tape. Paint was chipping on the doors (lead-based, I think). There was no bathroom vent, and the window had a screen on the inside so you couldn't open the window for ventilation. That said, the lodge is the only place to stay on the island with hot water and electricity in the rooms, so we'd stay there again. However, I do think it's appalling that they charge about $300 for rooms that are so filthy and poorly maintained. I get it's a remote location, but this is the type of place you would walk out of if it was located anywhere else.","July 22, 2018",Excellent Destination - Lodge Not So Much,104,"Des Moines, Iowa",4

Rock Harbor,My sister and I took the boat from Houghton to Rock Harbor on Isle Royale and really enjoyed both the ride and the visit. The ride over was a little rough due to weather but that just made it more fun and exciting. The ride back was smooth. This is a beautiful place. Rooms at the Lodge are basic but clean and comfortable; no TV. But who needs a TV with the beautiful scenery and the lake right outside our door/windows. Good food at the restaurant and everyone was very helpful - brought our bags to and from our room to the boat.

Rock Harbor,"Since Trip Advisor does not have a way to review Isle Royale National Park as a whole, I'm using the Rock Harbor review to talk about our recent visit. I backpacked Isle Royale in 1990. Returned this year with my wife, who had not been. We stayed at the Lodge, which in 1990 was priced in a reasonable way (not today). The reception off the ferry was not the same. In 1990 we were met by the typical National Park ranger, who gave us a sense we were important visitors coming to an important place. She was highly enthusiastic, with a good sense of humor, talked about the opportunities, helped us think about itineraries, and hit important points about low impact.This time the ranger seemed like a transfer from law enforcement. No humor, and little sense that we were important visitors. More of a sense of ""you're probably going to ruin this island unless I lay down some rules for you in a no-nonsense fashion. We tolerate your presence here.""This stood out, because over forty years we've found that rangers tend to enhance our experience at national and state parks. Not this time.Though I should mention Lori, who led the harbor walk one day. Definitely a fun experience, very informative. And the guy at the boat dock, who patiently talked with us as we kept checking to see if the weather report had changed enough to let us take a canoe.Because of a delay in ferry schedule, lodge visitors were told after our orientation that we should go check into our rooms, that the visitor's center would not be open to us. When we came back a half hour later, maybe 5:15, it was closed for the day. When we came back at 8 a.m., it was closed. So people who arrived on the ferry at 4:00 p.m. (from Copper Harbor, delayed), and stayed at the lodge, had no ranger to ask questions about hikes for about the first 18 hours. No trail maps were available anywhere else. We managed, but more in spite of the NPS. In contrast, not only do I remember the rangers from 1990 at Isle Royale, we also vividly remember the rangers at Cape Cod National Seashore last summer, who gave us some specific tips on whale and seal watching that made a big difference. And steered us to the specific beaches we would like. That's the typical experience.As I said, I remember the lodge being affordable before, so as I left Isle Royale in 1990 I thought I'd come back decades later as a lodge visitor (backpacking is not a physical option for us now). The price of the lodge was a bit above a state park cabin or lodge then. Today it is about 2.5 times more costly than a state park cabin or lodge. Isle Royale has essentially said -- ""If you're not able to backpack and your job is not well above the median salary, we're not really for you."" Other than the good views, the lodge is in no way like a $240 room elsewhere, but more like a mediocre $80 room. Which would be all right at $95, or even $115.Did we have a good time? Yes. See a lot of nature? Yes. Do we recommend it to others? Yes. But money has to enter into the equation for 2/3 of the population. Would I recommend a very expensive trip to Isle Royale for my friends, or a shorter much more affordable one to the Porcupine Mountain area? (Less than half the cost for better lodging, with a Lake Superior view too, and overall an experience that is maybe 1/3 the cost of the Isle Royale visit. Without the 3.5 hours of rolling Lake Superior boat ride.) That conversation has changed. I'm much more likely to talk about the Porcupine Mountains, Indiana Dunes, Cape Cod Seashore, the Everglades, Mammoth Cave, etc. Those experiences seem more welcoming and way more affordable. And those are also remarkable experiences in nature.Maybe it's the people now in charge in Washington, the worst in modern history. But the National Park Service has always seemed to be able to rise above leadership problems in Washington.","September 12, 2017",Not blown away by the National Park Service on this visit.,71,midwest,3
Rock Harbor,"As the main harbor on Isle Royale, there is a lodge available, restaurants, National Park Rangers, a small store with limited food and toiletry items as well as camping/hiking supplies. There is a small marina at which you can rent kayaks, canoes, or skiffs, or dock & gas up a private boat. Boat tours on The Sandy depart from Rock Harbor, too. The sunset cruise was definitely worthwhile! ","August 17, 2017",So serene,11,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",5

Rock Harbor,"My friend and I took the ferry from Copper Harbor into Isle Royale NP. The 3 hour ride over is a long sometimes rocky ride. Once parked, our luggage was taken to our room and we set out to check in. They had someone standing outside directing us in one reservation at a time at the guest office. Once we checked in, we headed over to the restaurant. Our package included all meals and we were very happy with the meals- fresh white fish and trout and fish tacos were our favorites and wild blueberry cobbler with ice cream! The hikes were not easy- rocky and rooty paths, rock mountains, and muddy places. We went to Scoville, Suzy's Cave, Lookout Louise (with canoe trip over to Hidden Lake) and Mt Franklin. The only complaint would be about the boat rental- one person took care of the rentals and the fishing boats coming in- gas, etc. we waited an hour for him while 3 people stood in the Ranger Station standing around. He was apologetic but I felt bad for the guy. Service was top notch other than that and I would recommend for anyone who loves to hike and nature. No moose sightings sadly but great views of Lake Superior and so many beautiful flowers along the trails. Bring bug spray and hair nets! The store does not carry Epsom Salt.","July 23, 2017",Missed the animals,53,"Allegan, Michigan",4
Rock Harbor,"You can't stay at the Rock Harbor campground or the Three Mile campground for more than one consecutive night each. I was expecting to just set up camp and do day-hikes, but because of their limits, I needed to hike all the way to Daisy Farm to stay multiple nights. This was my first experience doing overnight, back-country hiking, and my pack was too heavy. When you get to Rock Harbor there is a chart with suggested pack weight limits based on the hiker's weight. Wish I'd seen that BEFORE I got to the island. So my first two days were extremely difficult and by the time I got to Daisy Farm I was sick. From there, though, I arranged a water taxi ride back so I could enjoy the next two nights right there and do the day hikes as originally intended. I got to see a bull moose, loons, friendly snakes, other wildlife and endless flowers. Would definitely go again, but would be better prepared. Not a beginner's hike! Bring trekking poles. It was strenuous, rocky, muddy, overgrown - at times I lost the trail completely. The outstanding feature of Isle Royale is its wilderness, and it is fabulous wilderness. True back country. Loved it, wish I could live there.","July 10, 2017",Important information not on their website,4,"Detroit, Michigan",5
Rock Harbor,"I'm a National Parks lover, so felt at home in the basic lodge room. When we got to our room, the window was open a little bit and you could hear the water lapping against the rocks outside. If I hadn't wanted to get out and hike, I would have sat there all day. We thought it wouldn't be very crowded because it was fairly early in the season and our ferry over was far from full. But a tour group was there and the two restaurants were always crowded when we were there. The nicer restaurant seemed to handle the crowds well when we were there for dinner and breakfast. But we checked out the burger side for a late lunch and they were having trouble keeping up and getting orders right.The ""ranger talk"" the night we were there was a special treat: The artist in residence spoke about the program, about her artistic specialty, and a bit about her experience so far on Isle Royale. We really enjoyed the talk.A beautiful, peaceful place, but I'll bet it's a little less so later in the season.","June 29, 2017",So peaceful,36,"Austin, Texas",5

Rock Harbor,"Isle Royale National Park is the only island national part in the United States and the only national park in Michigan. The island is about 45 miles long and offers some of the most incredibly breathtaking natural scenery that mother nature has to offer. Both of the boat transportation take you to Rock Harbor. Once onland you can stay at the Rock Harbor Lodge, or go camping anywhere else on the island. No motorized vehicles are allowed on the island, so be prepared to hike. The scenery is incredible as is the wildlife. You will hear or see coyotes, wolves, moose, deer all over the island and can fall asleep to the sounds of owls or loons. If you enjoy fishing, it has some of the best in the world. If you like rock hounding, this is one of the only placing in the world in which you can find greenstones.

Rock Harbor,"We took the Isle Royale Queen IV from Copper Harbor to Rock Harbor. There we were greeted by park rangers for a quick orientation, and sent on our way. Many arrivals then went backpack hiking, and the others to the Rock Harbor Lodge, just a short, flat walk away. It was later along this paved path around the marina that I encountered a large bull moose! I was only 20 steps from him...talk about thrilling! We also saw a pair of fox playing along this stretch. It was cool, since we talked with many long distance hikers who never saw a moose or fox in all their days of hiking there, The Harbor is very clean, with deep crystal clear water. There are bathrooms, laundry, gift shop, information center right at the main pier, and very near to the other docks. The rangers are friendly and helpful. Two restaurants, under one roof, are just a couple of minutes walk from the pier, and both offer good food at reasonable prices. Really, we were surprised the prices weren't higher, being on a remote island. Make reservations for boat seating, parking in Copper Harbor, dock space, and lodging, as there are no other options after the fact. I was under the impression for years that to stay at The Island, you'd have to backpack, hike, and camp, and that just is not true at all. The Lodge is very convenient and comfy, altho at first glance it is pricey, but an overnight stay here is a lifetime opportunity, so worth the cost. There are also about 10 rustic cabins just a short walk from the pier...again, reserve in advance. Water and snacks are available on the boat, and you can pay a little extra to bring your own kayak....there are rental canoes and kayaks, and the Lodge gives you a half day canoe rental coupon.

Rock Harbor,"They told us this was the least visited, but more re-visited National Park. We could see why-it kind of settles into you in a haunting kind of way. It is very different from other parks due to the low density of people, since it is hard to get to.That's the first hurdle-you can take a boat from northern Minnesota which goes to the south tip of the Isle and then up north, basically eating up a whole day. Or you can take a boat from Houghton, Michigan which will still take I think 6 hours. Or drive up to the tip of Michigan to Copper Harbor and take 3 hours. The interior of that boat seemed OK, though just snacks on board, no food, so be forewarned. And Lake Superior is infamous for big waves and storms, so take those Dramamine pills, eh?We said the heck with that and took a seaplane from Houghton-twice the price but 35 minutes and what views! Wow! A very cool experience, unless planes freak you out. We had been to the EXCELLENT Canadian Bushplane Heritage Center in Sault Ste Marie which made it extra cool to fly in one. Anyway the time and money to get here, plus getting up to the departure points, plus the limited amount of seats available, really keep the number of visitors down.What to DO? Well, there's pretty much no WiFi or cell service or TV. There is mostly hiking, water, or serious backpacking. The whole isle is basically backpackers-only, albeit with lean-to Adirondack shelters available, because......the only lodge is at Rock Harbor, the north end of the Isle, decent rooms or cabins all with great lake views, and as is typical for in-park accommodations, expensive. Rather wildly so here, since it is so remote I guess. They even have to run their own water and sewage purification as I found out from an employee I befriended while jogging. There IS electricity and running water/toilets.Now if you are up at Rock Harbor, you can also rent canoes, kayaks, and boats with motors. Things they don't tell you:- Your stay at the lodge (2016 anyway) includes a half-day canoe rental.- Although there are canoes in the calmer Tobin Harbor, you actually have to rent the canoe or whatever at Rock Harbor marina, next to the information center and store. They give you life vests and paddles to carry to Tobin Harbor.- Checkout time is 10:30 am, so consider your time of departure accordingly. There IS a small kind of community room you can hang out in, or the restaurant porch.- It could likely rain, which might goof up your arrival and/or departure times. So DO NOT come up here with some kind of tight connection on your return! Realize that the seaplane or boats could easily be delayed due to weather and plan accordingly.There are two restaurants, actually one building and one kitchen. Prices were not horrible for being on an island and the food was good. Service, well, kind and well meaning but on Isle time meaning don't be in a hurry and sit down to eat half an hour before a boat tour.Boat tours run to different points, one tour per day. So this is another thing you can do here, besides canoe/kayak/boat. The other big things would be fishing and hiking.Trails here are mostly rough or narrow or both so frankly I would not consider this place very accommodating to wheelchairs etc. Each trail is different, and the micro-climate and plants change as you go which makes it quite interesting. I hiked to Scoville Point, to 3 Mile, and down Tobin Harbor. We also canoed to Hidden Lake and then I hiked to Lookout Louise while the others relaxed at a picnic table. One thing nobody mentioned was that the first half mile of the Lookout Louise trail is flat and easy, and everybody should try it. The last half mile has some gain, but not hugely steep. The view is worth it! You can see Canada and a big chunk of the other side of Isle Royale.You should read:- Paddle-To-The-Sea, Caldecott Honor book, originally published in 1941 and never out of print. A kids book but READ IT, especially if you are going around the Lakes and/or to Sault Ste Marie.- Nevada Barr's Winter Study (Anna Pigeon Mysteries)- Nevada Barr's A Superior Death (Anna Pigeon Mysteries)...though the Nevada Barr books will make a lot more sense if you print a map of the island as a reference while you read.Hope you go, hope you have a great time in this special place.

Rock Harbor,"We took the cruise from Copper Harbor to Rock Harbor on Isle Royale. Even though it is a longer trip than some to get to the island, the boat is faster than the others. Still, it was a 4 hour each way, trip. It is advertised as less, but if there is any fog they take a slightly longer route, adding time. Plus, once you arrive, you hear a 5 to 10 minute orientation by one of the Park Rangers. You will want to go too Pay.gov and pay your fee before arriving so that you do not add more time by having to stand in line to pay. It is all explained on the Isle Royale National Park web site. We had first thought that we would just go for a day trip. We were so glad that we decided to stay a night in the Lodge in Rock Harbor. We would have had 8 hours of travel time for about 2 hours on the island, as you arrive around noon and are supposed to be at the dock at 2:00. That really would not have given us enough time to even have a leisurely lunch, much less hike any significant trails. You will want to take along your motion sickness medication of choice. If the wind comes up, it can be pretty rocky. We had high winds coming back, and, although it never felt unsafe, it rocked the whole way back.","July 14, 2016",Memorable Trip to another great National Park,258,Texas,5

Rock Harbor,"Rock Harbor is the northern port of entry on Isle Royale. Most backpackers disembark and leave Rock Harbor immediately and return just in time to catch the boat out on their last day. That is just fine BUT, if you have the time check out Rock Harbor.There is the small store with friendly people like Peggy who are there to help you find what you need and make you feel welcome.There are showers available which is amazing after a week in the field. There are also laundry facilities. On the other side of Snug Harbor is the Greenstone Grill with its eclectic menu and reasonable prices. It is a very bright spot at the end of the Greenstone trail","September 6, 2015",Rock Harbor Rocks,33,"Edmore, Michigan, United States",5
Rock Harbor,"I'm going to write this review about the park itself since I can't find just the park on this site so....My husband and I went out on a purely reconn mission. We wanted to camp back county but never having been to the island, we decided it was best to visit it first, stay at the motel and get our bearings.Rock Harbor is very small. It's really meant as a stopping point for the trail systems and the ferry boat. The motel is very nice and clean. All rooms have a lake view, and what a view it is. They are nothing fancy, just a basic motel room. The staff is mildly helpful, but they are only on the island for a few month, then they move off to another Forever Resort property, so they really aren't the ones to as for information about the park and it's trails. For that go to the ranger station, next to the showers, laundry , trading post and ferry dock. There are maybe three trails you can do from Rock Harbor itself of varying length but none shorter than 2 miles one way , the rest you'd need to go back country or to Windago, which is at the other end of the island (no motel there though, just trading post, ferry service and showers/laundry.The trails are all at least moderate, none are easy so if your not experienced, be very careful and make sure to have a walking stick. Important piece of information for those who may be worried about safety from critters, etc... Nothing on the island can hurt you other than you. There are no ticks that bite humans, no poison ivy, no any of that. The wolves sadly are all but dead (they think there are two left) and fox, moose, beavers and birds wont bother you as long you don't bother them. There are a variety of boats you rent to go around the island, anything from canoes to motor boats.You can only get to the island by boat ( One form Minnesota (2.5 hrs) , one from Houghton, Michigan (6 plus hours. This boat is actually run by the park services) and one from Copper Harbor Michigan (3.5 hours). There is also a seaplane out of Houghton.If you are prone to motion sickness, be prepared and take your Dramamine. I didn't think it was bad at all but people all around me where not feeling their best.And speaking of weather, it is possible (dare I say probable) that you may not get to or off the island on time due to weather constraints. It is after all in the middle of THE biggest Great Lakes and gale force winds commonly delay the boats and plane. So back you time table accordingly and your patience, but hey, who doesn't want to be stuck on and island, right?!It is a spectacularly beautiful place an words can not do its rugged beauty justice. It is remote (55 miles out from Copper Harbor, Michigan in the middle of Lake Superior). It is a must for your bucket list if you like camping.Keep in mind, the number of visitors to Isle Royale in one YEAR is less that Yellowstones in a DAY. Cant wait to do it all over again and but all our gathered intel to good use.Enjoy!","September 1, 2015",Stunning remote beauty,112,"Huntington Woods, Michigan",5
Rock Harbor,Nothing but wilderness at this national park. Completely isolated in the middle of Lake Superior. Moose outnumber people by at least 10 to 1. Rangers are great.

Rock Harbor,"Marking our 52nd visit to our nation's National Parks, my wife and I booked a four day all-inclusive stay at the Rock Harbor Lodge. There are really three main ways to visit this remote park. You can spend 6 hours on the Isle Royale Queen IV and have three hours on the island. My opinion, a $130 ferry boat ride for three hours in Rock Harbor is a waste. Second, you can stay at the lodge. At age 66 that was our choice for a four day stay. Finally, if you are young and fit, getting a backcountry permit and heading toward 3 Mile Camp or Daisy Farm is a great way to go. I'll review the lodge in a separate write-up, and focus on the park for nw. My wife and I hiked every day, saw a cow moose out on Scovlille Point, and did ranger programs and Sandy Boat Tours out to Passage Island and Edisen Fishery. We saw all of the Rock Harbor area, but that really only covers 9 of the island's 45 miles. We met the Petersen's, the wolf and moose researchers, and had a fabulous visit with them. Of all the things we did, the Tobin Harbor Canoe to the Lookout Louise was THE must. Also, don't miss the Albert Stoll Memorial TTrail out to Scoville Point - simply gorgeous. So...my advide, get there while you're young, take a kayak or canoe, and head to the back country. That is the key to an A+ visit. DO NOT go for the wildlife. You will never see a wolf, there are only two left, and you will have to really work to see a moose. On the other hand, loons and snowshoe hares are a gimme. If you care about the park, let the Park Service know they must reintroduce wolves to help the Moose population.","July 27, 2015",Number 52,212,Colorado,4
Rock Harbor,"Our trip to Isle Royale started with an eight hour boat ride from Grand Portage. The boat leaves early morning and there is no food available on board so we stopped at the Spur gas station/trading post in Grand Portage and bought breakfast sandwiches and coffee plus prepackaged sandwichs for later in the day.  We threw in some chips, bottled water and a candy bar and we were set for the day. Free coffee is provided in the galley. Stocked up with food we headed to the boat. Because we were unsure of the marina's location we had stopped at the Spur station the day before our scheduled departure to scope things out. The folks at the station were very helpful. They gave us a map of Grand Portage Village and highlighted the route along Mile Creek Road and Bay Road to Hat Point Marina and Isle Royale Dock. Once at the marina we parked our car and headed for the boat. The boat made several stops on the way to Rock Harbor Lodge. A little over two hours into the trip we stopped at Windigo. This was the departure point for many of the folks who were hiking, camping and canoeing on Isle Royale. Everyone on the boat, your stop or not, met on the dock with a Park Ranger. Once the park rules were explained, park fees were collected. The National Park charges a daily user fee which they suggest you pay in advance on line. Our cost was $16.00 for two people for two days. The park rangers meet you at the dock to check receipts. You can pay in person but this appeared to create a few problems and took more time. NPS Annual passes, Senior Passes and Access Passes do not cover this fee. All official duties complete, those of us continuing on to Rock Harbor returned to the vessel. There was another 5 hours of cruising which included a brief stop to deliver and pick up mail before we reached our final destination. One thing we forgot to pay attention to; when you leave Grand Portage you are on Central daylight time. When you are on Isle Royale you are on Eastern daylight time. This works against you on the trip out by cutting one hour out of the time you have for exploring the island. It works for you on the return by departing later which allows time for a good breakfast at the restaurant.Although the area around the Rock Harbor's visitor center and gift shop can be busy, walk a few hundred yards and the crowd thins and the quiet beauty of the island starts to take hold.  Our time was limited so we hurried to our room, dumped our stuff and headed out to explore. We think the best way to know a national park is to hike the trails. There are over 165 miles of trails on the island. We would need a month and possibly new feet to see it all. Since our stay was short and new body parts were not an option a park ranger suggested the Stoll Trail to Scoville Point for our hike. The park is incredibly beautiful and we were so fortunate to have wonderful weather. There is so much to do on the island, hiking, camping, fishing, boating, swimming and scuba diving or just relax. We plan to return for a longer stay. Once back in Grand Portage, we retrieved the parking fee envelop left on our windshield, paid our parking fees and it was off to the next adventure.","July 3, 2015",The North Country's Island Paradise,498,"Phoenix, Arizona",4
Rock Harbor,"My husband and I stayed four nights at the lodge during our honeymoon. It more than exceeded our expectations. It was a perfect, peaceful getaway. The staff was both professional and fun, and we had a wonderful experience every time we interacted with them. There was even a service that brought our luggage to and from our room. All the rooms at the lodge have a balcony overlooking Lake Superior, and it was very nice to open our window at night and fall asleep to the sounds of the waves. The trailhead was only steps away from our room, making us feel very close to nature. We hope to return every year.","September 5, 2014",Perfect,10,,5
Rock Harbor,"1) Took the ferry from Grand Portage, the Voyager II. It's a seven hour trip. There is open air seating in the front and back. The back is best for those prone to sea sickness. If this is of interest to you, head straight to the back as there is limited seating. The other seating areas are inside and relatively warm. I sat outside in the back and the stability and the view were much better there. Kids travelling on the boat LOVED the front. The trip there was relatively calm, but the return had 6 foot waves. Even so, I managed to avoid getting sick. Water and coffee is available....that is it. Bring your own food and beverages. If I were to make the trip again, I think I would look into bringing a book on tape to listen to, as I am not able to read while moving.2) The harbor is nice. It is protected. There are a few gift shops (one that also sold groceries and essentials) and two restaurants. Little known fact...there is wifi in the lobby of the resort for guests of the hotel and cottages. I did not see that publicized anywhere, so thought you might like to know. The setting of the harbor is picturesque. You can rent fishing boats and non-motorized vehicles at the harbor.3) There is a great dock on the other side of island (just a five minute hike across) from the harbor where the canoes and kayaks are kept, and where you can read, lounge or fish. It is where the sea plane docks.4) There are several hikes easily accessible from the harbor. I highly recommend renting a canoe/kayak and crossing Tobin Harbor to Louise lookout. One mile hike to beautiful view.5) Stayed at the cottages with friends. Grossly overpriced, but what are you going to do? Five of us stayed in one cottage....two bunks, a queen size bed and two single roll aways. The towels were nearly thread bare, the cooking facilities and utensils barely adequate....small room....very basic....but clean....and dry!!!! A nice option if you would prefer not to camp.6) Lastly, paddeling in Tobin Harbor is like being in the boundary waters. It's nothing like being in the big open water. It's beautiful. Lots of islands, and the lake is fairly shallow in parts. One of my friends went swimming....and this was late August!","September 1, 2014",Some helpful information,31,,4
Rock Harbor,"Though we were not excited about Isle Royale, we had a beautiful room and patio overlooking Lake Superior. Though we had no towels in the room when we got there, that would be our only complaint. The staff was nice, the food was good. We enjoyed staying there. Highly suggest to check into their daily activities so you know the best days to stay there. We were there Friday-Monday, and only one activity was to visit the Rock Harbor Lighthouse and Edisen Fishery. It was ok, not an oh-wower.","August 31, 2014",Rock Harbor Lodge,31,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4
Rock Harbor,"I started and finished my trip to Isle Royale at Rock Harbor; after arriving on the Ranger III. It is a nice place to visit, but hopefully you will be able to hike and explore the rest of the island. Rock Harbor is a poor retreat spot compared to other resorts. The real reason (to me at least) to come to Isle Royale is the experience the other 99% of the island that is a wilderness and accessible only by trail. However, if you want to vacation at a spot away from cell phones and other overwhelming facets of civilization, Rock Harbor is great. I did indulge in the Grill for a wonderful pizza after 8 days of backpacking and freeze dried foods. I enjoyed it immensely and the price wasn't bad. I didn't try the restaurant. Be aware that the grill and restaurant are both in the same building, just on opposite sides. And they do shut down relatively early at night with no other options for food available.The store (by the main dock) has a very small selection of food and goods, at a higher price than on the mainland. Save it for souvenirs and other necessities that you may have forgotten. I spent my last night on the island in the Rock Harbor campground in a shelter. The campground wasn't full in June, but I'm told it does fill up during the high season. I wanted to be sure of catching the boat in the morning. I did use the public showers. $6 for a token (purchased at the camp store). I also stored a bag of clean clothes and showering gear at the lodge; $3 per day. That cost seemed a bit high, but I really did enjoy changing into clean clothes after 8 hard days on the trails. It was well worth the cost to get cleaned up and be able to sit among the normal people at the restaurant and on the boat going back. I did greatly enjoy the Ranger talk in the evening; plus it was the only entertainment available at night.","July 8, 2014",Great Starting / Ending Point for Exploring Isle Royale,90,"Coppell, Texas",4

Rock Harbor,"What a great bug free trip. We took the Ranger III out of Houghton May 31st 2014. There was a fascinating presentation by the NPS on the history of the island, how the shore line has actually increased over the years, and some cutting edge DNA testing they had done on some local copper artifacts (cutting tools) that revealed DNA evidence of what animals met their end by this ancient blade. The lecture inspired me to research more at home.  It was our first time on the Ranger III and we now prefer it over the transports out of Minnesota.  The Ranger III does not get tossed around as much as the others so no one got sea sick this time like the last few times we went out to Isle Royale on the smaller boats. We had a unfortunate canoe rental and water taxi cancellation on the part of the boat marina concessions at Rock Harbor due to the crane on the Ranger III having their repair time line pushed back, but they (especially Mr. Kim A.) were very sympathetic, refunding all of my prepaid rental/taxi money since they were not able to get their equipment out there at the start of the season as planned. We made the best of it, pushing Grandpa a little harder then we wanted to physically to get to get to our secrete fishing spot, hiking in some inflatable’s we bought from Walmart. We got into some nice Pike and celebrated his 73rd birthday in prime Pike waters making it in and out without killing the old guy. Cheap, inflatable rafts are a bad idea even on the inland channels due to the wind pushing them around. We got lucky with the wind shifting to our favor at the right times. They are even a worse idea to try to land a 25 pound treble hooked Northern Pike in. LOL.GPS was a good friend, as one of the return portages was extremely well hidden by vegetation. We reported this to the NPS along with a freshly downed tree across one of the portages. I am confident they will rectify these issues as it is quite obvious they take great pride in their park and value their customers. See attached photos for secrete fishing spot info (Pike as big as rail road ties.)All the NPS employees we met (and we spoke to a lot of them) were eager to answer questions no matter how busy they appeared to be. They all presented as being sincerely interested in making our experience the best they possibly could. $6 hot showers and beer at the end of the trip were very nice at rock harbor and worth every penny. Makes me glad to see my tax money going to support such a dedicated Federal organization.","June 7, 2014",Pike as big as rail road ties! See secrete map attached.,11,"Denver, Colorado",5
Rock Harbor,"the Ranger III is the boat from Houghton, MI to Rock Harbor, Isle Royale National Park. The ride takes 5 hrs because there is a stopover on an island used for maintenance. Lots of cargo is dropped off here. The Ranger is an extremely clean, comfortable boat. The two young girls who work in the kitchen and serve at the lunch counter, Theresa and Miriah, could not be more pleasant and helpful. The food is delicious, especially the chili and tuna salad sandwich. The crew, especially Ranger Paul is helpful and very personable. The Ranger is an excellent way to begin your adventure to Isle Royale. Plus, you will meet nice, friendly people on board who you will see again and again on the island. All are pleasant, friendly and offer a good source of sharing information and experiences.","September 5, 2013",Ranger III,56,"Clinton Township, Michigan",5

We stayed at the lodge for 3 nights (four days) and were able to get in several great hikes and a really fun canoe trip. We also took several of the boat tours (arranged through the lodge office) which were really worthwhile. The hiking, even close to the lodge, is fairly rugged. I would recommend good, sturdy shoes and come prepared for all types of weather and temperatures. Also, get the good bug spray! Mosquitos...And don't forget your camera.

Rock Harbor,"Rock Harbor is a nice place to start on Isle Royale. There is a lodge, bathroom facilities, laundry, marina, general store, picnic tables, guest house, and 2 restaurants. One thing to note re: laundry- it costs a $6 token, (yes $6!) to do one wash load of laundry. You need to buy tokens in the general store to do a wash. However, the dryer takes $2 in quarters. Also, there is no coin machine to convert quarters into tokens in the laundry area, which is really inconvenient (and certainly NOT user friendly) so you need to make sure to get this taken care of while the store is open. We lucked out when we found this out when we were about to do a load of laundry. Greenstone Grill- poor service on the 1st day we arrived due to only 1 wait staff on hand for lunch. The pizza we ordered took 45 minutes! Unacceptable! However, the next 2 times we had pizza, we had a different server and she took good care of us, so that made up for the first bad experience. The pizzas are very good and they have 3 different beers on draft, which was a nice treat for being on a remote island. There are no late night dining hours on Sunday and Monday nights, so you need adjust your day hiking schedule accordingly. Lighthouse restaurant- you need to be aware of very limited dining hours:Breakfast: 7am - 8:30am Lunch: 12pm- 1:30pm Dinner: 6pm- 7:30pm Food is great. The whitefish is good along with the fish tacos. Soups are great. Service was nice and pleasant. Desserts were ok, but we live in a big city so we may have more particular taste when it comes to dessert. All in all, the Lighthouse restaurant may be more expensive, but given that it is in a remote location, it is well worth it... definitely better than eating granola and freeze dried meals all the time!","July 13, 2013",Nice views but beware of short dining hours!,15,,4

Rock Harbor,"Isle Royale is a special place for people who love nature. This place isa MOOSE sanctuary. Yes, that is right. You will be walking around and *MOOSE!*. it's amazing.Should you choose to go here, you will have the most amazing time ever.You don't just decide to go here, you must plan, and plan a lot. Here is what you need to know:1. this is a place to go in the late spring and summer. Not a winter trip!2. The best experience is taking 2 weeks. Visit Traverse city, search for Petoskies in Petosky, and then driving to Mackinac city and stay a night at Mackinac Island. The go to Michigan UP and checking out the UP as much as you can. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. There is a guide, out of print, but it still gives you what you need to know: Hunts' Guide to Michigan's Upper PeninsulaAnd lighthouses, oh the lighthouses! Hundreds in Michigan, ALL lovely.http://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Guide-116-Michigan-Lighthouses/dp/0976962918/ref=pd_sim_b_23. Now get yourself to copper county, and check out the tons of rocks. Go look for Aggies on the beachy wonders of lake superior. Sleep in a lighthouse. Visit the rock shops and jewelry places and get rare UP rock jewels and book-ends for all your family.4. Getting to the Island:You will need a place to stay, and figure out transportation to and from the island which is limited. It is at the tippy top of the Michigan Upper Peninsula. You can take a 3 hour boat ride (across the boat-rockin' Lake Superior. You can fly in a 4 or 5 person sea plane. Either way, it's a bit scary.5. We stayed in the most expensive Park cabins, which were still pretty cheap and clearly the way to go. It was great! We had huge windows, a kitchenette, and views of the moose! It's not the ritz, but for a park experience it was great.6. Get guide books. explore, rent canoes and check out the little side islands.7. Look for rare rocks. Rare rocks, found no where else in the world, exist here. However, you are not allowed to take them. Nonetheless, it's awesome to look for them.8. Stay a while so you can get it all in. You can fish here, too, but check if you need a special stamp/license. 9. Time of year: We went in May. There is a tender time when the weather is good and the bugs haven't sprouted. When they are out, they will be out in the billions (or so it seems). Pay attention to the bug season- you can find this out online pretty easily. It varies greatly from south to north in Michigan. So, no bugs in Isle Royale doesn't mean no bugs in the UP, if you are planning a larger trip.10. Travel to the area: This is about a 14 hour drive from Detroit. Don't plan to fly into there and pop up into the UP area.11. Eat: Fresh fish. Ask around where it is served. There is nothing like fresh lake superior fish!12. Fresh air: you don't know fresh air until you've been to a place like this. It's lovely and unspoiled. **This is an ISLAND. once you are on here, you are here for the day. There is no popping over for a few hours and leaving.So, plan ahead, try and make a trip of it, and enjoy every minute. if you are there during the solar flare cycles, make sure to look for the Aurora. You should certainly see it this time of year.TIP: this place is NOT for little kids, or people with trouble ambulating. There is a lot of travel and riding on shaky canoes and boats, and you are on the frigid waters of lake superior (in the 30 degree F range!). This is a place for hiking, too. I would never personally take someone here who can't independently hike and swim and withstand a few minutes of frigid water if something goes awry. If you can't hike, you could stay in the cabin with the big windows and watch for moose, but you still need to be able to tolerate a shaky boat ride (or a plane ride), so plan ahead.","June 2, 2013","Hard to get to, harder to leave",158,da burgh,5

My favorite things about Rock Harbor was the Rock Harbor trail (stunningly beautiful), Suzy's Cave, and the abundance of wild berries!","August 13, 2012",The best national park in the entire U.S!,23,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Rock Harbor,"Isle Royale National Park is a great place to get away from civilization, relax, and enjoy nature. The lodge is a bit rustic (we had a deer mouse in our room), but its part of the charm. While at Isle Royale make sure to rent a canoe or kayak and check out Tobin Harbor, which has a great history. Ask one of the rangers about the cabins. Stop at Lookout Louise/Hidden Lake and look for moose. And if the water is calm enough in Rock Harbor, paddle out to Raspberry Island to see the carnivorous plants. We also took a guided trip out to Passage Island, which was fun too. Make sure to check out the nightly ranger programs at Rock Harbor. All of the rangers and volunteers were knowledgable and enthusiastic about Isle Royale and the programs were great!","August 11, 2012",Isle Royale is a hidden gem,91,"Neenah, Wisconsin",5

Rock Harbor,"A lifetime dream came true in the summer of 2011 as I visited Isle Royale with my sons, my brother, and my nephew. The adventure starts with the ferry ride. A storm the night before had the lake waters riled up with 4-5 foot swells. The ferry looks big at the dock, but it felt kind of small bobbing around on the waves of the foggy lake.To camp on Isle Royale please be prepared. To camp on Isle Royale please be prepared. While certainly a beautiful place Isle Royale has hazards at any time of the year. It's rarely warm, the lake water is cold, nearly unswimmable, the trails rugged, the amenities non-existent (away from the ferry docks), cell phones don't work, you can't build campfires, a simple accident like a broken leg can be an ordeal of epic proportions, there's no drinking water other than water you treat or filter, voracious mosquitoes, biting flies, etc. etc. And to top it off the island is big. Any emergency might mean you're many hours away from help. Although I went as a novice, I was off work that summer. I had ample time to read and to plan. Once again to camp on Isle Royale please be prepared.Now that I have the warnings out of the way here's what we loved about our time there.The lake shore is spectacular. It's beautiful reddish rocks, cliffs, and pebble beaches.The lake water is amazingly clear. Visibilities appear to be 25 feet or more.The trails are well built and maintained. That being said, an island 45 miles long with dozens of miles of trails means that trees will fall on the trail that haven't been cleared.The views from Greenstone Ridge invite the eyes to vistas that stretch 40 or 50 miles. The mainland of Michigan was faintly visible one afternoon, a distance of 50 miles or so.The campsites are private, and occupy picturesque postcard views.The northern latitude of the park lessened the desire for a fire when daylight lingered in the sky until nearly 11:00. The shelters at some campgrounds are perfectly set up for the thru hiker not wanting to spend time to set up camp or a dry place to camp in rainy weather.The paddling opportunities are endless, although we didn't do any paddling on the trip. The escape from society is overwhelming. We saw a few people, we were the only campers one night, A few tips for the backpacker:If you can manage to lug a chair in a bag you will appreciate it after a long day of hiking.One can of high quality bug spray per backpack. Of course if you're there early or late in the season it's not an issue.Get your hiking boots months before and break them in. Hiking socks. I had a pair, my brother didn't. He had blisters, I didn't.Buy stuff you might need, keep the receipts, then return if you don't use. We had rain suits for each member of our party, but we didn't need them. At 20 bucks a piece the returned merchandise added up.Our .02 micron pump filter worked well. At one point I was extremely thirsty as we hiked up the ridge. I was out of water, we crossed a stream just below a beaver dam. It wasn't the most appetizing looking water, but the filter did the trick. I'd a been dehydrated if I hadn't used it.The simple park map we used was adequate for our needs. The trails are very well marked and the woods are incredibly thick. There is very little temptation to wander off trail.Follow the rules. Our remote campsite tempted us to break the no campfire rule. The next day a ranger showed up in a boat checking on us. Had we built a fire we'd have been busted.It's the kind of place that can be miserable if you're not ready. If you're not that type, try the lodge at Rock Harbor and go out for day hikes, although even then you've got to be prepared to drink and have bug spray.If you are prepared you'll have the time of your life and create corresponding memories.","April 26, 2012",Isle Royal National Park,25,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana",5
Rock Harbor,"This is the most beautiful park I have ever been in! I wish I had more time there. It is well worth the ferry cost (65 plus marina fee of 4) if you are camper,scuba diver or hiker. you will fall in love with this park! The leaves were in brillant color some of the campers had seen moose. The rangers have an excellant program!","September 25, 2011",most beautiful national park,37,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Rock Harbor,"Spent two night at Rock Harbor Lodge on Isle Royale. What a wonderful place, the staff was fantastic, the food was excellent, and the National Park is beautiful. Can you tell I liked the place. Rooms at Rock Harbor sit right on the water with beautiful views of Lake Superior. It is a 55 mile ferry ride from Copper Harbor to the island and that is part of the fun. Spent two days hiking the trails around Rock Harbor. Next time definately want to get into the back country by either sea kayaking or taking the local ferry. The park closes for the year in early September so labor day weekend was a great time to go. The weather was still good but the lodge was only about 1/3 full.","September 19, 2011",Isle Royale National Park & Rock Harbor Lodge-Incredible!!,109,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Rock Harbor,"Took our family of 16 to help celebrate our golden anniversary. Spent 3 days, 2 nights. We love our National Parks and this one did not disappoint. Hiking trails were beautiful. The setting on Lake Superior was wonderful. The lodge balcony overlooking the lake was a great place to sit in the evening and enjoy the scenery while visiting with family. Canoeing to Hidden Lake and Lookout Louise was fun for all. Perfect destination for all ages.","August 11, 2011",Perfect 50th Anniversary Trip,12,"Chicago, Illinois",5
