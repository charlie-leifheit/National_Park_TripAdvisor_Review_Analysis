Great Basin National Park,"We stopped there for some scenery and hiking. Planned on 2 nights but the weather closed in and we were afraid of being trapped by snow. We went first to the lower campground-about 3 miles off the road. The sign said there was vacancy so we braved the mildly steep gravel road to find a spot for our trailer. When we got there, there was only 1 space left. It was on a 1 way road and the spot was backward to the direction of traffic, so there was no way to back in. We headed back down the road to another CG- then another. both were full. We decided to head up to the last CG on a moderately steep winding road. We got to the top at 9800 ft and found it to be quite beautiful with the Aspen trees changing color and the High-Wheeler Peak in view. (13,000 ft) We have a 19 ft trailer and it was slow going through the switchback but the road was paved. It was a chilly night ( In the 20's) and the clouds rolled in expecting snow the next day. We decided to hike in the AM and leave before the snow hit. Glad we did. It was a windy cloudy day. we hiked up to about 11,000 ft to the bristle cone forest-quite nice-about 2 miles up. Then on the way down took a couple of side trails to 2 lakes. It was the end of the season and cloudy so not too beautiful. On the way down the hill-a little scary, we stopped at the Lehman Caves visitor center-the tours were sold out so we did not see the caves. We wished we could have stayed longer and hiked to the top of Wheeler peak but the weather was not conducive. Next time!","October 7, 2019",Out of the way but worth it,179,"Truckee, California",5
Great Basin National Park,"We've wanted to go to Great Basin National Park for a long time, and finally made it this fall. The aspens, at peak, had just begun to shed their glorious golden leaves at the highest elevations. Patchy snow, in a few places, made the walk to the ancient bristlecone pine trees more brisk and beautiful, while lacy ice on the edges of creeks sparkled in the sunshine. The alpine lakes reflected the sky, mountains, and trees.Glorious!Lehman Cave was amazing, and Crystal Ball Cave, less than an hour away, was a fun adventure too!Glad we finally did it!!!Three nights gave us two full days in the park, which was about enough for us.I'd like to return.","October 7, 2019",Remote Gem!,98,"Logan, Utah",5
Great Basin National Park,"I've now visited Great Basin National Park twice. It's in an inconvenient location, which has helped it to avoid the many huge crowds that have made other, better known parks harder to enjoy today. Great Basin, as of 2017, had 168,028 visitors throughout the year. Yosemite, that same year, had 4,479,242 visitors and Yellowstone had 4,116,524. Great Basin NP is an hour's drive from the nearest town of any real size, Ely NV, which has several good-sized motels and hotels. It's about a 3.75 hour drive from Salt Lake City with a full-service airport, or 4.5 hours from Las Vegas. OTOH, if you plan ahead and are willing to stay in older, smaller properties, you can drive to Baker NV and be just minutes from the park's visitor center in Baker itself. Even the Lehman Caves Visitor Center is just 5 miles away from Baker.So, why travel so far? Lehman Caves were worth the fee (currently $11 for adults, less for senior and kids). They have a safe cement trail with handrails and stairs, making it possible for this senior citizen to walk through the caves. The guides are knowledgeable and excited to share the wonders with us neophytes. The roads are well maintained and lead to numerous trailheads. The views are fantastic, and because of altitude changes there are multiple environments to explore with an incredible variety of animals and foliage, including bristlecone pines.Because we stayed in a motel in Baker, I can't tell you much about the campgrounds, but you can easily find out about them through the park's website.Finally, what brought me to Great Basin NP? The incredible night skies! The park is an International Dark Sky Park. That means, when the clouds cooperate, you can easily see the stars and planets, and deep sky objects (galaxies and nebulas). During the warmer months the park sponsors star parties and an astronomy festival each September during the week of the new moon. Dozens of volunteers bring their telescopes for the public to use during the festival.","October 6, 2019",A Nearly Hidden Gem,11,"Provo, Utah",5

Great Basin National Park,"A couple of disclaimers: I did not do a cave tour. I frequently travel in the eastern Sierra so it is had not to compare GBNP to the Sierra.I camped 2 nights at Baker Creek to attend the Astronomy Festival. Hiked to Stella Lake from the Bristlecone parking lot. (I have seen Bristlecones before so the lake hike sounded better for me.) The festival had a good variety of events. Attended an interesting daytime talk. Lucked out with weather and had good conditions for the night time viewing. Good set up and lots of volunteers with telescopes. The sky was a bit hazy and I thought I would be more impressed with the dark sky and viewing with naked eye. It was very good just not as ""wow"" compared to other opportunities I have had. The viewpoints for Wheeler Peak weren't that great. There is a short window for the sunlight on the mountain from the road. The park is ok but most of the Sierra is more impressive so once is enough for me. I'm not saying don't go, just that I enjoy the Sierra and many other places I have been more. Just my opinion & comparison - your results may vary!","October 2, 2019",Worth a Stop If You're In the Area,36,"Reno, Nevada",3

Great Basin National Park,"This is the most beautiful and the least visited park in the national park system, which is why we love this park so much. You can find hikes in the mountains where you may never see another person, which is what most people really want. Most national parks are so overcrowded that the only enjoyment is leaving! We love it here so please stay away.","September 6, 2019",AWESOME,62,"Port Clinton, Ohio",5
Great Basin National Park,"I wasn't sure what to think of GBNP prior to our visit, but I was pleasantly surprised everywhere we went! We traveled over Labor Day weekend with a 16-year-old, a 13-year-old, and a 7-year-old. One of the first things we noticed was that it wasn't crowded at all, which was very refreshing. We booked our tour of Lehman Caves in advance, so we didn't have to worry about whether or not the cave tours were full, but when we arrived on Saturday morning for our slot, there were still several tours during the day that had spots available. Lehman Caves are awesome and definitely something you don't want to miss while in GBNP! We did the full 90 minute tour and you are walking and exploring the entire time. I did notice that there were several people on our tour who appeared to be struggling with all of the walking, but my family of five did just fine. Some of the cave formations were unlike any other cave that we have seen, and we all loved what we saw. During the afternoon that we were there, we decided to hike the 4 mile (round trip) hike to the ancient Bristlecone pines near Wheeler Peak. Again, this was 100% worth the trip. The hike was very manageable and completely worth it. Some of the oldest pines are labeled, and there is a lot of information about various trees at the top. The trail is groomed very well. I would definitely recommend visiting GBNP. We already have plans to go back for another quick trip and summit Wheeler Peak.

Great Basin National Park,"This is a low-key and less-visited park than many others in the west. It was fantastic. I drove up the Scenic Road to the parking lot at the end and hiked up to the Bristlecone Pine grove. Wonderous and amazing and beautiful. Since it was Saturday night, I came back and enjoyed the astronomy program just looking up at the Milky Way and a million stars while waiting for my turn to view a few different objects through a telescope. This park may be in ""the middle of nowhere"" but I highly recommend it.","September 3, 2019",Blue Skies and Bristlecones,0,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Great Basin National Park,"I went on this trek with a couple of friends and it was a fun experience. The high starting altitude (8000ft) and the weight of the camping equipment made this somewhat difficult trail slightly more difficult.Despite that, the view of the night sky from the top was excellent. We reached the lake around 10:00 pm and had to walk around a bit to search for a camping spot. Would recommend others to get here before the sun sets, in order to make finding suitable camping spots easier (most of the areas near the lake were rocky).If possible, try to camp here on a new moon night. That would help make the star gazing experience even better.","September 3, 2019",Hike to Baker Lake,0,"San Francisco, California",4
Great Basin National Park,"This park was unexpected jewel. There is nice visitor center in Baker and then you go up to elevation of 10,000 ft on very nice road with many switchbacks and steep. At top is the interpretive trail of bristlecone pine trees-beautiful and unbelievably old. Continue on trail to base of southern most glacier in US. Glacier might be small in comparison to those up north but still a glacier. Did not go to caves were impressed enough with trails. Would love this go again.

Great Basin National Park,"The Great Basin National Park is a beautiful park with many trails. We really wanted to hike to the Bristle Cone Trees, but the trail was closed, so that was a disappointment. We did get to see other parts of the park, lots of streams and lakes, but it does take some hiking. We did see a lot of deer in the park and they don't seem to be afraid of people, so if you like taking photos of wildlife you can get some beautiful pictures.The scenery at the park is incredible and you can enjoy it without being squeezed out by crowds.

Great Basin National Park,We love visiting national parks and now Great Basin is one of our favorites. It is so nice to enjoy such breathtaking scenery without the crowds.

Great Basin National Park,"Great Basin became a National Park in 1986. Its relatively isolated location attracts only 200,000 visitors per year. That’s approximately 95% fewer visitors than what Yellowstone gets. Perhap that is why this park does not collect a fee, although there is an optional donation box in the visitor center. There are three not-to-be-missed features in the park: Lehman Caves, the bristlecone forest, and the night sky. I’ve been to a number of caves, but Lehman is my favorite that’s available for public tour. It is loaded with formations, many of them are rare (shields, helictites, anthodites). The ranger typically turns out the lights on the tour so you can experience total darkness (don’t worry—while standing still). It’s awesome! The bristlecone forest can be reached by at 2.8 mile roundtrip hike with some elevation gain. There is a short interpretive trail to provide more information about these grand twisted trees, many of which are thousands of years old. The night sky is amazing because Great Basin is a declared dark sky site. They don’t have any upward pointing white lights that can wash out the stars. In addition, several nights a week the rangers give an astronomy talk outdoors at the Lehman Caves visitor center. After the talk, the rangers will let you look through one of their telescopes to see such things as Jupiter and Saturn. Even without the telescope, you can use your naked eye to see the Milky Way and search for the shapes of the constellations.One additional feature of the park is that the main visitor center offers a chance to look at the sun safely through a solar telescope.","August 6, 2019",Free and Uncrowded,283,"Los Gatos, California",5

Great Basin National Park,"Within the course of about a 45 minute drive, one leaves the desert floor below and ascends into an alpine setting complete with crisp air, lakes, and bristlecone pines. Great Basin National Park boasts 2 unique items. The oldest known living organisms on the planet of bristlecone pines (which are not marked for obvious reasons) and the Western Hemisphere’s southernmost glacier. The glacier, a remnant of the last ice age, is a site to see by itself. The drive up without stops takes about 30 minutes with plenty of places to stop and enjoy the view along the way. At the top there are many places to camp, facilities to use, and trails to lead into the wilderness. As with any park, take lots of water with you.

Great Basin National Park,"Great Basin National Park is located between Ely and Baker, Nevada, very close to the Utah state line only about 5 hours northeast of Las Vegas, NV. We stayed at Hidden Canyon resort just outside Garrison, Utah, which was just minutes from the park entrance and about 2.5 hours from Brian Head, UT.. The area is sparsely populated and the largest town near the park is an hour away at Ely. Ely has some of the chain motels while Hidden Canyon is more like a bed and breakfast arrangement and much more convenient to the park.The park is famous for its expansive views of the great basin area, but the original park likely owes its existence to the Lehman Caverns which was the basis of the original National Monument designation in 1922. The greater National Park which incorporates the Caverns was created in 1986. This is a lovely area and is not heavily visited so it was easy to navigate. The drives into the park are scenic with lovely stops and opportunities to hike a bunch of different trails with a range of difficulty levels. The mountains rise to elevations over 13000 feet.This was our first experience with a cavern tour and we were impressed by the experience as well as the history of this exhibit. The Ranger did a good job of explaining what we were seeing. The caverns were first explored in the 1800's when the only way to enter was to drop down about 150 feet into a hole. The current tour is somewhat easier and lasts about 90 minutes. A shorter, hour long tour is available. Magnificent to see! A bit of a trek to get there but the journey is worth the effort since the scenery along the way is outstanding..

Be sure to reserve 2-3 days or more in advance. Camp sites were nice. Some are pull through. Cave tours are informative and take about an hour.

Great Basin National Park,"A friend once told me about a well kept secret about a not so well known, nor well traveled National Park-GREAT BASIN in in South East Nevada. Since I had time to spare on my way home from Utah during Spring Break, I decided to see for myself. At first I was taken aback after driving a long lonely highway for some 25 or 30 miles off Interstate 15. The ranger at the Visitor Center said everything was still snowed in. RATS! But that 's hardly the end of the story. I discover natural beauty in Baker. It has oodles of original settlement log cabins all around town- unspoiled, natural. For a photography buff like me it was awesome. Now the best part. Lehman cave was open. You can only enter with a Ranger guide, and the groups have to be small. Also, usually you should make reservations, but I got lucky. There was space. Long story short, the cave is beyond words. Mother Nature, the greatest sculptor, I think, made what took her millions of years to create. And what a sight to behold...for all of us to enjoy.

Also, since it’s a smaller park, it doesn’t take too long to explore, unless you like to take long hikes, etc. We were there in May so we weren’t able to drive to the top since there was still snow up there. The Lehman Cave tour was great. I would highly recommend making a reservation though. All the tours were full when we were there even though it was before Memorial Weekend.

With limited mobility, there wasn’t much access to the Park for Mom.Yes, I know this was an exceptional snow load year but I was supremely disappointed the Park Service won’t plow “our” roads open.

The basin itself looked pretty bland apart from the very angry badger we spotted popping out of its hole. The Lehman cave tour was great and our guide Charlie was very passionate and knowledgeable about caves. You could take photos which was also great as this wasn’t permitted at kartchner caverns. Given the remoteness of its location, the fact that it has such a short season to access the summit drive and given the elevation of most of the hikes I don’t think you could justify the huge drive to get to the park unless like us you were already passing through.","April 20, 2019",Great caves- but scenery a little boring ,53,"Brisbane, Australia",4

Great Basin National Park,"I'm new to actually commenting on sites like this but feel I MUST do my due diligence. GREAT BASIN NP is sooooo, very worth the trip. We ""hit it"" on the way back to Ca. from Utah NPs and so very glad we did. Truth be told, I took this trip in the summer of 2015.I was so moved spiritually by this place. No crowds, tucked away in the 'middle of nowhere.' All that is true. If you are going to GB NP you are going JUST to see IT. It is a destination-for sure-not part of another journey. We did and saw everything that was available. The Lehman Cave tour and stories of the prohibition era speakeasy that went on in the there. We had an EXCELLENT ranger! Easy hikes on well maintained trails. Driving to over 10,000 feet in elevation.And the story of the Bristlecone Pine tree...an education in and of itself deserving of its own paragraph in this review. After hiking among the Bristlecone Pine Trees, we hit the visitors' center where we saw this timeline made of a section of the tree. I literally shed tears. It is a beautiful tribute to all humanity NOT TO BE MISSED. The tree was over 6000 yrs. old....I mean...Noah and his 3 kids could have planted that tree!!! Just imagine!!I would like to go back but almost don't want to because my experience there was so moving. In a way, I just want to preserve my memory of my experience there.Also, though it is 'in the middle of nowhere' the last bit of straight drive up there is lined with quirky local art. Don't miss those! It was hilarious.","November 19, 2018",Truly AWE Inspiring and moving experience,10,,5
Great Basin National Park,"We have a goal of visiting all the national parks in the contiguous USA. So, we needed to visit this one. It truly is in the middle of nowhere. For whatever reason, “maps” said it would take 6 hours from Vegas to get there. It took us about 4 hours going, and 4 hours back. There in lies the problem. Unless you have a goal like we do, I suggest you skip this trip and go to Death Valley, Grand Canyon or even parks in Utah as they are much nicer. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a nice park, just not worth the drive. I rented a Mercedes convertible from Hertz at the vegas airport. I think it cost about $85 for the day, unlimited miles. It made the ride so much more enjoyable.","November 12, 2018","Nice, but is it worth the trip?",8,,3
Great Basin National Park,"I have a pro photographer friend whose images of Great Basin had me interested in visiting. We knew that the weather might not cooperate and that was somewhat true in that a storm the week before had left about a foot of snow above 10,000', limiting access to the high country except on foot. We had fine hikes on brisk sunny days up Baker Creek and on the trail connecting the upper campgrounds (Wheeler and Lehman) and onto the Bristlecones. Will be back sometime to get up Wheeler Peak and do other exploring.","November 9, 2018",Snow in October,8,"Snohomish, Washington",5
Great Basin National Park,"The ‘edge’ that this park has on the others in the Great Basin is that it is in the lower Snake Valley and is the site of Bristlecone Pines and the Lehman Cave. The displays are clearly written, the film is enjoyable, and the staff is friendly. Lehman Cave is available by scheduled tour only though, so plan ahead. There are plenty of campsites and it’s a beautiful park. ","October 29, 2018",Stunning vistas and displays ,41,"El Cerrito, California",4
Great Basin National Park,"Went through here on a road trip and thought it was a wonderful place - remote, desolate, sometimes beautiful and occasionally eerie. Tried a visit to Lehman cave as it was very late September and thought the place would be deserted. How wrong I was as the tour was full, should have heeded the warnings and booked in advance. Some very long distances between gas stations (over 150 miles at one time) so best to fill up when you can. A word of warning for non US residents; number of gas pumps are totally unattended and cannot be used without a zip code alongside your card so are useless for non US based people. We had a huge rain storm during our trip which made the road almost undriveable so don't think the desert is always dry. :-)","October 18, 2018",Stunning - but a bit out of the way.,265,"Bisley, United Kingdom",4
Great Basin National Park,"One of the least known of our National Parks, but an amazing place! The hiking is superb! Do not miss the hike to the famous bristle cone pines (4000-5000 years old) and a tour of Lehman Cave. One of the most enjoyable activities is the Night Sky viewing, presented by the rangers. Two telescopes are set up to let you view the heavens.

Great Basin National Park,"This park is isolated. The nearest town is small. It's near highway 50, billed as the ""loneliest road in America."" No major hotel chains. No well known fast food places. Gasoline is available at a pump kiosk with no store or building associated with it. Credit or debit only.The beauty of this place is worth it though. Ironically, there are *two* visitor centers. One is in the park. The other is on the northern outskirts of Baker, along highway 487. We did not stop at the one in Baker.There are a number of things to do here: 1) Visit the visitor centers, which are well staffed and interesting, at least the one in the park was, so I have to guess that the other is also. 2) There is a cafe and gift shop next door to the visitor center in the park. They oddly enough have a collection of serious board games, such as Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride. I asked about that. Some are for sale, but the campers at the park like to play them, so they make them available. 3) There are hiking trails. 4) There is a scenic drive. 5) There is a cave tour. 6) Sky viewing at night. You can see the Milky Way here. (And most of Nevada.)We did not go on the cave tour. My wife cannot do that sort of walking for any distance. I got the impression that in spite of the remoteness of this place, that the cave tour fills up fast. We drove up the scenic drive. It ends by a campground with trail heads. Be warned: if your passenger has a fear of heights, this might not be for you. (Or more, for them.) The road has some places where it hugs drop offs. It is a well maintained road, though, except in one place, the Mather Overlook. This went down somewhat steeply and had lots of potholes, so we turned around. The rest of the road is fine. the aspen was just turning colors, so it made for beautiful views.

The drive through southern Utah was beautiful- particularly compared to our expectations. Mountains were always in sight.At the park, we did the Wheeler Peak drive and the Bristlecone Trail. It was among the prettiest places we saw on our trip. The info on the Bristlecone is trees - the oldest on Earth was interesting and well presented. Fall colors were starting to show in Mid Sep, the only place we saw them.

The rooms were large enough to stand up in although some of the passages required stooping. It was amazing to be up so close to the rock formations. We were able to see the details so clearly.

Great Basin National Park,"What a pleasant surprise. I gotta admit, I planned a trip just to knock off another national park and this is one you have to specifically plan to go to, you're never going to be conveniently driving by. I'm usually going to enjoy myself when I'm outdoors camping, but Great Basin National Park it turned out, had a little of everything, a cave tour, an evening sky show with telescopes, the ""forgotten"" Winchester, bristlecone pines and frankly for me being an east coaster seeing western trees in general. Turkeys were walking blithely through my campsite, even saw a bull elk by the side of Wheeler road. The campsites were wonderful, well spaced apart, level, smooth, able to get tent pegs in - no gravel - and water that was pretty tasty from the spigots placed close by. One problem, no showers, I mean, I understand that and you don't get nearly as sweaty in the drier, cooler air than we get back east in the humidity. I was happy to get to a hotel shower after three days though.And of course, there was the hiking, Wheeler Peak for a little ""high"" adventure, I'm thinking 13k is the highest altitude I've ever climbed to, Heck, my campsite at Upper Lehman at 7k was already higher than any mountain on the east coast. (There might have been nicer campsites but as soon as I saw UL, I thought don't look a gift horse in the mouth, just take it) Other hikes go by alpine lakes and to the mini glacier. I enjoyed Kerouac's Restaurant in the town of Baker which I've reviewed elsewhere. Also, hit the archeological site on the way out. As I said, a little of everything.I've probably done some of these things that were bigger or better elsewhere but something was easier going about GBNP. Maybe it's just off the beaten path enough that it wasn't crowded and many of the activities were more manageable because of that. I even felt that with the park rangers, probably a good gig for them, like they had ownership of the place, more time to talk with you and were enthusiastic, Glad I added an extra day, that is, stayed 3 nights with two full days. Got all of the above in including just sitting at the campsite on a warm afternoon getting in a little reading. Bought a copy of John McPhee's book ""Basin and Range"" at the visitor center which I'm now close to finishing. Interesting area I'm learning a lot more about. (Hi Jamie!)As I said, it's a tough get, don't know when - if ever - I'll be back but have wonderful memories.

Our first day we did the South Fork Baker Loop, which was 5 miles of forest and meadow hiking, partly following a nice little brook. Saw wild turkeys and deer. Our next hike was to the Rock Glacier, which brought us past the Bristlecone Pine Grove. Quite rocky in spots, and a bit hard on the ankles, but definitely worth hiking. We had a peaceful lunch along Teresa Lake. Our last day, half our group hiked to Wheeler Peak, while the rest hiked Osceola Ditch Trail. Both groups raved about the views. One night during the stay, we went out stargazing. Seeing the Milky Way and few shooting stars made for a magical evening - we never see this many stars back home!

Almost immediately, I was entranced with Great Basin National Park on Nevada's eastern edge. The combination of 13,000-feet peaks, forests, trails and the Lehman Caves exceeded expectations. The weather in July was perfect, and we even got a rain storm one afternoon. The tour of the caves was amazing. We loved the different rock formations and the way the cave is recovering from visitors a century ago. Above ground, we got in some great day hikes. It also afforded us the chance to see the oldest living organisms. Bristlecone Pine trees are ugly and amazing. They have been standing here, slowly growing in this inhospitable area for 4,000 years.

Some of the trails are very accessible (there's even a scenic driving trail up to Wheeler Peak and a wheelchair accessible trail near the campground there), but many are pretty difficult. Lots of fist-sized rocks to walk/scramble/hike over. But the views are absolutely incredible! The land is really beautiful and definitely a must-see.

Great Basin National Park,"Great Basin National Park has a lot to offer. Spend a couple of days there, but be aware that lodging is quite limited. If you are a camper there are plenty of spots to pitch a tent or park a trailer. Restaurants are also limited, but there are a couple of places to get some average food. Attached to one of the restaurants is a market to get groceries and other supples, but be warned it is small and does not offer a great selection.Getting to the park involves a drive through a dry, arid desert on one-lane highways. Some people find this unbearable, personally I don't mind it. Either way, if you have the mettle to make the drive what you have waiting for you is an uncrowded park with amazing starry nights, Native American pictographs, a super cool cave to explore, great camping and more.A few recommendations:1) Bring enough food for your stay. As mentioned above food choices in Baker are limited.2) Come prepared with water. Water is available at visitors centers and trail heads, but still come prepared with water.3) Do the 90 min tour in Lehman Caves. I've done the 90 min and 60 min and they both left me wanting more time.4) Cave tours accommodate 20 people max. Don't wait to book your tour at the park. The tours can fill up quickly.5) If you don't like to camp check out Hidden Canyon Retreat. They offer clean rooms, breakfast and have wild turkeys and other wildlife roaming the property. Just be careful you don't run over any jackrabbits and be sure to reserve your room well in advance.6) Take your time at the park. There are easy, mostly flat hiking trails as well as more difficult trails. Go for a hike, enjoy the views and take it all in.7) Do the Star Show!!! Can't emphasize this enough. The Milky Way Galaxy is amazingly thick with stars. Very little light pollution, low humidity and high altitude make this a premier location to see the stars. After the show park rangers will pull out three high-power telescopes for visitors to see.8) Go to the Star Show your first night there and be sure to bring chairs. Because you're following my advice to stay a couple nights, if it's not a clear night, you will have a second chance to see the stars. Also the presenters change from night to night. I've had an amazing presentation that captivated my 6-year old daughter, and I have had a presentation that was a complete waste of time.

You are hiking above 10000 feet so novice hikers, spend a little time acclimating before taking off on the hikes. You will feel the altitude.

Even if it is 100 degrees outside in the middle of the summer, you might want to bring a jacket because it is cold inside. I would like to go back and take the ninety (90) minute tour in the future just to see what else is down there. You need to book your tour online to ensure that you have a ticket for you and your loved ones. I am sure that sometimes you can walk up and purchase tickets during the middle of the week, but if you are going with a large group I strongly recommend that you purchase your tour tickets online ahead of time to ensure that you get to go on the tour Visit the cafe/gift shop next door. They have a kids menu for the little ones. I had the house chili and it was great! Plus, I am not sure how many national parks serve beer at their cafe, but this one sure does. They serve Great Basin Brewery products brewed in Reno, Nevada. They also have a lot of other activities to do at the park. You can drive up to the peak of the mountains. They offer star gazing tours at night and there is also plenty of hiking to do as well. It is a bit of a drive from Las Vegas, Nevada.

The three main attractions in the park are: The Bristlecone grove on the Bristlecone trail, Wheeler Peak Trail, and Lehman Caves. Hiking the strenuous Wheeler Peak trail would almost be a full day affair (6-7 hrs). The Bristlecone trail is a little over a mile, but pretty steep. Awesome to see the more than 3,000 year old trees at the Bristlecone Grove. Lehman Caves are wonderful, and worth the paid guided tour. They are very popular, so reserve in advance on-line.

You probably won't get tickets if you wait to go the day of (especially on summer weekends). Anyway, the drive up to Wheeler Peak is very scenic, albeit a little bit white-knuckle-y. Do the Alpine Lakes Loop hike once up there, it is very pretty.

But once there, we were glad we made the trip. The scenic drive to the Wheeler Peak camp ground is filled with switch-backs and grand views of the valley below and the peaks above. Studded with aspen (which were in a pale yellow spring color), this must be a spectacular drive in the fall. Major fault: the NPS film was not at all clear or helpful explaining what the ""Great Basin"" is, except for a throw-a-way line. There should be a clear map indicating the area considered the ""Great Basin"", why it is called that, and the significance. We did learn all of this from the displays, but it would have been more helpful in the film.

It's right at the upper visitor's center so it's an easy drive in - drive out stop. The real magic is everywhere else. Drive up to Wheeler Peak Campground and hike a couple miles to the bristlecone pine grove. Some of those trees are over 3000 years old. There are two other stands of them in the park. Currently you have to bushwhack to them, though I think they are building a trail to the Mt. Washington stand. There are pictographs and unmapped cavern systems all over the park. There are alpine lakes, antelope and incredible views; but you really need to leave the car behind, put on a pack and explore to appreciate it. There are the stars, of course. And there is the silence. Take a moment to listen to nothing but birds and wind. My wife and I came here 30 years ago and fell in love with the place.

The higher locations of the park where the celebrated bristlecone pines are found were unfortunately closed till later in the year, but the next morning we were able to hike some of the lower elevation trails in the far eastern portion of the park.

In winter there's not much to do as the back country is mostly closed.The Lehman Cave Visitor Center is a nice little Center with very knowledgeable Rangers (who like to talk to you in winter since there aren't many visitors) and a number of videos. The main Park video is quite nice (always a great introduction to a Park and one of the first things we do upon visiting a National Park). In addition, there were a number of ""Ranger Minutes"". Short videos on specific topics - night skies, winter in the Park, the bristlecone pine, ranching and mining. The short videos gave us a much better feel for the place.Took a hike to a petroglyph cave (not much) and took the Cave tour.Nice visit.

Great Basin National Park,"We visited Great Basin in January, and unfortunately, the road up to the top was closed due to snow and ice. We were able to do the tour of Lehman Cave, which was really well done. We had a ranger intern for our tour guide, and she was very knowledgeable and excited to share stories about the cave. The whole tour is about 90 minutes, with the first 20 minutes or so outside the cave going over basic cave and safety information. Once inside the cave, you visit several ""rooms"" in the cave. There are a good many steps, both up and down, to access the areas on the tour. A few places are a bit of a squeeze to get through, and if you are over 5'3"" or so, you will have to bend down (but not squat) a good bit to keep from hitting your head. No matter what time of year you visit the park, try to do the cave tour.NOTE: You have to make reservations in advance as each tour is only 20 people. Our tour was sold out even in January! Don't go to the park assuming you can just get a ticket there for the tour.Also, this is the 12th national park we have visited, and it is by FAR the most remote. There is a cafe at the park, but it was closed when we were there. The crossroads of Baker is just outside the park, but it was basically a ghost town when we came through (maybe in summer it would be different?). We came from the Delta, Utah area to reach the park, and it was a two hour drive from Delta -- we should have bought lunch items and carried them with us!

Great Basin National Park,"There is a lot to see and do at Great Basin in a small area compared to other National Parks. We spent about half a day there after driving in from Las Vegas. This park has NO entrance fee (free). There are two visitor centers: one at the park entrance (Rt. 488) in Baker and another at Lehman Caves. The one at the caves is larger (and more crowded) because that is where they stage the cave tours (fee) and there is also a cafe' on site. We didn't go into the cave because the tour is only partially wheelchair accessible. I suggested that they produce a DVD of the tour and offer it for sale as an option for those who have mobility challenges or who miss the tour. (Note that advance reservations for cave tours are strongly-recommended as the tours routinely sell out.) We took the spectacular 12-mile scenic drive up Wheeler Peak. Be aware that this is a narrow, curvy 2-lane mountain road with steep drop-offs, but it is paved and well-maintained (35 mph, no vehicles over 24' length). There are 2-3 overlooks along the way to view the surrounding peaks and valleys. The scenic drive ends on Wheeler Peak at 10,000' elevation. There among the aspens is a parking area, restrooms, a campground and several trail heads. We took the beautiful Island Forest Trail through pine trees and along a small stream and watched a foraging doe. This trail is 1/4 mile and wheelchair-accessible. There are several other trails in the park of varying lengths and difficulty; consult the park website for descriptions. Keep in mind that it is much cooler at the peak and the sun is intense at that elevation. The road to Wheeler Peak is closed in winter but usually open by Memorial Day, check conditions before going.

Lodging extremely limited. Be very careful of descriptions and photos online at all sites. Read thoroughly to avoid gleaming generalities. Park visitor center in town only open during season, so know that Caves center fills the role the rest of the year.

Great Basin National Park,"I enjoy visiting this park because it is not crowded so you can go at your own pace, there are many things to do, and has two visitor centers with some of the best rangers. Because the park is in a remote part of Nevada with the closest city of any size 60 miles away, you need to plan ahead. There are cave tours (including First Room Tour for those in wheelchairs or others who cannot navigate stairs or narrow passageways) and star gazing parties that fill up, which are seasonal and hours vary so it is wise to make reservations in advance. One of the more unusual things you can do at this park is gather pinyon pine nuts for personal use when they are in season.The VC just north of Baker has an introductory 23 minute video ""Under Great Basin Skies: Life in the Great Basin"" which has beautiful photography from all seasons (it is also for sale in gift shop). Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive (about 25 miles round trip) is the only paved road in the park and climbs over 3400' in elevation past Mather Overlook and Wheeler Peak Overlook to 10,000 feet. There are many hiking trails including wheelchair accessible Island Forest Nature Trail at the end of the scenic drive to strenuous overnight hikes and backpacking. A hike through the bristlecone pine forest at the end of the drive takes you past trees that can live 2000-3000 years in the harshest of conditions. The VC at Lehman Caves handles tickets for the cave tours and also has a small restaurant in the gift shop.

We are not campers; accommodations are limited, though there are a few motels, a couple of good restaurants and the cafe at the park is also good. Make sure you have reservations booked in advance and that businesses and attractions are open, it appears mid-October is the end of the summer season. A longer stay at a warmer time could include some of the longer hikes (the popular bristle cone trail was iced over on our visit) but I highly recommend a shorter stay, too. We are an older middle-aged couple and the scenic drive, stops at the visitors centers, easy hikes and scenic views were perfect for us.

Driving to the end of the park road, there are numerous trails. One heads to Bristlecone Pine Grove, a walk of about 3 hours in total. The trail goes further on towards the glacier.

We were there on a particularly chilly fall day, but the leaves were beautiful in the lower part of the park.

That shows you what a little visited place this is, but having said that, it is a great place to come and spend a few days. There are a few nice campgrounds and several hiking trails. We hiked up to the glacier, through the Bristlecone forest. GB is also famous for it's astronomy. You are at around 9000 feet up and the Milky Way is amazing here!! The rangers give an astronomy talk a few times per week and you can look through a nice telescope.

Great Basin National Park,"Great Basin is a fantastic park with everything from aspen groves, beautiful wildflowers, a very tall, hikeable Peak (Wheeler Peak is 13,006 ft), gorgeous alpine lakes, cool caves, camping, two visitor centers and many trails at all ability levels.My husband and I spent 3 days in Great Basin in early August and it was fabulous! We hiked 35 miles, toured Lehman Cave and checked out both visitor centers. The trails we hiked were: Wheeler Peak, The Alpine Lakes Loop, Bristlecone Pine Trail, Rock Glascier and the Baker/Johnson Lakes Loop Trail. The only complaint I have is in regards to the Johnson/Naker Trail. We mentioned to one ranger and one cashier at the visitor center (on separate occasions) that we were going to hike the loop. We had an in depth discussion with the ranger about which direction we were going to hike the loop. He had hiked it on more than one occasion and agreed we would get a nice view coming down the way we planned on going. Never once did he mention the trail disappears, or that we might need to find our own way down! We had done about 2/3 of the trail and up until that point the trails were very well marked. These are trails that are well traveled and worn quite deeply. That is until you reach the ridge above Johnson Lake and below Pyramid Peak! The trail just disappears at that point! We had taken a photo of the trail at the trail head and also had a copy from one of the trails descriptions given out by the park- but they didn't even show the trail in the same place! The ground is solid quartz and there are no signs or permanent markers of any kind! Given this is in a National Park, and on all the lists of trails in the park, I was shocked! We spent 30-40 minutes scouring the ridge top looking for signs of the trail, markers, anything! We finally decided to just follow the drainage below Pyramid Peak as we knew it would lead us to Baker Creek.We followed the drainage and it picked up a trail of sorts at some points, but that too, disappeared at times. We finally came to what was clearly the main trail and again no markers, trails signs or anything. We went up the trail for a bit as we really wanted to get to Baker Lake, but after about 20 minutes we just headed back down since we knew the restaurant where we wanted to eat in Baker closed at 8:00 and it was already about 6:30.The hike was beautiful, but some of the joy was taken from it by the lack of signage and the frustration we felt since neither park employee bothered to inform us of the lack or signage and trail markers. If planning on taking this hike, please talk to rangers in depth and see if you can get the correct map and or GPS coordinates. The map we purchased because the employee told us it contained GPS coordinates, had no coordinates! Oh and the 13 mile hike became 15 due to the disappearing trail and extra mile hoping to get to Baker Lake!Overall, an awesome park, just one trail that could prove disastrous for unprepared, inexperience hikers!","August 15, 2017",Nevada's hidden Gem!,88,"Virginia City, Nevada",5

It is definitely remote, which is a good portion of the actual charm of the location. There's wide variety of sites to see: from the bristlecone pines, to the Peak, and to the caves. There's something to attract everyone. It is definitely at altitude, so prepare for that. It is so serene, that that feature holds great fascination. On certain evenings in the summer, there are astronomy programs for the public and are well worth the visit. Being an International Dark Sky area, the chances to see the Milky Way and other celestial objects are very high. The docents and rangers set up telescopes for the visitors.

Remote - the park is not crowded as so many of the western National Parks have become. I loved the serenity of the trails beckoning me to take my time to photograph and immerse myself in the beauty of the area.

Great Basin National Park,"We drove three hours through miles of nowhere to reach a park that has no particular significance. Having visited most of the national parks in the lower 48 states, we found this park to be extremely lacking in both its recreational opportunities and accommodations. It consists of little more than a cave and a mountain, with few trails and very little in the way of interesting natural features - Wheeler Peak is no different than any other mountain over 12,000 foot high. Further, we traveled a great distance with plans to have lunch at the supposed ""cafe"", only to find out that it was closed for renovation and due to lack of refrigeration. So, we were three hungry adults and two very hungry children! Finally, aside from a well-made film (though a bit deceptive as it discusses features not actually in the park), the visitor center was probably the worst equipped in terms of information that I have ever seen. The gift shop, meanwhile, was a joke. Don't get me wrong, this park has potential, though at the moment it is NOT worth the drive unless you are attempting to visit ALL of the parks (as we are).

There was still snow and some of the trail was muddy, but the view from the top and the opportunity to spend some time among the majestic Bristlecone Pines was worth it.

Great Basin National Park,"Great Basin National Park is probably the least-known and least-visited park among all in the US, but this does not mean you should miss it! Getting here (as well as leaving here) takes a lot of driving. We took US Hwy 6/50 here and Utah Hwy 21 as we left. Both took us at least 2.5 hours in the open desert/range before we hit the civilization. But the openness of the road, accompanied with surprise encounter of livestock, made the drive both pleasant and interesting. Inside the park, the scenic drive to Wheeler Peak is a must. At the end of a long switchback road, we reached 10000 ft in altitude and were rewarded with breathtaking view of the the snow-topped mountain and bristlecone pines. Unfortunately during our visit (late May 2017), the trails leading to alpine lakes were closed due to extensive snow. We definitely plan on coming back and take the trails on our next visit. Another highlight of the park is Lehman Cave. This is a ""living"" cave that has features and formations that could not be found anywhere else. The cave can only be visited by ranger-led guide tour. Book your tour as early as possible, as each tour can only accommodate less than 20 people. The rangers are very friendly, informative and knowledgeable; they are very happy to answer any questions from the formation of the cave to the flora and fauna in the park.

It was steep and dark (part of the charm for kids, I'm sure) but this made it hard to walk for someone unsteady. The cave was interesting, but not such a ""wow"". That probably comes later in the deeper caves.After about a 20 minute talk by a ranger, they called in another ranger to take us back out while the rest of the group went on.

One of the least visited and most remote, it's worth the travel time to experience this gem. Baker Peak harbors one of the largest Bristlecone Tree forests you'll find. These trees are upwards of 2000 years old, and their twisted and weathered trunks are a testament to their survival in the harsh high altitude. Just a bit of a hike from the Bristlecones, you will find remnants of an ancient glacier. If hiking isn't your thing, then check out the Lehman Cave tours. Rangers will wow you with tall tales from the Old West and stories of how the cave was discovered and explored. Inside, there are very rare shield formations that can't be found in many other caves in North America. As if that wasn't enough, stick around in the evening for the Dark Sky presentations.

The scenic drive to Wheeler Peak was spectacular and the view from the peak shows the vastness of the basin below, You can see the surrounding area for miles. The fall color was at its peak in late October and the groves of golden aspen against the emerald green color of the pines was beautiful. We took lots of pictures. Some of the oldest trees on earth, the Bristlecone pines, are located in this park. You will not be disappointed.","November 6, 2016",Amazing Views,22,"Cape Coral, Florida",5
Great Basin National Park,"WOW. I am so glad we decided to drive to Great Basin. It's halfway between Salt Lake and Yosemite, and it was the perfect stop. There are 4 campgrounds inside the park, and all were very pretty. We stayed at Baker Creek Campground, and LOVED IT! The vault toilets are very clean and there is a creek trail starting at the campground. They are all first come first serve. Wheeler Peak Campground was beautiful and filled with Aspen trees, but much cooler due to elevation. This is a very laid back park. It was very slow when I visited, even during their Astronomy Festival. They offer cave tours which you shouldn't miss.","October 30, 2016",Unbelievable Vistas and Night Skies,34,"La Quinta, California",4

Great Basin National Park,"When we arrived, early morning, the visitor center was not open...it is not even on the road to the park.....somewhat unusual for a National Park.The next visitor center that we came upon was for the cave tours. We did schedule a cave tour and watched a film in the center.We then drove to Wheeler Peak, about a 30 minute drive on narrow, curvy roads.Upon arrival we discovered that we had another 2 miles, on foot, to get high enough to see the bristlecone pine groves. The path through the woods was not clearly marked, but we did not get lost (at times I was worried). This is an uphill hike !!!!The effort is worth it when you get up to the top of the mountain and see the bristlecone trees.....they are one of a kind.The great basin is interesting.......none of the water in the great basin area flows into a stream or river that flows into an ocean......all of the water soaks into the ground, goes into lakes or evaporates.Be aware that this park is located in a VERY remote area.....plan well in advance to go there and make your hotel, etc. reservations.And.............it is a beautiful park !!!!!","October 23, 2016",A different experience,336,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Great Basin National Park,"We have now visited about a dozen National Parks and it was honestly the Great Basin National Park seemed a disappointment and misnomer. At the onset, I’ll say we aren’t hikers, and this place may be a hiker’s dream, but we cannot confirm that. The vistas along the 30 minute drive to Wheeler’s Peak were impressive. We drove all the way across Utah to visit the park and discovered the park management focusing mainly on the Lehman Caves Tours and not the main park. We arrived early in the day and were told we couldn’t join a tour for about four hours or more. There were perhaps only 20 people in the visitor center where a cave tour was about to leave. It was a strange place that could hardly hold a candle to its sister parks around the country.","October 17, 2016","Impressive, but confusing",18,,3

The Great Basin covers an enormous expanse of the west and it is extremely interesting to learn about it. The film at the visitors is new and very well done. There are a limited number of hikes but all are interesting. The main attraction are the 4,000 year old bristle cone pines. The trail is relatively easy, but at 11,000 feet some people may have a problem. Lehman cave is wonderful. Take the longer tour is you have time. Make reservations in advance for weekends.

Great Basin National Park,"I specifically went to Great Basin National Park to photograph the milky way during the new moon at the first of August 2016. Great Basin is a gold tier international dark sky park, meaning there is very little light pollution and on a clear night you can see upwards of 30,000 stars with the naked eye, and in the summer months has some phenomenal views of the core of the milky way galaxy. This was only a quick trip for me, only 2 nights but I will be back for sure next summer. If you plan on going stay in Ely, Nevada which while is an hour drive from the park has much better hotels and more restaurants than Baker, Nevada which is 10 minutes from the park. I had looked into staying in Baker, but the few hotels they had looked really sketchy and had terrible reviews. The other great thing about Great Basin is that it's pretty quiet, they don't get even close to the amount of visitors like Arches/Canyonland/Capital Reef does even in the peak of summer.","September 11, 2016",Stargazing Galore!,3,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

We took the Wheeler Scenic Drive as we only had a few hours here and the views from 10,000 ft were terrific and the Autumn colours were so nice to see. You do need to book on a tour for the Lehman Caves so the earlier you can get there the better chance of getting on them (we were there at 11am and there were free places on the 2pm one). And as is customary at National Parks the ranger was friendl, helpful and extremely knowledgeable.

Great Basin National Park,"Lehman Caves: we did the 90-minute tour through the caverns. Very interesting and the ranger was informative. Its pretty level and in many cases you have to duck to avoid bumping your head. Narrow in some places. Its as much a monument to nature's magnificence as it is to man's arrogance and stupidity. When first discovered at the turn of the 20th century, it was a speak-easy, a secluded party venue, and those of that time broke off centuries old stalagmites for fun, and profit. They are forgotten, their money spent and their stupidity remains for all the world to see. We hiked the bristlecone pine trail which begins at 10,000 feet and ascends another 600 feet. Beautiful forest and trail leads to a bristlecone pine grove. Very interesting, almost spiritual. Breathtaking views from high altitude.  The park is remote and few facilities, but bring a picnic and enjoy the hikes. The ""dark sky"" evenings reveal the milky way and billions of stars on a clear night.

Great Basin National Park,"We love National Parks and are planning to see as many as we can over the coming years (48 on this trip alone!), and while they each stand on their own qualities, this wasn't exactly my favorite. It was beautiful of course and the cave tour was interesting. However, if you've been up one peak you can sort of feel like you've been up many. This is the feeling I got. Again though, this park has its own qualities that many would probably be enamored with, and you may as well. I will say this though, if you have limited time or options and are not as obsessed with NPS as us, this park is out of the way and therefore time consuming. Just consider that when planning a summer vacation. On the flip of that coin is the fact that we felt like we were alone the entire time which is a true luxury in National Parks sometimes. Lastly, though I sound somewhat dour on Great Basin, one additional benefit is the drive in and out. We are going west to California. The drive across Utah and then all the way across Nevada was breathtaking. We wouldn't have ever seen all that isolated natural wonder had it not been for Great Basin calling us into that part of the country.Okay, so I guess I am saying go after all, aren't I? It's what you make of the visit!","August 28, 2016",Nice visit,70,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4
Great Basin National Park,"This park is an unexpected green gem that stands out like an island in the dry desert of eastern Nevada.After a stop at either of the nice visitors centers, chart a course up the aptly named Scenic Drive. At the end of the road begins a wonderful trail that winds its way through the rugged glacial scree to a magnificent grove of Bristlecone Pine trees. These trees are as old as 3,000 to 5,000 years. (Actually there are young ones too). They are so durable that even after they finally die, many may remain standing for centuries before falling. Interpretative signs help appreciate how remarkable these trees really are.

While eating our lunch at 10,000 ft., my husband decided he wants to train to climb Wheeler Peak which is 13,000+ ft. The view looking down to the valley from the top of the drive is truly spectacular!!! While at the park, be sure to take a tour of Lehman Cave.

Great Basin National Park,"My family travels up to northeastern Utah every year, and on the way we like to visit the various national parks and take in the incredible scenery of America's great Southwest.Previous journeys have taken us to Zion and Bryce Canyons, but this year we decided to take a different route and visit Great Basin National Park. Instead of staying on Interstate 15, we turned off the freeway just past Las Vegas and ventured north on Highway 93 - also known as the Great Basin Highway.It was a pleasant drive along a lightly traveled two-lane road. We caught the sunrise at lower Pahranagat Lake, then passed through the small towns of Alamo and Caliente. At certain points, we appeared to be all alone along a thin ribbon of asphalt, surrounded by vast stretches of wilderness. We wouldn't see another car for 20 minutes to half an hour at a time. In total, it was a nine-hour drive from San Diego, and we ended up in Baker about 10 a.m.There wasn't much there. In fact, I wouldn't encourage anyone to spend much time outside the gates of the park. Even the park headquarters themselves were rather sparse and spartan. There was a bare bones cafe, with very friendly service, but for a national park, it left much to be desired.No matter though, we weren't there for the cafe or the gift shop. After grabbing a bite to eat and purchasing a few souvenirs, we headed up to the top of Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive. Just a note to those coming from Sea Level: when we exited our vehicle for a hike to Stella Lake, we were above 10,000 feet elevation. So expect to fight a little for oxygen into your lungs, and be sure to bring at least a long-sleeve shirt, if not a windbreaker or sweater.I'm sad to report that I saw a lot of carvings in the surrounding stands of Aspen trees, a sad commentary on the collective consciousness of the visitors. Why do people feel the need to mark up nature with their initials and crude comments? Anyway...Our goal was also to visit a grove of Bristlecone Pines - some of the oldest living things in the world. We spent three hours exploring the beauty and natural wonders of Mt. Wheeler, before descending from the park and driving an hour to our hotel room in Ely, Nevada. On the way back toward the fork in the road at Majors Place, we saw a rain squall near Swamp Cedar Natural Area. The Great Basin experience took us to a very remote area of Nevada, but we were rewarded with some great sights and that invaluable feeling of truly getting away from it all.","August 23, 2016",A Remote Oasis in the Midst of the Nevada Desert,11,"La Jolla, California",4

The same ranger who conducted the afternoon astronomy program conducted the ""night sky"" meteor watch. Both programs were excellent. There was a telescope directed at Saturn, the moon and other celestial bodies. The ranger pointed out the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, satellites and constellations. We toured the cave last year and our plan was to camp at Wheeler Peak and hike to the alpine lakes and Bristlecone Pines.

Great Basin National Park,"Even if you're just tent-camping for the night, even if you're hot and sweaty and road-addled from the last long westward stretch of Highway 50, where it seemed you'd never get to the other side of that ridiculous basin, even if it's all you can do to drag yourself the extra six miles from the Visitor's Center up to your campsite, this is the place to throw your tent down onto the gravel and fall over into it. Especially on a cool, windy night in July. Perfect.We had reserved a spot in the Grey Cliffs campground (watch for the sign, easy to miss)—C loop, site #3, partly shaded (piñon and juniper, mostly), two sturdy tables with benches, a grill and a fire pit, easily backed-into for an SUV. It's a short walk up to the pit toilet, which is one of those that does a good enough job of decomposition that you really don't smell it much, even when you're in it.We arrived on a Thursday and I saw that they have an astronomy night at the Lehman Caves Visitors Center at 8:30 p.m. The timing was good, so we drove up to sit under the stars and learn something new about them—but WE COULD NOT FIND THE LEHMAN CAVES VISITORS CENTER. The map made it very clear where it should be. But there's not a single sign along the road, or at the parking lot near the trailhead at the end of that road, to suggest that a visitors center is anywhere in the vicinity. We drove back down to make sure we hadn't missed a turnoff, and drove back up again, looking for any sign of anything astronomical or visitors center-y, but to no avail. So we just went back to our campsite and watched the light show from there. The stars are astounding. I'd heard that this park is the best place to see the Milky Way in the continental U.S., but honestly, I've seen it better from Big Sur and elsewhere. The lower constellations near the horizon, though, made me realize how seldom I've seen them at all. Beautiful!After cooking and eating, we drove back down to the park Visitors Center, which was right where we left it, and washed up in the bathroom there. It's clean, well-lit, and there are drinking fountains if you're running short on water. It's right outside the front door to the center itself, so it's always open.We heard a few critters snuffling around our tent during the night, but I didn't see any faces peering into the windows, which on our tent are about a foot off the ground, so the animals must have been marmots, jackrabbits, and other low-slung denizens of the high desert. You can hear Baker Creek, faintly, from loop C of Grey Cliffs (and you can see the cliffs, right there in your face), but there are other campsites right on the creek, which might be very nice. They were booked when I called.The Nat Parks guy on the phone told me that at Great Basin you have to reserve sites for two nights. It's $12/night, so not a huge deal, but I don't get that. Unless you want to spend a day at the caves (we didn't), this is a great spot to get off of the Loneliest Road in America for one night, and then get right back on it as you aim for that distant horizon and get the hell out of Nevada.","July 10, 2016",Perfect Stop on the Loneliest Road in America,7,"Overland Park, Kansas",4

Great Basin National Park,I enjoyed this out of the way park. The guided tour of Lehman cave was awesome. I have toured many caves throughout the USA and this one had some features I have not seen before. Over 300 cave shield formations. Our tour guide Danny was great and gave us so much information in the 90 minute tour. They do have a 1 hour tour but I would opt for the long one. The walk is pretty short but there are some stairs and rails. The price is reasonable at 10.00 for adults. I wore long sleeves and a jacket which was enough for the 50 degrees while walking. Also in the park we took the 12 mile drive to Wheeler point and walked the 1.2 miles to Stella lake. It was well worth the hike and beautiful to see. From there you can hike another 3 miles to the summit if you so choose. There are a number of other hikes in the park as well. We camped in Baker (6 miles from the park) at Whispering Elms RV.

Great Basin National Park,"After being many times in Nevada, this year we really wanted to visit the remote Great Basin National Park. From Reno we took the highway 50, the Loniest Road in the World, straight to Great Basin (387 miles!). Best to stay over at Ely or smaller Baker. The park is no more or less the largest mountain in the Nevada desert, Wheeler Peak (more than 13000 feet high). It is nice to drive the one way loop and experience the different climate zones, but it won't bring you high enough to see the old bristlecone pines (thousands of years old) or the snowy peak. The scenic drive stops at a little more than 10.000 feet. For that you have to walk some of the longer trails (such as the Bristlecone trail and especially the long Wheeler Peak Summit trail) and be really prepared to take plenty of time such as a full day and wear mountain shoes because of the slippery and snowy conditions of the trails. We couldn't do that, next time! We did the short Mountain View Nature Trail. The campgrounds are very nice too, probably the best way to enjoy the park. Many people especially come for the Leyman Caves. You have to buy tickets for that. This national park maybe is not as great as others, but still worth a visit.","July 4, 2016",Largest mountain in Nevada worth a visit,132,"Rijswijk, The Netherlands",4

Pinyon and juniper are the predominate trees, and a nice grove of Bristlecone pines. Baker creek is a lovely, moderately strenuous hike, taking you to dense forests and springs, even a lake if you walk far enough.

Secondly, by taking this detour we were able to reach Wells, Nevada and skip all of the fast and furious traffic going through Salt Lake City and the numbing trip along the Great Salt Lake (we've been along Interstate 80 many times). We did not explore the caves on the premises, but we enjoyed the views from the visitors' center on the hill. There is another visitors' center just north of town.

Lots of talking, not a lot of cave viewing. Take the longer tour. Bring a flashlight & a jacket if you get cold at 50 degrees. If you get claustrophobia, close your eyes in the opening tunnel after they shut the outside door, before they open the door to the cave.

Great Basin National Park,"After having a desire to visit Great Basin National Park ever since it was created, this past Summer we visited it twice from Las Vegas. The first time we spent three nights in adjacent Hidden Canyon Ranch which was a great place to stay down a dirt road from Garrison, Utah. Really nice people running the place as well as the guest who had also traveled extensively. Turkeys and deer roamed about. Our next visit a month later was on a trip around Nevada with my son and his wife, and we spent the night in Ely after a quick visit to the park. The town of Baker is very small and has a few amenities, but Ely less than an hour's drive to the west is the largest town (4000?) that is close.The national park was created around the former Lehman Caves National Monument. At the entrance to the caves besides the ticket office and displays, there is also a restaurant that serves huckleberry ice cream which we loved. Having explored many caves and been in other commercial caves, I didn't think that they were that great but interesting enough. The other major attraction of the park is the drive up over 13,000 ft tall Wheeler peak, Nevada's second highest mountain. You can drive up to 10,000 ft where there is a lovely campground with deer and turkeys. On our first visit over the 4th of July holiday all campsites were taken, but a month later on a Sunday afternoon only about four were taken. I would like to return and camp there. During the Summer the park was subject to afternoon thundershowers limiting hiking up the peak to a morning activity.Although the night skies are touted, forget it during the Summer, remember those afternoon thundershowers and clouds, they don't magically disappear when it gets dark. And if this is a reason to visit the park, you might also like to visit at a time other than a full moon.I really enjoyed this park for its remoteness and the lack of visitors which for me spoils visits to many other national parks. On our next trip I will use a 4-wheel drive so that the large arch down a dirt road in the south part of the park can be visited as well as the many nearby ghost towns down other dirt roads.","September 29, 2015",About as remote as it gets now,96,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Great Basin National Park,"...and ""trek"" it is, because Great Basin National Park isn't easy to get to. My son & I drove up U.S. 93 from Las Vegas - a long, though scenic, drive, with some interesting towns along the way. We stayed in Ely, NV as our ""base"" for seeing Great Basin NP.The two main attractions at GBNP are Mount Wheeler (highest peak in NV) and Lehman Caves. Time prevented us from going into the caves - also, I've been to Carlsbad, Howe, Luray and several others - but I was able to walk part of the Mount Wheeler trail that leads to the peak.The trail is wonderful and a refreshing change from the arid Great Basin. The altitude is quite high, so breathing can be a challenge for some (it was for me).As nice as this place is, I couldn't help but wonder if GBNP was created just to give Nevada its own National Park. Until it was created, it was ""merely"" Lehman Caves National Monument, and that aside, I believe that the only other NPS facility in Nevada is Lake Mead National Recreation Area (and a relatively small corner of Death Valley National Park).So, per the title of this review - GBNP is not the Major Leagues with Yellowstone, Zion, Grand Canyon and others - but it is certainly a refreshing change from the deserts and basins of this region - if you're in the neighborhood.","September 29, 2015","Not a Yellowstone, Zion or Grand Canyon caliber park, but worth the trek...",45,"The Villages, Florida",4

Great Basin National Park,"After driving the ""loneliest highway"" for hours between Virginia City and Ely, we were delighted to find a pristine, uncrowded park with 3 major attractions (for us). The Fall foliage has started already; the aspens are yellow to orange and splashed over the mountainsides. Lehman Caves was a major pleasant surprise; the 90-minute guided tour was informative and entertaining. Beware - we needed to reserve a tour 1 day ahead; they were selling out. The hiking trails were well-marked, easy, moderate, and strenuous. We climbed to the bristlecone pine grove (moderate - but elevation 10,500 ft). Temps drop sharply as you climb; it was 80F in Baker and 58F @ the bristlecone grove (3000 yr-old trees!).A caution - Baker is tiny; accommodations are scarce - many park visitors are campground oriented. I'd estimate there are 32 or so bookable motel rooms in the town. There is no park lodge.The flip side of the scarce accommodations is - you feel like you have the park almost to yourself.The dark skies/stargazing attraction is legit; however we were there on two relatively cloudy days. Nonetheless, at 11pm on a scattered, cloudy night, we easily saw the milky way and its depth.Last comments - seasonality - friends visited this past spring (lots of wildlife; marmots everywhere). We saw coyote, jackrabbit, 1 pronghorn, chipmunks & squirrels, and white-headed nutcrackers. The Baker community apparently shuts down soon after Labor Day and the Park may be less staffed after October.","September 15, 2015","Remote, beautiful, unique - but very seasonal.",20,MARTINSVILLE,4
Great Basin National Park,"We visited for the Annual Astronomy Festival this past weekend. Great Basin has wonderfully dark skies due to it's remote location away from any city and high altitude. The landscape ranges from open scrubland to alpine Aspen and Pine tree groves. It's gorgeous in the fall with the turning color. The weather can vary a lot during the day- it can be really hot even in September then get incredibly cold in the higher elevations. If you plan to come for the weekend, arrive early and make sure to set up camp before you do anything else. There are no reservations for any of the campgrounds in this park. There is also no entrance fee to the park itself. There are only around 100 spots dispersed across 5 different campgrounds (one which is called Grey Cliffs and isn't even listed in the official NPS website) the spots fill up quickly and alternative sites for tent campers outside the park are unsafe and noisy or too far away.Both visitor centers close at 5pm and there is very little information (and very spotty cell phone service). Most of the Ranger staff in this park is unmotivated and under informed. Repeated calls to the main visitor center went unanswered or the staff member who picked up the phone simply did not know the answers to even the most basic campground questions. Postings outside of the park are out-dated and will not help you if you arrive after 7pm as we did.If you plan your trip and arrive within work hours you will be well rewarded. The cafe next to the Lehman Caves Visitor Center serves the best prepared and priced food in the area but closes at 4:30pm.This is a great place to explore if you plan your arrival well. Arriving late is a huge gamble and I recommend against it.","September 14, 2015",Beautiful park in the middle of nowhere,29,,4

Great Basin National Park,"This National Park has been on my list for awhile now and I'm so glad we finally had the chance to visit! And now, after the first visit, we can't wait to go back! We camped at Baker Creek Campground - there are 4 campgrounds at GBNP and Baker Creek's sites are farthest apart, though they are still pretty cozy compared to other places we've camped. There are a lot of trees - river birch, pines, etc. and a small flowing creek that runs through this campground. We stayed at site #14 which is a little walk from the bathroom (vault toilets only) and water pump, but is very quiet and along the creek. I wish there was a place to review the campground, but there isn't . . . The park has a number of hiking trails of varying difficulty. We had a group of 8 with children ranging in age from 7-12 so we opted for the Stella Lake trail which isn't strenuous or long, but lands you at a beautiful lake! Highly recommend! There are two Visitor Centers at GBNP, the one near Baker Creek CG has a small cafe and gift shop in addition to the Visitors Center and is also the spot for buying Lehman Caves tickets and where the tour starts. Highly recommend the tour by the way (different review). We stopped here numerous times a day and had ice cream, bought ice, went on the cave tour, turned in our Jr. Ranger book and attended the Ranger's Astronomy Program! That was super cool!You probably know . . . GBNP is one of the world's best sites for astronomy lovers -- the skies are so very clear and the stars and planets are very viewable, even to the naked eye. The ranger pointed out that its one of the only spots in which you can view 6 of the 8 planets and he pointed out Saturn with his super laser pointer!! Super fun stuff.

Bristlecone Pine forest about 1.5 miles from lot, nice trail , saw lots of seniors and grade schoolers handling it just fine. Bristle cones are just at timber line. Park Ranger tells us many are 3,000 to 5,000 years old and one measured 10,000. If you have seen Redwoods and Sequoia's add these to your list.

We were able to get surprisingly close to deer, wild turkeys and coyotes. There are hiking trails that can go from 10,000 to 13,000 feet in elevation. Leman caves is well worth the time for the longer tour. The cave contains rare shield and bulbous stalactite formations. Sky viewing, when not cloudy is superb. It clouded up each evening of our visit, however, my wife got a spectacular view of the Milky Way through a hole in the clouds. The park has ranger staff that specialize in astronomy. Nights are truly dark without light pollution.","August 17, 2015",A surprisingly beautiful place in Nevada.,23,"Dixon, California",4
Great Basin National Park,"We spent the day at the park and realized that one day is not enough. We went to both Visitor Centers, Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, the 90 minute Lehman Cave Tour and the short Mountain View Nature Trail. The scenic drive up the winding mountain road ends at the Wheeler Peak campground. The sites are very nice, most in shade, some in full sun and several bordering the meadow. The trailheads to Bristlecone trail and Glacier are here. With the exception of the nature trail the hikes are longer than 2.8 miles round trip and at high elevations. The cave tour directed by a ranger is a MUST DO. This cave has an interesting history and has many, many formations, several that are quite rare. If you take the tour make sure to also do the nature trail since one of the stops is the original vertical entrance to the cave. When we return to Great Basin we will camp for 2-3 days at Wheeler Peak, take several of the hikes and enjoy the night sky.","August 16, 2015",MORE THAN A ONE DAY PARK!,245,"Fair Oaks, California",5

We walked a short trail around a pretty meadow with aspens and a small creek running through it. We also saw a turkey.

The view of Wheeler Peak is beautiful; the serenity of Tesera Lake breathtaking, Lehman Caves fascinating, and the refreshing beauty of Baker Creek rejuvenating. And that dark-night sky!!!

We traveled in a northwest direction from Cedar City UT on route 21, then highway 6/50 to Carson City, NV. You will pass by 2 national monument visitor centers; both are free & very worthwhile.

Second, the Bristlecone Pine grove is wonderful - 3,000 year old trees, great interpretive signs; my wife nailed it when she said it felt like walking through hallowed ground. The trees are absolutely unique. It's a heck of a long way from anywhere but there isn't anything quite like it and we have been to almost all the other western national parks.

The astronomy program was cool but with tired kids we were disappointed that it was half hour wait to look in the telescopes since there are only 2 to look through. We couldn't wait that long, but it may have been an unusually large group that night. We did everything we wanted to in one day, so too bad it is so far out of the way.

I can't think of a better experience! Of course, everything is what you make of it but our trip was simply magical. There are campgrounds, amenities, trails, tours, scenic views, etc. for basically every level of comfort. We enjoyed primitive camping at the Strawberry Creek campgrounds. The tour of Lehman cave is a must, and the hiking is different on every single trail which is brilliant and keeps it interesting. During our four day adventure, we had enough time to enjoy the South Fork Baker and Timber trails, the Wheeler Peak scenic drive, and fishing at Cleave Creek. Additionally, the visitor centers provide the best, most informative programs and tours of anywhere I've ever been. We especially enjoyed the astronomy program at the Lehman visitors center even though we got rained out.

Great Basin National Park,"Getting there:Getting to the park is a journey unto itself. It is about 3.5 hours from St George, UT, for example (a popular jumping off place for Bryce and Zion), about 4.5 hours from either Las Vegas or Salt Lake City, or about 6 hours from the east entrance to Yosemite. The drive across the high plains is interesting -- with the dry climate, one can see for miles. We crossed valleys where the road was straight for 30 miles -- down one side and up to the next pass. We passed about a car or 2 on average every 20 minutes or so.Attractions:Drive a mostly straight road directly from tiny Baker, NV at 5,300 feet up to the Visitor Center at 6,000 feet. There is (as of June 2015) no fee to get in.Drive the winding 12-mile road to the end at 9,000 feet. The views are amazing because the peak stands virtually by itself. Definitely hike the trails possibly to the top of Wheeler Peak at 13,000 feet (very strenuous), or the more recommended couple of modest 3-5 mile trails around a couple of beautiful small lakes, or up to 3,500-year old bristle cone pines. (The trails could be combined by any sort of half-experienced hiker). The bristle cone pines are truly amazing. We didn't find the lakes/bristle-cone trails too challenging, but be aware that one is at 9,000 feet where the air is not like back home on the coast. It will also be much cooler than the Visitor Center. The weather was a sunny and pleasant 75-80 degrees on the lake/bristle-cone trails. There are other trails in the park at lower elevations, but it was bit too warm for us in late June.Lehman Caves is the other big attraction. We took the longer 1½-hour tour and had no difficulties. There is a modest fee for the tour. This tour is different than many other cave tours because the walkways are so narrow, and only 20 people go in each group. You will need reservations -- Although we reserved a month early I believe that probably only 1-3 days ahead of time would be required. Accommodations""As this is about 40 miles from East No-Where, there ain't a lot of places to stay"". The campgrounds were all full each night. There are limited choices for the non-camper. We stayed at Hidden Canyon Ranch -- a nice place at the end of 6 miles of gravel road. It comes with a hearty breakfast at the time that you want to get up, and we paid extra for dinner because, as I said, there ain't a lot of choices. You can see my and other's review of Hidden Canyon Ranch.There is a cafe at the Visitor's Center.","July 16, 2015","Out-of-the-Way, But Worth It",8,,5
Great Basin National Park,"This is a wonderful little park with great alpine views everywhere of the tallest mountain, named Wheeler Peak. A good road takes you right up to above 10,000 feet to the upper campground and trail access area. Its off the beaten path so it wasn't crowded even in mid summer. The views are stupendous. If you don't hike, there's still plenty to see, and if you do there's trails for every level, including the summit hike to Wheeler Peak which is only 4 miles with a 3,000 foot gain. If that's too severe a hike, you can walk out to the first alpine lake in just under a mile, or just putter around the short trails around the upper parking lot and enjoy views of Wheeler from every trail. The drive up has beautiful views of Wheeler Peak as well as the mountains to the north and the desert floor below to the east. The Lehman Caves Visitor Center lower down has plenty of places to just sit and enjoy the view as well as great views of the vistas to the east to Utah. It also has a nice little cafe where we ate lunch. We plan to go back in the fall when the aspens are in color.","July 13, 2015",Fantastic Jewel of a National Park,7,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

Great Basin National Park,"There were also parking areas for those interested in walking the trails. We did not choose to walk any trails, but I suspect more specular views would reward the hikers. The top of the mountain was encircled with tall trees, so there were no outstanding views. The Rangers provided scheduled talks each day. And there were evening (under the stars) presentations. At the higher altitude, the temperature dropped, so take some extra clothing (sweatshirt, windbreaker, etc) depending upon the season of your visit.","July 11, 2015","The drive up the mountain was a ""cork screw"" paved two lane road.

Great Basin National Park,"The negative things others are saying about this park is exactly what I like about it. It is very remote, and rugged, and the only thing to really do is hike. If you want to hike for a few days in remote natural beauty, this is a great park. It is 5 hours from Vegas, and probably 10+ hours from any other big city. The Wheeler campground at 10,000 feet will be nice and cool even in the summer when it is 100 degrees on the valley floor. Please use caution if hiking with kids, I saw a mountain lion on a trail, no more than 15 yards ahead of me. When hiking stay in groups and make noise. I climbing to the top of Wheeler Peak and the views are stunning. So is the hike where you see the remnants of the glacier.

Great Basin National Park,"This park is not like the other N.P.'s we've been to. We took a cave tour and walked the Alpine Lakes loop and Bristlecone trail. I reviewed those items separately. For the Wheeler Peak Drive: There are only a couple of signed pulloffs, and those didn't have signage to describe what was in view. Few pulloffs of any kind, as a matter of fact, and you don't drive up to the peak, either. I wish the park service would spend a little more on this park even though it's not as pretty or interesting as some of the others. Much of it is scrubby, high desert flora, and not nearly as much heavily forested slopes of fir, spruce, and aspen that other high altitude parks feature. Maybe it's a casualty of the presentation and location. Still, we like to see the parks and we're not sorry we spent the three days it took to see it, starting from Salt Lake City. A bonus was stopping at the Bonneville Salt Flats for a few minutes in Wendover, Utah.","July 7, 2015",Not spectacular.,116,TN,3

Because this park is off the beaten path, it is nowhere near as crowded as others, but still offers beautiful hikes and a fantastic cave tour.If hiking: Bring rain gear and be prepared to come off the hill if a storm hits. Hiking early in the day reduces the chance of being caught in one of these storms. I did the lake loop trail in a little over an hour, got some beautiful views for the summit.If caving: Reserve your tickets early. I was lucky as a solo traveler and got the last ""day of"" ticket when I checked in at 10am. So best to reserve well before you come to the park. Bring a flashlight of your own for maximum viewing.Note: The park is free, but the caves have a small fee.The ""town"" of Baker isn't a town. It's got a self-serve set of gas pumps, a couple of diners, and a motel. So consider this when thinking about food, gas, and provisions.

Not that they don't do a good job with the cave tour...but it looks like any other cave you might see. If you have kids, perhaps a good idea. I did complete a nice day hike on one of the loop trails.

Great Basin National Park,"My sister and I visited Great Basin National Park in September 2014. It was our first time there, and I didn't know much about the park before arriving. But I was surprised how beautiful it was. The location is rather remote; it's not near any interstates or large cities, so you have to drive a lot of miles on some lonely desert highways to get there, but it is well worth it (especially if you like ""getting away from it all""). Keep your gas tank full, and bring lots of provisions (or be prepared to ""rough it"" a bit). There isn't much in the way of ""services"" nearby. But one of the things I loved about this park is the fact that it's not heavily visited, so it's quiet and peaceful. Forested mountains rise up from the surrounding desert floor, and the air smells of pine. The views are beautiful, the campground is really nice, and there are good hiking trails. You can either hike or take the scenic drive up to the summit of Wheeler Peak (13,063 feet). The stargazing at night is incredible, thanks to the lack of light pollution in the area.

It is rather away from most habitation and I think that it is a saving grace. The rangers were informative and friendly. The ranger that led the Lehman Cave Tour was funny and very informative. Sarah, our guide, answered any and all questions with humor and intelligence. That is a great combination. The entire park is, simply stated, beautiful. There are beautiful pines and aspens and if you can hike in far enough, the Bristle Cones, some as old as 5,000 years. It just boggles the mind they are the oldest living things on Earth.There are many trails to take you almost wherever you are capable of hiking. We took a short easy trail that led us to streams and great views of Wheeler Peak. Even in the drought we are in there were still some small patches of snow. Thankfully there are those that think places like Great Basin need to be preserved for us and those who follow.Watch the film before heading out it is very enlightening.The cave tours fill up so make a reservation ahead of time. Friends had given us a heads up and we made reservations, luckily too because all of the tours were sold out that day.

Great Basin National Park,"Great Basin NP is one of our favorite places to hike. With fewer visitors than other national parks, most of whom are there to tour the Lehman Caves, the hiking trails are quiet, giving us a chance to spot birds and wildlife (this trip we came upon a lizard couple sunning on a rock -- they didn't budge until we were almost on top of them, they were so relaxed or asleep and unaware of us humans). The access road to the Lexington Arch Trail had washed out since our last visit here three years ago, adding about another mile to the hike just to get to the original trailhead.

Great Basin National Park,"Enjoyed and appreciated:▪️Several good educational introductory videos to the park at the Lehman Visitor Center. ▪️Lehman Cave guided tour well worth the nominal fee. Small 20-person tour size works. We are not ""cavers"" yet enjoyed the picturesque large, small and intricate formations. ▪️Fun hike up South Fork of Baker Creek. Moderate difficulty. ▪️Wheeler Peak and surrounding high mountains and their snowy caps are highly photogenic. You can see the weather changing around the peaks. ▪️High mountain bubbling brooks.▪️Friendly, inquisitive, begging marmots. ▪️Wild turkeys, which were introduced in the valleys for hunting purposes and quickly relocated to the mountainsides. Ranger said that non-native ""mountain"" wild turkeys were mistakenly released and are now protected. Below is my slight issue:Road to Wheeler Peak trails closed at Mather Overlook the first two of our three days at Great Basin, (Memorial Day Sunday and Monday) due to ""too much ice and snow on the road"" per a ranger. OK, I get that. But, the road was open Tuesday morning first thing and there was zero ice, snow or runoff snow melt moisture on the road then, which I found highly unlikely if there was ice or snow the day before.

We stayed the night in Beaver, Utah and got up early and headed out. It is 122 miles from Beaver, Utah to Baker, Nevada. The road is great and it is a pretty drive. It took us about two hours to get there. We went to the Lehman Caves Viisitor Center instead of the one in Baker. We visited in May and we were only able to drive half of the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive. What we saw was absolutely beautiful. After the drive we went on the Grand Palace Tour in Lehman Caves. The Lehman Cave tours are Ranger guided and a must do!!!!! We also walked the nature trail behind the visitor center.

Great Basin National Park,"We visited Great Basin National Park later that day. This is not very well visited because of its remote location. Lehman Caves is one of their attractions. This was a cave that first saw cave tours about 100 years ago, well before the park existed. Lehman, the man giving the cave tours did not own them, however. Even then they were part of the US Forestry Services Land. However, he had a motto “if you break it you can take it.” Needless to say the cave is very damaged, even has graffiti. The cave also has very little color, rather looks like the color of concrete unless ultra violet light is shown on it, when the minerals show fluoresce. The Park was partly closed when we were there because of snow at higher elevations so we were not able to see the Bristle Cone Pines that grow above 10,000 feet elevation.","April 16, 2015","IT YOU ARE NEAR IT, DO STOP.",128,Ohio,4

We felt like we went to school and didn't have to pay for it.Check out the only glacier in Nevada. It's mostly for bragging rights, It's an arduous hike over scree and talus.

Great Basin National Park,"Was taking a very short trip to the Western United States, and had never been to Great Basin National Park. I focus much of my travel to places where I can see birds, and the dramatic elevation change on the Mt Wheeler scenic drive was very appealing to me. Knowing that the environment changes with elevation (trees, mammals, birds), it looked like a good place go, though it is very remote.The visitor center in Baker was very helpful in providing me with information about the park, and specifically birding information. Where different types of birds could be expected to be seen. Very helpful.Mt Wheeler is truly a spectacular mountain with the only glaciers in Nevada. Some of the pull off spots along the road presented great photo opportunitiesTook the scenic drive (to over 10,000 feet) very slowly, and stopped frequently wherever it seemed safe. One highlight was seeing a Golden Eagle take flight about 100 feet away. And I saw one bird that I'd never seen before.My only disappointment was not being able to hike on the trails to the Bristlecone pine forest, and another area where a very difficult bird to see (Black Rosy-Finch) is relatively dependable.There is a handicapped trail at the 10,000 ft elevation campground which was nice, and I walked the entire distance, stopping to sit several times, but I saw no birds. Did see a deer quite close.A thunderstorm started to drop rain at the highest elevation, which prompted me to leave. Drove slowly down the scenic road and did not encounter any rain. But when getting to the bottom of this road, near the park entrance, the storm continued high on the mountain. After driving hundreds of miles across some very dry terrain to reach GBNP, this place was a special treat, and quite unexpected.","August 22, 2014",Wish I had more time,119,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

The campgrounds range from a natural experience at the Lehman campgrounds to more man-made one at the highest Wheeler campground, but all have great settings.

Great Basin National Park,"My husband and I were traveling across Nevada on Hwy 50 and decided to take the 5-mile detour to Great Basin National Park; we were delighted that we did. We were greeted with unexpected grandeur that rises up in stark contrast to the surrounding flatlands. Our first stop was at the cozy visitors’ center just north of the park entrance, where we were greeted by a friendly and helpful ranger. A nice characteristic of Great Basin National Park is that you’re able to drive to all the viewpoints at Lehman Caves and up Mt Wheeler. We opted to take the Mt Wheeler Scenic drive, and were greeted with breathtaking scenery. It’s a 45-minute drive along a winding road to the highest spot accessible by vehicle (at 11,000 feet); there are three major turnouts (the lowest one is unpaved) accessible from either direction of travel that allow excellent viewpoints to take photographs of the lesser peaks and valleys below as well as Mt Wheeler itself. The hardy hiker is afforded several trailheads at the highest point of the drive to ascend to the summit (13,000 feet).NOTE 1: as cautioned by the ranger, it is dangerous and unadvised to take a RV or similar vehicle up the scenic drive. NOTE 2: We visited during the summer; we saw many cautionary signs and road closure gates which signified that the savvy traveler must plan ahead in the winter months.Entrance to Great Basin National Park is free and available all year round, weather permitting.

Border Inn a few miles away actually has a better market but prices are high there as well. If you want a burger, ice cream or sandwich go to the Lehman Caves visitor center gift shop and snack bar.

Great Basin National Park,"This park is small compared to places like Canyonlands, or Yosemite, but it is worth going to. Its more like the size of a state park, with a few main roads and a small handful of officially designated ""attractions."" But, there few main attractions are epic! The Lehman cave tour is by far the best caves I've seen so far. The peak up at Wheeler Peak is epic. This is one of those parks where you really need to check ahead of time that you go on a day when 1) they are giving the cave tour, since the cave is not open to entry without the tour, and 2) make sure the road up to the peak is not closed due to snow. I suggest calling the visitors center to check on road status if it is during the time of year when snow may have caused a road closure. Overall, this may not be big enough of a park to warrant a full fledged trip for a week or something, but that depends on how many official attractions you are seeking. I simply spent the days after checking the caves and the peak, reading a book and enjoying being away from work! On the other hand, if you are passing through this area of Nevada, say between Utah and California, this would be a worth while side trip. You will simply be taking 50 instead of 80 through Nevada, and 50 is more scenic, but slower since it is more up-and-down / winding roads compared to 80 which is a faster straight open freeway, etc.","July 12, 2014",Small and big,25,"San Carlos, California",5

We were told that the drive up to Wheeler Peak would take up the time and would be well worth it.The ranger was quite right. Pines, creeks surrounded a small hike we went on. They offered other hikes but we did not have the time.  We returned and entered Lehman caves. It was rather amazing!","July 8, 2014",Mountain Retreat In The Desert,25,"Clearfield, Utah",5
Great Basin National Park,"I have to throw a vote of support in here for GBNP. I spent one day and one night here about two weeks ago - what a beautiful place. One of the least visited units in the National Park System and kinda easy to see why, it's pretty much in the middle of nowhere. That said, there were a few people around, the amount that I would consider to be just right. Enough to have people to talk to but not so many to disrupt the peace and quiet.I took the Wheeler Peak scenic drive & hiked the Alpine Lakes Loop - incredible scenery as you hike past two picturesque lakes. Still a fair amount of snow on the ground and up on the peaks in mid-June.I camped at Upper Lehman Campground, right beside the creek - awesome spot. With plenty of privacy and space between sites, the campground was nice & quiet despite almost filling up towards the end of the evening. Temps were cool and refreshing without ever being uncomfortable. And the night sky was stunning!Big thumbs up for this hidden gem of a park!","July 3, 2014","Beautiful, peaceful National Park!",61,"London, United Kingdom",5

Great Basin National Park,"Always wanted to visit this park, since we live in Las Vegas. We decided to make the trip a weekend adventure, and it was well worth it! We drove to Cedar City, UT on a Friday evening, since the I-15 freeway is quicker and there are more accommodation choices. Sat morning, we drove drove to Great Basin which took about 2 hours (it's a very lonely road). We had reservations to tour the Lehman Caves (recommended on the weekend) at 11:00AM, so decided to take a hike first. One of the park guides recommended the Pole Canyon Trail. The trail started with scrubby brush along the creek, but before long we were in tall pines and aspen with green grassy meadows and colorful wildflowers (June). Next we did the Grand Tour (90 minutes) in the Lehman Caves; these caves are an underground wonderland! The guided tour takes you through room after room after room of magnificent stalactite and stalagmite formations; it's so impressive! Next we drove up to Wheeler Peak (10,000 ft) and decided to hike the lovely Alpine Lakes Trail that takes you to both Stella and Teresa Lakes. This trail connects with the Bristlecone Pine Trail that leads up to an ancient grove of bristlecone pines, which are some of the oldest living things on Earth! The interpretive signs in the bristlecone pine grove explain the lives and significance of these ancient trees.

The park visitor center in Baker is nicely done and we recommend the film in their theater.

Great Basin National Park,Great Basin National Park located in East Central Nevada is a fairly new N. P. established in 1986. It has ancient bristlecone pines. These are pretty gnarly trees that probably don't exist elsewhere. The trees are amazing. The road to and through the park is a pleasant low speed adventure due to the many curves in the road. It provides a view of the the basin that is a flat valley between two mountain ranges most of us don't even know exists. There are cave tours that I am sure will enhance your visit but due to timing we were not able to take advantage of. We are glad we checked out the park as it broadened our knowledge base.,"June 21, 2014",Don't skip Great Basin N. P.,57,"Alva, Florida",4
Great Basin National Park,"We stayed in St. George, UT and drove to Great Basin National Park and then back to Las Vegas as a day trip. This is doable but I really wouldn't recommend it. This park is really in the ""middle of nowhere"". Make sure you gas up your vehicle and take lots of snacks with you when your head off to this park. The trip there from St. George took about 4 hours. The drive was really off the beaten path but the scenery was really cool. We were in the middle of a huge valley for a long time and it was actually quite beautiful with the flat land all around us and the mountains looming in front of us. We drove miles and miles and miles through this area. There were signs on the side of the road that just said ""COW"". Sure enough next to the sign would be a cow sitting either right next to the road or on the road. It was kind of funny. However, since there is nothing around you tend to drive fast so be careful as you go around bends because the cows really are there. If you had an accident out in this area it could take quite awhile for someone to find you. We very limited to no cell service for the entire trip to and from this park. Once we arrived at the park we headed into the visitor's center. The visitor's center was actually the highlight of the park for us. There were restrooms, a small area of a display of the area, and a very nice restaurant and gift shop. The rangers were very nice and helpful. If you want to do a tour of the cave, make sure you stop at the visitor's center and get your tickets. We were not dressed for cave temps so we skipped the cave tour. Perhaps if we had gone on the tour the park would have been more interesting. We decided to drive up Wheeler Peak...well as others have indicated we were there May 19th and the scenic drive was only open to the first turnout so we stopped and took a look at the peak and headed back down. There was a nighttime star gazing session but I wouldn't have wanted to be there in the dark unless you were staying overnight at a campground. For what we were able to see, it really wasn't worth the drive. The drive back to Las Vegas was even worse than the drive to the park. There really is absolutely nothing but desert to look at on the way back and it is a longer drive (about 4.5 hours). I would not go back to the park and would only recommend making a special trip there unless you are looking to cross this off your bucket list like we were!","June 20, 2014",Not My Favorite National Park,297,"Niles, Ohio",2

We also visited Lehman Caves, drove up Wheeler Peak as far as the snowline, and hiked a short nature trail. The view from the visitor center at the caves is truly breath-taking. The cafe there is fantastic -- don't miss it if you are there at lunchtime! Our grandkids did the requirements to become Junior Park Rangers and loved every minute of it, so if you have young kids in your group and will be at the park all day, be sure they participate in this fun activity.

I drove the whole length of Snake Creek and back and drove too far up Lexington Arch to find the trail was closed but someone took down the closed sign. We did stop by the Visitor Centers. We did not go into the caves - just not into caves. The wildlife was great. Huge jackrabbits, cottontails, elk, mule deer and other varmints. This is one of the newest national parks and one of the least visited parks - it shows. The lack of people is great - its like having the park to yourself.

They have a fire barrel so get your firewood at the town near the visitor center before you head up the road. The wood was $5 and was sold on the honor system opposite the gas pumps in town. (far side from the visitor center). There is a small store for food staples but it was pretty sparsely stocked. The campsite was fairly private ( we bordered only one other campsite and it was about 40 feet away). We were in a tent.

Great Basin National Park,"One of the top 10 least visited US National Parks, Great Basin National Park is located in the middle of nowhere Nevada, just west of the Utah border.I have visited several of the other least visited US National Parks (Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve in Alaska and Lake Clark National Park and Preserve in Alaska) and this park is not quite as interesting as those parks. The advantage this park has over the other remote parks is that you can easily drive here from Las Vegas, Salt Lake or Reno if you have the time. You will need time, as this park is not close to much of anything (Delta, Utah or Ely, Nevada notwithstanding).Driving to this park is easy, as there were very few cars on the road when I visited on a Saturday in April. At some points I could see empty highway stretching 5 to 10 miles out with no cars or any signs of habitation -- just endless desert and beautiful mountains.The drive is about as interesting as the park, with dry lake beds and great and vast landscapes surrounding you as you drive in from the east (Delta, Utah).The park headquarters is actually outside of the park, in Baker Nevada. Baker is a somewhat dilapidated little town that seems to host more than its share of failed small businesses that were probably built on the hopes that people would visit this national park and leave their money behind. Alas, only about 60,000 people visit this park each year, which is probably not enough to sustain much of a year-round tourist business.Sort of unique that the Park headquarters are outside of the actual Park, much like the headquarters of Wrangel/St. Elias Park where the headquarters is located in Copper Center Alaska, across the Copper river from the actual park.The mountains of the Park are interesting, as are the Lehman caves. However, there was nothing here that ""wowed"" me and I don't think I will come back.Bonus, no Park entrance fees, though you will pay a fee for the guided tour of the Lehman Caves (warning: only a few tours per day in April).Park personnel didn't seem to have much to do this time of year, looked sort of bored.Glad I visited, but I doubt I will ever visit again.","April 28, 2014",Lonely desert National Park,47,,3

During a time when parks are needing to cut back, this park seems to have figured how to do more with less. Seeing the Bristlecone pine trees that are over 5,000 years old was amazing! I highly recommend this park. I would also recommend buying a trail guide if you can. Allow some extra time to do the trails that are over 10,000 feet if you aren't used to that elevation.

Great Basin National Park,"Not the biggest of parks and located in the middle of nowhere but a great park with real diversity. The Lehman Cave - Great Palace guided tour was great, the ranger was really knowledgeable, happy to answer questions - it lasts 90 minutes and is well worth the $10 each. Rangers in the park visitor centre were really friendly and made you feel welcome.The weather was particularly awful for our 2 day visit but we managed to fit in a short hike along the South Fork Baker Trail, returning along the Timber Creek trail a round trip of just over 5 miles with an elevation gain of about 1500 ft (remember you're at altitude). Seeing through the cloud and rain the park looks real pretty. On our last day here we got up early and did an early morning hike up Wheeler Peak, a round trip of about 8 miles which is very much 4 miles up and 4 miles down, most of which is on a very loose rock surface. Combining this with the Alpine Lakes Loop (Stella and Theresa) was very rewarding, views were intermittent but enough to show that on a clear day this would be spectacular.The cafe at the Lehman Visitor Centre serves great coffee, again they are really friendly. They serve a 'famous' ice-cream sandwich which is ice-cream sandwiched between 2 giant cookies -there are several flavour combinations - chocolate chip cookie with mint choc chip is yummy. They weigh a pound so sharing is recommended - we had ours cut into quarters which made it more manageable.

I hadn't seen the Milky Way or so many stars against a pitch black sky since i was a kid. I was emotionally moved...almost to tears. It took me 7 hours to drive to the park for a single nights visit, but it was worth it and I will definitely go back.A word if caution however...though the drive to Wheeler Summit its stunning, this is not really the park for you if you just want to stay in your car and drive around.

Great Basin National Park,"Great hikes. The only problem with the management of the park is that NPS allowed a lightening strike which turned into a fire to burn for weeks closing down the Lexington Arch. I do not give a crap about future generations if this generation, and specifically me, miss my one and onlty chance to see the arch. Allowing these controlled burns has resulted in some fires bec oming uncontrolled. The NPS is not knowledgeable enough about these fires to allow them burn on purpose.No entrance fees. This is the way all parks should be run. The 2013 parks budget is $2.3 billion and if you were to divide this amount by the 313.9 million US citizens, it would cost each individual $1.02 yearly to maintain the National Parks. I am ashamed to say that a Republican President, Ronald Reagan, instituted these fees, a tax by any other name.See: The Recreation Fees and Improvements Act of 1982It would reduce the parks' budget by not having to hire expensive park rangers to sit and collect and dole out receipts for entrance fees which has to be a wash in terms of labor costs vs fees. The remaining Park Rangers could start doing what park rangers are supposed to do.","August 11, 2013","Very remote, price is right",39,Texas,4
Great Basin National Park,"This park is literally in the middle of nowhere, thus, nobody really seems to be clamoring to get there. It is a great change of pace from the amazing, yet ridiculously busy, National Parks like Yosemite or Grand Canyon. I cannot stress enough how peaceful it is in this park. We drove the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive (A MUST) and hiked the Alpine Lakes Loop and Glacier trail hikes, approx. 6 miles round trip. We saw deer on our hike, making it all the more exciting as we were hiking with our 10 yo daughter. At the Lehman Caves Visitor Center the staff host a stargazing event 3 evenings per week using several massive telescopes. We were lucky enough to have the rain stop and the clouds part right at sunset and we were treated to an amazing night sky, we saw Saturn and it's beautiful rings, among many other things. If you happen to be at GBNP on a Tues or Thurs or Sat, the stargazing is not to be missed. We did the Lehman Caves 90 minute tour. It too was spectacular and interesting. Entrance to GBNP is free. The only accommodations in GBNP are campsites, first come first served. There are several different camping areas to choose from. Upon exploring the park, we found many many empty campsites, even on a weekend in July. Otherwise, there is the tiny, TINY town of Baker, very convenient at just 5 miles from the entrance to GBNP. But, make sure you don't blink, it is small. There is one motel, two restaurants, a small grocery-like store within one of the restaurants, and a gas station. We stayed in Baker at the one motel, the Silver Jack Inn. It got the job done, though just barely (see separate review). We ate at both of the restaurants, Electrolux (adjacent to the Silver Jack Inn) and T&D's. Nothing to write home about, we were hungry, we had to eat. These are both tiny mom and pop restaurants. T&D's was far better than Electrolux, though Electrolux has a more interesting and comfortable interior.GBNP is definitely a ways out there, but it is worth the trip, especially if you want to escape, find some peace and quiet, and get off the grid for awhile.","August 9, 2013",Peace and solitude is yours at Great Basin National Park,27,"Laguna Hills, California",5

Great Basin National Park,"Instead of taking I-80 across the north of Nevada to get from Tahoe to Boulder, we decided to drive Highway 50 - the loneliest road in America - and stop at GBNP. The main reason was to see the amazing night skies....in the middle of drought season it happened to rain and be overcast the 3 nights we were there (sigh), so unfortunately that never happened. But the bristlecone pines were amazing, and hiking that trail up to the glacier is definitely worth it. We are not experienced hikers by any means, and we were fine with the trail. The ranger warned us that our 6 year old boys might not handle it, but they did fine (mind you, they are VERY active boys and tall for their age)...so I imagine older children will be fine with the hiking. On the way back, we did the little spur to the two glacial lakes, which was beautiful. We did Lehman caves...I don't do well with closed spaces, but had no problem with them...never felt claustrophobic. I would definitely recommend visiting to anyone who happens to be driving through southern Nevada/Utah, as it is a truly beautiful place. Lodging is very limited...if you camp, the camping sites in the park were in great locations...no showers but decent toilets...if you want to treat yourself, consider the Hidden Canyon Ranch.

Great Basin National Park,"I've lived in Southern Nevada for 15 years and had never heard about this park until recently. The trip from Vegas is a little less than 300 miles of open, mostly empty, two-lane highway through some of the most beautiful desert scenery in the southwest. We were there for the 4th of July weekend, and as others mentioned there were very few persons there. What struck me was there no park entrance fees. We paid to tour the Cave ($25 for three adults), but that was it. The vastness of this place is at first overwhelming. It's not until you get out of your car and onto one of the many well groomed trails that you start to appreciate the wide variety of terrain and scenery this park has. Cool mountain streams laced with flowers, aspen forests, alpine meadows, bristle cone pines (the oldest living thing on the planet), purple sage prairies, and a real live glacier are all there for hiking and exploring. With the darkest night skies in the contiguous US, the park is also one of the few places left that you can see the milky-way and watch satellites streak across the night sky. I look forward to going back during the next meteor shower. We stayed in Baker, Nv at the End of The Trail..er (see reviews), which I highly recommend as part of the overall experience. Baker is the closest to the park, being only 6 miles away from the visitor center. In Baker, there is an un-attended self-serve gas station, a couple of surprisingly good restaurants/bars with well stocked selections of hand-crafted beers and a great wine selection. Accommodations are listed here on tripadvisor. There is absolutely no cell phone coverage in Baker, and from what we experienced, none until you get to Alamo heading South on the Great Basin Hwy. I found this to be a huge plus, but be aware if you break down you are likely to be on your own for awhile. In summary, great place to slowdown and escape not that far from home.

Great Basin National Park,"If isolation and wide open spaces are what you crave, this is the national park for you. My husband and I camped here over the 4th of July weekend to escape the holiday crowds in our home town. Even on a holiday weekend, I couldn't believe how quiet and and crowd-less this place seemed when compared to the insanity of Yosemite National Park on a holiday weekend. Free to entry the park, and we camped at Strawberry creek campgrounds: a primitive campsite (no running water) just outside the parks entrance, which was also free. The campsites were relatively level, had nice picnic tables, metal fire rings, and there was a ""port-a-potty"" at the camp ground. We drove the twisting 12 mile two-lane road up to the Wheeler Peak Summit campground and did the short hike to Stella Lake. There are many beautiful vistas and the peak itself is visual stunning. In fact nothing about the name of ""Great Basin"" national park suggests the towering mountain that makes up this place. We took our telescope to look at the stars since this place is lauded as one of the darkest places in the continental US, but we got shut out with rain every night we were there.

Great Basin National Park,"It was 305 miles each way from the Las Vegas strip - a very long day trip. More on that later.As for the park, I did the one-hour tour of the Lehman cave. It is a nice cave, but comparable to other caves I have seen elsewhere. Also, the cave is mostly dry with only a little water dripping through. I personally prefer caves with active waterflow because the formations look better when wet (most in Lehman were dry). So, I don't think it is worth going to the park just for the cave, unless you have a special interest in the features of this cave.The Wheeler peak hikes were good. The ranger recommended starting at the Wheeler peak hike trailhead and then following the Alpine Lakes trail to the Bristlecone and Glacier trails. That is a good plan, providing nice views of the lakes, Mt Wheeler, the bristlecone pines and the glacier valley. I spent about 3 hours on the hike.There was no admission charged to enter the park. The one-hour cave tour was $8.Overall, this is a nice place to visit, especially considering the harshness of the surrounding area. But it is very isolated and not along the path of any typical travel itinerary. So you need to be the judge if it is worth it for you.As for the drive from Vegas, it was 305 miles from the Riviera Hotel to the Mount Wheeler trailhead. I was driving as fast as reasonable (about 80 mph wherever possible) and it took 4.5 hours each way. One surprise along US 93 was the lake and green landscape around the Pahranagat Wildlife refuge. There is a mountainous area and some Joshua trees west of Caliente. As you proceed north the landscape becomes somewhat less severe desert. But in general you are driving in mostly-flat valleys with small-to-medium mountain ranges on both sides - typical Great Basin landscapes. So, it is not really a scenic drive but there are a few spots of interest. It is mainly just a long drive for a day trip. In retrospect, I would have preferred to stay overnight near the park.","July 5, 2013",305 miles from Vegas Strip,160,"Dallas, TX",4
Great Basin National Park,The reason I say this cave is a must is because it has rare shield formations. I have visited many caves but this is only one of a few that has shields.

Great Basin National Park,"Wow! Great Basin National Park's beauty took us by surprise. We were on a trip from the Mendocino Coast (Calif) to the many Nat'l Parks of southern Utah...So we decided to drive east along Nevada's Hwy 50, ""The Loneliest Highway in America""....(Now we know why it's called that)...Great Basin Nat'l Park in eastern Nevada was the highlight of this long, mostly boring drive..During our trip in late April 2013, all visitor centers were now open and very good...The road up to Wheeler Peak and the Bristlecone Pines, just 4 miles past Lower Lehman campground (where we stayed), was still closed due to snow. They do not snow plow here, only when it melts off do you get to go there. The remoteness of this whole area is alot of the appeal. It is not close by anything or not even on the road to most vacation destinations so you have to really want to go here. We loved that! So extremly un-crowded. And Quiet!  The campgrounds were great, numerous level, paved parking pads, pit toilets and trash pick-up. Remember no showers here, bring a solar shower bag like we did....Plenty of greenery and distance between sites...This early in the season the water system was not up and running yet..so we dipped water out of the creek for washing dishes, etc. But NOT drinking....And all this for a $5.00 or $ 6.00 nightly fee! Did I mention that at this time there was NO entrance fee either...Ever hear of that at a National Park? Yeah! My only complaint? Very pet un-friendly...(like all Nat'l Parks)....NO dogs on leash, on any trails, period.....So we just hiked mostly off trail with our pooch, she LOVED playing in the snow banks and taking a dip in the creek..The weather was warm even, a big bonus! Sometimes at this high elevation it can turn very quickly to winter again.Glad it didn't during our trip!","May 15, 2013",Unique and beautiful Nat'l Park,254,"Fort Bragg, California",5

Great Basin National Park,"We camped here for 3 nights in June 2011. The best national parks for my taste have either really spectacular scenery like the Grand Canyon or are near some nice resort area, like the Grand Tetons at Jacskon Hole, WY. While this park has neither (the scenary is quite nice but not as magnificent as the Rockies and there is virtually nothing near it worth visiting), it is worth a stop as part of a larger itineray. We stopped here in between stays at Zion and Arches. GBNP doesn't have flush toilets (except at the main building which is not close to the campgrounds) and there are no showers. The main attractions are the Lehman Caves and the bristlecone pine trees that are said to be the the oldest living things on earth.There were a lot of flies at the campsite during the day, probably because of the vault toilets, but I didn't notice any mosquitos at night.Lehman Caves are not as good as Carlsbad Caverns, but are more colorful than Mammoth Cave.We wanted to stay at the Wheeler campground but it was still closed in late June so we ended up in Upper Lehman. We stayed at a site near a stream that ran through it. I will say that it's probably the best night of sleep I've ever had while camping (or maybe anytime). The sky was absolutely black except for the incredibly bright stars, there was no noise except the the stream, and the air was crisp, clean and refreshing. This is one of the best areas in the continental US for stargazing, second only to Bryce Canyon from what I've read. We saw fresh cougar prints in the snow while hiking one morning.The main drawback to the park is that if you come with kids, there isn't a wide variety of things to keep them interested, unless they're really into hiking. We ended up making a day trip to Mcgill, NV where there is a large, natural swimming hole.If Wheeler had been open I might have been able to give the park 4 stars.I would come again as a stopover between other places, but not go a long distance out of my way to visit a second time.","December 27, 2012",Pretty Nice Spot in Eastern Nevada,30,Keller,3
Great Basin National Park,"This park is a long way from anywhere, but it is well worth the trip if you enjoy seeing remote and rugged corners of the west. September was a great month to visit, with aspens turning a brilliant gold to contrast with the dark green pines. The Lehman campgrounds were full, so I had to camp in the Wheeler Peak campground at 10,000 feet. The drive up the peak is beautiful (but watch out for mule deer). It's a decent campground, though there aren't a lot of level places to pitch a tent. After dark, you'll see more stars than you ever knew existed. I highly recommend hiking up to Stella Lake at sunrise- You can leave from the Wheeler Peak campground at first light and bear right on the Alpine Lakes Loop. Then you can loop back past Teresa Lake and into the grove of gnarled, ancient bristlecone pines. Beyond that, the trail climbs rough moraine approaching the glacier. The views of the craggy peaks all around are far more rewarding than the actual glacier, though- I could've skipped the last mile or so. I was back at camp by lunchtime, so this hike took half a day even with plenty of stops for photos. Birdwatchers will also enjoy this hike with many different species present.Back down the mountain, the small but ornate Lehman Cave is certainly worth an hour of your time. It is full of intricate formations and is one of the more interesting caves I have seen. I only spent one night and didn't have time to summit Wheeler Peak, but that trail is another of the park's great attractions for more adventuresome hikers.","November 18, 2012","Beautiful, rugged and remote",7,Atlanta,4

Hike the interpretive trail and hug an ancient living tree! The lakes in the park are very pretty. Very good star gazing. Lehman caves tour was fun: two mile long cave with lots of shield formations.

Great Basin National Park,"We loved Great Basin National Park. The tour of Lehman Cave should not be missed. I have never been interested in a cave tour and just went along because my husband wanted to go. It was spectacular. Now we are looking at other places for cave tours. We had my son and my six year old granddaughter with us, and both loved it. If your child can do it, I highly recommend the 90 minute tour. Our ranger was very knowledgeable and personable. We would have liked to have stayed longer. The scenic drive up to Wheeler Peak is well worth it. The road is paved and not too difficult. This would be a great activity for someone who has difficulty walking. The views are breathtaking. We hiked the Bristlecone Pine Trail. It is not especially difficult, and is only about 3 miles, but it is at 11,000 feet. The six year old had no problems. It is well worth the climb. When we arrived, there was a ranger there who answered all our questions and gave us lots of info on these 3,000-5,000 year old trees. Truly spectacular. We were there on June 8 and did see snow. Great Basin National Park is supposed to be the darkest place in the continental US. The star gazing is just phenomenal. We had hoped to go to the ranger presentation and use the telescopes, but it starts at 8:30 or 9 and lasts a couple of hours. The 6 year old just couldn't do it. We had worn her out with hikes. This park is a little known gem. It does not get visited any where near as often as the Utah parks, so no crowds!  We also got the kids' backpack and the Junior Ranger packet as soon as we got to the park. If you haven't done this with your kids, it is great. They do some activities and earn a badge or a pin from the park. The backpack is filled with activities and equipment to help kids enjoy the park. You can take the backpack for longer than the day if you are willing to give them your credit card number in case you don't return it or any of the contents are lost. They have these things available at all the parks we have gone to in the west. All three generations recommend this park.","June 8, 2012",Wonderful park!,24,Newburyport,4

The park is very remote, with fewer visitors than many parks, which was pleasant for our camping. It is a relatively small park. Most of the trails are a tad long for the casual visitor and you can easily see all of the park that is accessed by paved roads in less than a day.

Great Basin National Park,ShePanther says: Out of no where we landed in a sanctuary. The Panther family set up camp at Upper Lehman campground. Beautiful! After walking the grounds we found secluded camps with small streams running along most sites. After a restful nights sleep under a vast display of stars we headed to see the cave. Panther-Tip-If you have kids 5 and under you cannot do the 90 minute tour only the 60 minute tour is allowed. So be sure to check the tour times specific to the age group of your family. When driving from Baker to the Lehman Caves visitor center be sure to watch for weirdness along the fences. We spent the weekend and cannot wait to go back. HePanther says: Make sure and get tickets for the cave first as it was sold out early. Not much room in the tour ... maybe 12 or so? This park felt like going back in time with the easy going attitude and under abused campgrounds. I couldn't believe how nice it was to see improved camping how it used to be thirty years ago. Also we took the scenic drive and ended up around 10000 feet above sea level. The views were great and we saw lots of great things while the mini panthers had a rest in the car.

Great Basin National Park,"We spent two days at the park. First day was hiking to Wheeler's Peak at 13,000+ feet. I recommend getting an early start, bring layered clothing, sturdy hiking books, water and food. We started from the parking lot which is 10,000 ft. Good thing we trained beforehand as the high altitude takes a toll. The trail through the woods on up to the treeline was very pleasant and not too strenuous. Once past the treeline, we experienced a fairly brisk wind and dropping temperatures. A light coating of snow was on the trail. The trail consisted of rocks and small boulders making the climb tough, especially if you are a small person with shorter legs. Going was slow, but steady. My husband did make it to the top. I stopped about 1,000 feet below, exhausted. The climb down was very slow as you have to watch each step down off of the rocks and boulders. Weather up there can change in an instant. Once down and into the trees, we looked back and all clouds disappeared leaving the peak baking in the sun. That hike was about 6 hours round trip. Second day spent hiking through the bristlecone pine forests and standing on a glacier. Very cool. Good trails and slightly strenous in a few sections, not bad though. Beautiful scenery. That hike was about 3 hours, including a stop for lunch on a log. We tried for a tour at Lehman Caves, but all tours were sold out that day. There are campgrounds in the park (all sold out that day) and a couple motels in the town of Baker. No fee to get into the park.

Great Basin National Park,"Lehman caves were awesome. We debated and took the 90 minute tour. The youngest child we had with us was 8, but I could see down to age 5 being fine on the longer tour. It took us to the Grand Palace which was well worth it. My kids would have been disappointed if the guide had said we couldn't see it all and taken us out where the 60 minute tour ended. Bring your own flashlight so you can look in the nooks and crannies after the tour guide is moving forward. We took a combined hike at the top of the Wheeler Peak scenic drive. We took the Bristlecone pine hike with the added Glacier spur. The 3000 year old tree was amazing to see and think about it. It is amazing they are still alive. It was worth the extra distance to see the glacier and the changed landscape at the edge of the tree line. On the way back, we took the trail over to Teresa Lake on the Alpine Lakes loop. It was a nice walk through different scenery. If it was summer, I would have wanted to camp in the park. The campgrounds are very nice.
