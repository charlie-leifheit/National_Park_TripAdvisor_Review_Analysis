Mount Lassen,"Climbed Mount Lassen Peak Trail (along with several hundred, literally, 4,5,6-th graders from Rhonart Park, Sonoma, and other schools). 2000 foot elevation in 2.5 miles. Slope is actually pretty constant from the very beginning. The newly re-constructed trail is wonderful. It is a serious hike, but no climbing is involved. Also hiked into Bumpass Hell from the back - Kings Creek and Cold Boiling Lake. The main trail was supposed to open two days later. Visitor Centers have a lot of good information.","September 23, 2019",Great place for hiking,43,n/a,5
Mount Lassen,"This park seemed to take quite a while to drive to from the Bay area but we were determined to get there to discover this volcanic site. We were not dsiappointed. First stop was the Visitors Center to get our bearings and pick up some literature, learn a bit about the area by viewing a brief movie, and using the restroom before our slow drive through the park. It is truly a beautiful and awasome experience. There are a number of pull-outs to stop and take beautiful pictures. Note that the first stop has a walk trhat takes you past the mud pots and other geologic wonders. Pictures just don't capture all of the beautiful aspects of this park, but they will serve as a wonderful memory to us for all time. Not that many of our L.A. friends even know of this park, and we've been sharing our insights with them and encourage them to go and see for themselves.","September 21, 2019",What a wonderful park!,24,"Thousand Oaks, United States",5
Mount Lassen,"My wife doesn't hike and we are well into our 60s so we took an auto tour beginning at the north entrance. I have a lifetime senior pass for National Parks that got us in at no charge. The scenery is beautiful and I would rate it as good as Yellowstone or Denali if it just had a bunch of big animals like bear, buffalo, and elk. It did impress me more than Yosemite which we visited a few days previous. Lassen is popular but you won't really have to fight the crowds like you do at some other parks. It seems to have all anyone would need for hiking and camping.","September 15, 2019",VERY SCENIC,20,"Natchitoches, Louisiana",5
Mount Lassen,"We didn’t expect to have four seasons in Mt Lassen. It was a great experience for us. We did auto touring through the whole mountain, entered through manzanita lake, exited through Kohm Yah-mah-nee gate. It’s indeed a Pretty scenic, we were surprised with leftover snow on the peak. Be ready with jacket and be ready to spend few days if you want to hike. If you just want to do auto touring, you will need whole full day trip.

Mount Lassen,"They are not lying about that 2000 some foot rise in 2.5 miles! It's pretty good long hike, I believe that the sign at the bottom said 4 or 5 hours on average but I was able to do the whole thing in about 3.","August 31, 2019",Good physical therapy hike!,35,"West Yellowstone, Montana",5
Mount Lassen,"We hiked up Mount Lassen on July 24. Even then, the trail still had substantial snow. The snow was mostly on the lower third of the trail. And, the trail was well marked across the snow. The views are tremendous from the moment the trail begins. This is only a 5 mile round trip hike but the summit is at 10,457 feet. Another huge bonus: Lassen Volcanic Park is not highly visited. There were definitely other visitors on the trail, but we had the summit all to ourselves. Pretty spectacular!!","August 26, 2019",Loved this hike!,218,"Marietta, Georgia",5
Mount Lassen,"We went up Lassen in early August on a sunny cloudless day. Even with an early start, we knew it was going to be quite warm. There was little shade on the trail. The views were terrific all along the trail as we switchbacked up the mountain. Halfway up, we were greeted with a deluge of orange-&-black tortoiseshell butterflies streaming down the mountainside. At the peak was a vast snowfield. The elevation gain is 2000 feet with a trail length of about 2.5 miles (5 miles round trip), so it is not a very difficult climb. Nevertheless, if you have joint or stamina issues, this may not be the hike for you. All in all, we loved the hike.","August 14, 2019",Lovely views all along the way on a challenging hike,35,Connecticut,5

Mount Lassen,"We did the trail up Mount Lassen in a great hot summer day (but not extremely hot) with a light overcast sky. These conditions make the walk perfect: not to warm, not to cold. Was the weather warmer then things could get really hot, really fast, so go prepared with water for everybody! On the other hand at the top of the peak temperatures are much lower than down in the car park so be ready to take some light warm jackets just in case (we did not needed them only because the wind was from the right side... and we were protected by some rocks in the summit). The path follows a steady (and relentless) gentle slope with amazing views all the way up, and breathtaking 360 vistas as the top. Be prepared: there will be some crossings over snow, so adequate shoes is a must), and some sections are near big exposed slopes that may not be enjoyable for people that don't like heights. We visited in august weekday and we met people in the tray but it was not crowded at all, and in the top it was 5 or 6 of us (and the area is spacious).","August 8, 2019","Feels longer than it is, but its just a question of stamina. The prize is great up there!",10,"Porto, Portugal",5
Mount Lassen,"Four of us went to Lassen Volcano National Park for July 4th - 5th. It was fun! Since parts are high elevation we got to throw snowballs and walk in snow on July 4th. Not only were there thermal features (like a mini-Yellowstone), but geology of volcanics including all the various types of volcanoes are present in the park. Unfortunately some of the roads in the park are not connected, meaning you have to enter from different areas to get some places. Due to our time limits we didn't get a chance to see some of those. Also we didn't want to hike on the snow-covered areas, but there was plenty of information about conditions in each area so we knew what to expect. This is a worth a visit, although not as beautiful as the top rated National Parks.","August 6, 2019",Snow on July 4th,17,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",4

Mount Lassen,"A magical 5 mile round trip hike with 2,000' elevation gain to the summit of nearly 10,500'. We completed it in a little over 4 hours on 7/31/19. Near perfect conditions, cool breeze, minimal snow crossings, not too crowded and thousands of California Tortoiseshell butterflies swirling around the mountaintop for the last mile or so of the trail. It pays to plan a trip around conditions to account for snow, high temperatures and forest fires. Not an easy hike as it is rated difficult in many hiking guides, but we did meet two 80 year olds with pacemakers making the climb although both were experienced hikers. Make sure you hydrate and bring enough fluids.","August 3, 2019",Lassen Peak Trail - Bucket List Worthy,36,"Santa Rosa, California",5

Mount Lassen,"We visited via the North entrance to Lassen Volcanic National Park. The museum was there but closed in May. Manzanita Lake was so large and pretty and this part of the park was beautiful. We were able to drive in 10 miles to the devastated area. There was a lot of snow there and you had to walk if you wanted to go further. There are 4 types of volcanoes in the park.

The colors are stunning, green grass, white snow, red pine needle paths! There is something at this national park for all ages. The visitor centers are excellent, there are suggested search games for kids, everything is well groomed in the park, and there are choices of small hikes and huge hikes.

Mount Lassen,"I've been going to Lassen since I was 8 years old. Our family moved to Northeastern California in 1969. The park is filled with history, which was probably more interesting before 1980. You see, at that time, it was the only volcano that had erupted in the lower 48. When Mt. St. Helens blew up in 1980, people have tended to forget Lassen. That's good if you want less crowding. Most people who visit California's National Parks head to Sequoia and Yosemite. They tend to not want to travel all the way up to Lassen. There are abundant trails, from short to quite long. There are bubbling sulphur works and mud. There is a trail to hike the summit of Mt Lassen. Kings Creek Meadows is beautiful, and the source of the North Fork of the Feather River.","May 31, 2019",Lesser known National Park--shhh!,10,"Lincoln, Nebraska",5
Mount Lassen,"Mount Lassen (10,457') is the centerpiece of Lassen Volcanic National Park. The peak is what remains of a lava dome volcano that erupted several times between 1914 and 1917. It is still considered to be an active volcano, and is closely monitored. The park protects the surrounding geothermal ecosystem and provides educational and recreational opportunities. A spectacular scenic drive (CA89) passes through the park and around the eastern flank of Mount Lassen. The two-lane highway is paved and about 30 miles long, with views of the peaks and alpine lakes along the way. Note that the road is typically closed in the winter (November-May) due to heavy snowfall. A NPS pass or entrance fee is required; $10-30 depending on the time of year and mode of transportation. There are two visitor centers at either end of the park with interesting exhibits and information to help plan your visit. Numerous hiking trails of various lengths and difficulties provide access to the mountain wilderness. We visited in August and the park was not crowded. The landscape was very green and there were many wildflowers blooming. We were traveling with a wheelchair so that limited our activities, but we enjoyed the Sulphur Works geothermal area and the easy trail through the Devastated Area which has interpretive signs about the 1915 eruption.","April 13, 2019",Beautiful Volcanic Wilderness,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4
Mount Lassen,"The main road wonders through the park over a meandering 28 miles. A full day with frequent stops allows for 3 short hikes. These can be very interesting from a geologic standpoint, or absolutely beautiful if hiking a stream with water falls. Weather in the fall can be cool, but there are no mosquitoes and few crowds. Hiking to the summit is an all day expedition from the south entrance. Only attempt it if you are an experienced mountain climber and have carefully checked the weather. Weather near the summit can change very rapidly. Taking 2 days to explore is really the best way to enjoy this park. Even if not doing a lot of hiking, have good shoes and if going up a steep trail, hiking boots and trecking poles are recommended.","March 22, 2019",A wonderful place to explore in the uncrowded fall,48,"Klamath Falls, Oregon",4

Mount Lassen,"Despite the neighboring fires all across California, the lassen park was refreshingly clear of smoke. I live that it is not nearly as crowded as Yosemite. The dark sky festival was amazing, a must see. Lassen park has some of the darkest sky in the country, ideal for sky viewing. It gets cold at night, but camping is super fun. Campgrounds are well maintained. Overall, I LOVE Lassen National park. I’ve been here more than a dozen times in the past 4 years and will keep coming back.

Mount Lassen,"Honestly, I know Mount Lassen has a lot to offer. It is beautiful. I remember going as a teen and hiking the mountain, visiting the devastated area, etc. For some reason, though, on this trip it felt like we were only able to drive to a couple of spots before we had to stop and there wasn't a lot to do. Getting help wasn't easy, either. I was disappointed in how little info was available to help me find my way around. ","July 27, 2018","Beautiful, but confusing",7,"Marysville, California",4

Mount Lassen,"This review is about the hike up Mount Lassen on July 22. I’m 41 and in decent shape.So what’s important-Firstly, the weather-it is much cooler and windier at the top. So ask the ranger, check your weather sources.Do you need hiking boots? Yes, you do. Don’t attempt in sandals.Bring a hat, windbreaker, wear sunscreen as a lot of the trail is exposed to the sun.Carry at least 750-1000 ml of water, snacks etc.What’s the best time? Probably early to late morning-it’s pleasant at the top noon to mid-afternoon temperature wise (60’s) and this will give you enough time to plan ascent/descent.How tough is the trail? I would say strenuous. It’s 2.5 miles but a 2000 feet climb. I did it 2-2.5 hours up and 1-1.5 hours down with a few breaks. Is the trail treacherous? No, not really. But it’s on rock and although it is well kept, there are still pieces of rock, boulders that drop off in the trail. Also, brief stretches of snow. What should you watch out for-climbers that run downhill. I found people who were trying to jog down the most ridiculous. More than putting themselves at risk, they were putting others on the ascent in a tricky spot. Another place to be careful is at the transition of switchbacks-and there are many! Also, the true summit is a further 100 feet from the landing at the top and the trek to that is more difficult. Avoid to be safe, there are the same vistas to be had at the landing.Should a person scared of heights do it? Probably not.I saw numerous wildflowers, gorgeous white-bark pine and Clark’s nutcracker along with tortoiseshell butterflies. The view from the top is stupendous!","July 24, 2018","Enthralling, breathtaking - literally!",22,"Charlottesville, Virginia",5

I drove from one side Highway 36 entrance all the way through and came out and took Highway 299 to I-5 toward Redding. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. It is a beautiful place to visit. The Volcano is still releasing sulfur and steaming. The lakes, ponds, streams, mountains and streams are noteworthy! The drive is exciting because of the narrow roads and steep hills. You just have to see it for yourself! Do it!","July 9, 2018",Very Interesting and Historic,4,"Wheatland, California",4

Mount Lassen,"We visited the park, doing the very pretty drive. Some of the best hiking trails were closed - which was disappointing. These included the best trails for seeing thermal activity. I did he hike up to the pea of Mt Lassen which was fantastic. Steady uphill hike. I kept a brisk pace and it took me 1 3/4 hours to get up. I think most hikers took 2-3 hours up and much less coming down. Some slippery, snow-covered areas (June) but mostly a nice trail. The views from the top were fantastic. It was a clear day and Mt Shasta was in the distance. Loved this hike.","July 9, 2018",Beautiful Park - and great hike up the mountain,4,"Durham, North Carolina",4

Each hike is a different experience from beautiful wild flower filled meadows (paradise meadows) to boiling lakes ( boiling lake trail), to steep and rocky jumbles ( chaos crags) to leisurely strolls (manzanita lake), to fumaroles and mudpots (right along the main road), to the most amazing stream waterfall we’ve ever seen! (Kings creek). The hike markers on the trails are not exactly true and plan to hike a bit longer then they say but the trails are well marked.

How many chances do you have to hike up a volcano? Awesome views!!! Smoke from nearby wildfires came in the morning we hiked up, but it made a cool fog-effect. We usually start our hikes early in the morning...by the time we were done the parking lot was filling up and tons of people were hiking up...in black clothing during a sunny day (many turned around before we left...probably because they weren't fit enough or weren't prepared to hike in the heat...I can never understand those who start strenuous hikes at the part of the day that starts getting hot).

The weather can change quickly but that all adds to the fun and beauty of a lovely stunning national park thats well worth a days visit.","October 19, 2017",A great national park,344,"Reading, United Kingdom",5
Mount Lassen,"Had a fab hike up to the summit of Lassen on a hot day in early September with snow around from the last season! Great views and actually quite a simple hike, but takes around 3-4 hours in total. ","October 18, 2017",Great Hike,6,"Cumbria, United Kingdom",5
Mount Lassen,"Lassen is a national treasure, to be sure. It's the jewel of Northern California, affording expansive meadows, pristine lakes and stream and fabulous hiking trails. We stayed at the legendary Draksbad Guest Ranch and loved every minute! We hiked, road horseback, explored the Visitor's Center and shot photos to our hearts delight. What a phenomenal, well-managed gem of America. Thank you, NPS. Lassen, we love you!","October 17, 2017",A Jewel of Northern California,643,washington state,5
Mount Lassen,"I can't believe I haven't heard about this beautiful park until recently. Such a beautiful park and not as crowded as Yosemite or Sequoia Park. We've been visiting the park for two days while staying at Airbnb in Redding for a night. Luckily, we checked the wether and decided that staying in a tent wouldn't be a great idea. We hiked Lassen Peak on our first day. Even though my friend and I are in a good shape, it wasn't super easy for us to get all the way up to the top. We were not in a hurry and made multiple stops on our way up. The view was definitely worth the effort! The peak was still covered in snow and we could also see mount Shasta far away. We stayed there for a little and went back down, which was fast and easy. Take warm clothes with you, bring water, and apply plenty of sunscreen. Don't be scared that the hike is not easy, with many stops anyone can do it.","October 16, 2017",Worth the long uphill hike,27,"San Francisco, California",5
Mount Lassen,"Visited Lassen in early October and the weather was perfect. Hiked Lassen Peak and took about 2 to 3 hours to ascend and about half that to descend. The trail is well maintained. Not too rocky. We used hiking poles as it was recommended but is doable without them. The views were spectacular and worth the effort to reach the peak. There was still enough snow, that some hikers had reached the peak to ski down it! If you don't have time to hike and stop at the various points of interest, you can drive through the park in an hour. We did not venture over to Warner Valley or Butte Area. Another hike for spectacular scenery is Brokeoff Mountain. It's longer and requires more effort but is supposed to have the best views for the effort. Something to think about. The park was not crowded when we visited so we did not run into issues for parking at the various trailheads.","October 11, 2017",A hidden gem,32,Pennsylvania,5
Mount Lassen,"Out in the boonies, but really worth the effort to get there. We had researched the Park before coming. But we were surprised and impressed at the thermal features and the importance of the area volcanically (is that a word?).They have a nice Visitor Center (that serves food, unusual at NP Visitor Centers). Our first stop was the video. Very good overview of the park and its geologic history. It's an amazing place with a recent eruption (as recent as 1921) and a number of thermal features - boiling ponds, mud pots, fumaroles. We hiked to Bumpass Hell (interesting story behind the name). It was a nice hike. The trail was a bit bumpy with lots of rocks and big elevation change at the end near the thermal basin. Nice hike. And the thermal basin is other-worldly.After our hike, we drove through the Park to the north entrance. Beautiful drive. At the north entrance it the Loomis Museum - a combination museum/Visitor Center. There are displays of the volcano and the native peoples. Of particular interest to me were photographs taken early in the 20th Century of the Lassen Peak eruption. Amazing that anyone got a photograph of the eruption at that time.We enjoyed a sandwich at the Campground Store. Very good sandwich. Not gourmet, but surprisingly good. Worth a stop if you're hungry.","October 11, 2017",Surprising and Exciting Find,323,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",4

Lots of neat things to see, including a mountain of sand in a box that changed colors as you would wave your hand over it. Informative museum had many surprises and their was a nice gift shop.

Mount Lassen,"The hiking ascent to Lassen Peak starts straight from the large carpark and continues at a steady pace for most of the 2.5 miles to the top. It's unsheltered from the sun and wind and is all at altitude but as long as these aren't an issue, the path to the summit plateau is achievable by anyone. Veterans and children both made it up in between 1 and 3 hours. The last small ascent to the peak is trickier and was across snow and then a scramble to the small rocky peak so requires a little skill and experience but is really unnecessary for fantastic views (weather depending) in almost all directions. It was one of the highlights of our holiday.","September 23, 2017","Great views, well-maintained track",152,,5
Mount Lassen,"Hiking up Mount Lassen is one of the things I would absolutely try to do during a visit to Lassen Park. I certainly not call it an easy hike but it is certainly a doable hike for most people. The challenges are that it is uphill the whole way up, the trail is almost entirely in the sun and finally you are hiking at high elevations so it is more difficult to breathe as you ascend the 2,000 feet. With that being said how many opportunities do you have to reach the top of a mountain, and in this case one of the most recently active volcanoes in the United States? The trails are in pretty good condition and if you take your time and go at a pace you are comfortable with this is a very doable hike. The views from the top are fantastic.","September 18, 2017",Worth The Effort,112,"Freeport, Pennsylvania",5

Mount Lassen,"One day trip through Lassen on Labor Day. Not crowded. Was hot. No bugs though. Was surprised not more thermal features close to roads/parking. Might say Loomis museum better than the main visitor center on south side of park. BE sure to use the audio tour -- I used the printed transcript. And next time, from north side be sure to take a lunch instead of having to wait until get to south side -- there's nothing in between for eats. Manzanita Lake itself did not excite me but the path down there from Loomis gave me several good pictures. Sounds like the Dark Skies event in summer is worth doing.","September 6, 2017",Not Spectaclar but good,37,"Sedona, Arizona",4
Mount Lassen,"This is a moderately strenuous hike with very little shade along the way, so recommend to do this early in the day during hot summer months. There were a lot of tourists out but it did not feel overcrowded. The views are pretty nice. It took us 3 hours to ascent, 1 hour to get back down the mountain. The trail is mostly small rocks and pebbles but there was very little sliding despite the unsteady surface. There are opportunities to explore rock formations at the top of you walk past the snow field and away from the crowds. Better view from there, too. Overall, a very fun hike! ","September 3, 2017",View is nice but not spectacular,9,,4
Mount Lassen,"Always cool to be hiking on snow in the summer! We headed up in the early morning to catch the sunrise on the trail. Easy to follow, the trail goes up and up .... and up! 2000 feet elevation gain, starting around 8500 feet, so although not difficult in distance or difficulty, it is a constant 5 mile (round trip) grind. The views make it worth while. If I could only do one hike, it would be Bumpass Hell, but if my wife were asked which hike she would say Lassen Peak.","September 2, 2017",Strenuous hike to great views,36,"Walworth, New York",5
Mount Lassen,"We visited Lassen in July and the whole experience was surreal. You go from 90 degree weather to snow covered and iced over lakes within minutes. Had to park at Bumpass Hell Parking lot about a mile south because snow clearing was still in progress. Looped around Lake Helen as suggested by the ranger and did some back country hiking. The first 2.5 miles was all snow, the last mile was above the treeline and the trail had been cleared. Had a nice lunch at the summit before starting back down. The blast crater at the summit from the 1915 eruption is visible but was filled with snow. There is literally no shade the last 1.5 miles so bring your hats!","September 2, 2017",Hike of the year,4,"San Diego, California",5
Mount Lassen,"I live only 60 miles from The Lassen Peak trailhead, so for me it's a day trip. The park seems to have ample campgrounds and I noticed several cabins for rent in the area. But I went to hike Lassen Peak. The trail guide says it's 5miles round trip, but my Fitbit said 7. The elevation at peak is 10,437. The trail is uphill the entire hike. Lots of switch backs. The last half mile it turned into loose gravel and rock and very steep. Several places have stairs. The high altitude increased the difficulty level. With all that being said I saw people of all sizes and shapes and all ages from 5 to 80. They all had one thing in common. 'Make it to the top!' And it was worth it. The view was beautiful! I was wearing really good sneakers and they were fine but most were wearing hiking boots. I would recommend trekking poles, especially for coming down. Lots of loose gravel. There was still patches of snow you had to traverse. If you go early it's not so crowded but as I was coming down about noon it was getting busy. NO RESTROOM AT SUMMIT. Definitely bring a day pack for water bottle and windbreaker. It's very windy up top and chilly next to the snow pack.

Mount Lassen,"This is one of the best mountain climbs in California. While it's doable for most people (the trail is very well maintain, can be done in sandals, it takes about 2-3 hours to climb, no special equipment needed - just bring a liter of water or so) and we've seen a lot of elementary school kids and seniors making it to the top, it's has all attributes of a ""real"" mountain climb - a great peak, spectacular views, snow year around and thin air - but all in moderation. Plan to spend 3-5 hours. A couple things to think of. If it's a sunny day - either cover your skin or put some sunscreen on. Also, it's usually about 10F lower on top and could be windy, so you might want to take some wind break jacket.","August 21, 2017",Very rewarding hike!

Mount Lassen,"Went here as a local alternative to Yellowstone. Not disappointed.First off, it is far less tourist infested than either Yellowstone or Yosemite but is similarly spectacular.We were there in late july and there was still lots of snow on the ground - so much that the trail to Bumpass Hell was still closed.I guess you can do this as a day trip, but the best way is to camp there. Not a lot of sites, but several (most?) are first-come, first served so forget showing up late on a weekend. We arrived in the early evening on a Saturday and had to backtrack to Red Bluff to get a room for the night. The next morning however, we had our pick of sites near the lake. One thing though if you camp. Bring all the food and ice you need for your stay. While there is a camp store near the north entrance and one about 8 miles from the south in Mineral, the selections are limited and basic. Soda by the can rather than six-pack for example. Other than that, take your pick of hikes based on your physical condition, time and equipment. We did King Creek to the waterfall (pretty easy) and Ridge Lake (ball buster - 1000' vertical in 1.1 miles) as well as a hike to some steam vents on the southeast side of the park (requires going out east to Chester). We were told that Lassen peak would still require crampons and an ice axe - in late June.","August 13, 2017",Magnificent and not over-touristed,79,"Orange County, California",5
Mount Lassen,"I am from Kansas and not much of a mountaineer, but I have been hiking for more than 10 years and have hiked a couple of Colorado fourteeners. This hike was spectacular and pleasant all the way up and all the way down. The trail is a wide gravel path with switchbacks so the gain is do-able. We had quite a bit of snow in July and were glad we had crampons and trekking poles, but we saw plenty of people with no gear on. The hike took about 6 hours for us flat-landers. Why not take your time and enjoy it? Even if you don't make it to the top, there is a spectacular overlook at the half-way point. My group was treated to thousands of butterflies playing in the wind - such a magical experience. I would do this hike every year if I lived nearby.

We were unable to see many of the big attractions such as Bumphass Hell as part of park road was closed in late June due to snow, so be aware that snow can be an issue. Cinder cone was absolutely amazing hike. If the south part of park road is closed past Sulphur Works it's not worth making the drive to the south entrance for the visitor center if you are staying at the Manazanita cabins by northwest entrance. Recommend the cabins for budget visitors.","August 11, 2017",Amazing park if you love geology,129,blacksburg,5
Mount Lassen,Snow is still on this Mount and 4 days ago it looked like a shark. Would have been a picture for Shark Week. There is still enough snow to sled in and make snow balls in your tank top and shorts. Plenty of water and surrounding areas are green and healthy. It was the first time I ever saw a butterfly migration over areas of snow. The wildflowers in the meadows are spectacular. This was my first time in this area and I wonder why it took this world traveler so long to get there. I have lived in California all my life and camping in the nearby Hat Creek area was perfect.

Mount Lassen,"My wife and I were roaming without an itinerary from Lake Tahoe to Portland and might have missed this relatively unknown park if not for comments by a waiter at breakfast one morning before we left Lake Tahoe. We are very, very fortunate he spoke up - it is a wonderful park, unique in that it is the only “volcanic” National Park. There are two visitor centers, ours had an informative twenty-minute film that did an excellent job explaining the volcanic activity that shaped the park. The most interesting area in this huge area was the “area of desolation” - a place in the park you can see the destruction caused by the volcano that includes spectacular views of Mt. Lassen as well as a nice half mile walk that is curated with audio stations along the way. The place we really wanted to see - Bumpus Hell - was inaccessible due to snowpack in August! We did get a glimpse of a small, bubbling mud cauldron as we drove the park and stopped at one of the many places with signage and explanations.Every National park has something it claims to be unique - and technically might be - but Lassen really is unique in how one can learn and see the impact of relatively recent volcanic activity.

Mount Lassen,"The hike up Lassen Peak goes from 8500 ft elevation at the parking lot to 10,425 ft elevation at the top. The trail zigs and zags with some loose shale, some slippery snow and some mud in places. The views are extraordinary all along. However , just know that at these elevations you are getting about 70% less oxygen per breath than down in The Valley - this is indeed Rare Air. So your heart will beat faster, your legs will get tired quicker, and you will need more frequent rests. On the way up plan for extra time. Snow is up there even in August, and we even had rain showers with 45 degrees in August while down in Redding it was sunny and 100 degrees.","August 8, 2017",Rare Air - but exhilarating ,25,,5
Mount Lassen,The park is quite pretty but access is limited to a 10 mile stretch of a road after entering the park.The road was blocked because snow had not been cleared which limits travel in the park.Shortly after entry there is a nice lake with a trail around it which is worth walking.The walk is beautiful with also good mountain views.At the Northeast corner is a place called Cinder cone accessed by a unpaved road.6 miles later is the Butte Lake campground from which a trail starts uphill to the base of Cinder cone a volcano with a caldera on top.The climb from the base to the top is pure hell because walking on lava gravel is very difficult and a lot of fitness is needed.In July it was hot plus one needs a lot of water.I only made it halfway but my daughter went to the top and found amazing views so well worth it All in all a very nice park to visit.,"July 27, 2017",Visit to Lassen National park,8,"Hanoi, Vietnam",4

However, the initial part of trail is fully covered in snow for which I would highly recommend crampons and hiking poles. There are few patches of snow that you would need to cross during the rest of the hike. But that's the challenge. It is doable, but took longer than what we usually take for such hikes.

One mistake we made was that we were at the KOA on the wet side of the park, and only the south entrance was open.

Mount Lassen,"Hiking to the summit of Mount Lassen (Lassen Peak) is a challenge but it is very rewarding as we had wonderful views along every step of the trail. Plus when we made the hike we were treated to dazzling displays of wildflowers and a few animal sightings along the trail. We completed several hikes during our trip that also included Redwood and Crater Lake National Parks, but the hike to the top of Mount Lassen was near the top of the list.We made the hike in early August (the 10th). “We” is my wife, her sister and me. We are all in our early 50s and in good shape. Hiking is our main activity when traveling as we spend a lot of time in the National Parks. We had a lovely day for this hike, but cloud cover rolled in as the day progressed. The weather is something to be aware of when making this hike as you do NOT want to be on this exposed mountain side in the event of a storm. But for us the clouds provided no threat, rather they just added to the beauty of the vistas.The trailhead parking is about a 30 minute drive from the Manzanita Lake entrance of the park and is situated right off the main park road. We arrived in the parking lot about 8:45 and found the lot to only be about a quarter full. There are outhouses nearby and it is a good idea to visit the little houses before we started the climb as there is absolutely no place to take a break along the trail.The trailhead is at about 8400 feet above sea level. The trail climbs right at 2000 feet over about 2.5 miles to the top of Mount Lassen, which measures in at 10,463 feet. It is uphill all the way along long grades and switchbacks. Due to the altitude and the elevation change, we spent yesterday on flatter trails (Bumpass Hell then Cold Boiling Lake) to get acclimated. We figured we would be setting a slow pace with many breaks as our Ohio lungs would not be used to these conditions.  The trail starts with an uphill grade and never really lets up all the way to the top. There is a scar from an old social trail that extends from the official trail and goes straight up the side of the mountain. The scar was created by hikers who felt that the trail was not for them and decided to make their own route up the slope. Years of this disregard by these thoughtless folks had created the scar which will take decades to heal, provided that future hikers stick to the maintained trail. There is a sign at the turn in the trail where the social trails begins and shows a Photoshopped image of the mountain side sans scar. The message on the sign also indicated that “future of this trail is in our hands” as the Park Service will close the trail to all but guided hikes to ensure there will be no further damage. That would be a shame, but if that is what is necessary to protect the fragile landscape then so be it. The message also encouraged visitors to politely ask hikers who were off the trail to return to it and to report any flagrant abuse of the trails. In addition to the informational sign there was an “Area Closed” sign and a low wall built between the official and social trail, so someone would have to blatantly ignore a set of warnings to take that trail, but there are plenty of folks out there who think the rules don’t apply to them. But the good news was that we saw no one attempting this steep climb today. Once through the initial switchbacks, we got a short break as the trail climbed gently through a couple meadows and some sparse trees. Then the serious uphill hike started as we worked steadily upward through a seemingly never ending series of switchbacks. But as we climbed we were rewarded with wonderful views of big vistas as well as interesting scenes right along the trail plus more nuggets of information from the signs scattered along the trail. The trail was steep but an easy one to walk, well, most of the way, as there were no roots to trip over and for most of the way the trail surface was pretty well packed. There were only a couple places where stairs had been build, I bet there were less than 100 stair steps the whole way. So this was a strenuous hike but an easy trail, if you know what I mean. This was also a very friendly trail. I think trails should have a friendliness rating and this one would get high marks. Folks were chugging along at whatever pace they could manage but there was a lot of friendly banter and encouraging words along the trail. Maybe part of it was knowing we were all working toward the same goal, I don't know, but it just made for a more pleasant day. Perhaps a quick stop to chat with our fellow hikers just gave us all an excuse for a breather.Speaking of opportunities to pause, the Park Service gave us plenty. When not pausing to look at the vistas or watch the varmints, there were also several signs, mostly at the switchback turns. They described the mountain, the volcanic activity of the area, and the critters. They also had the distance to the top so we could track our progress up Mount Lassen. The only problem with this was that the numbers indicating the distance remaining just did not seem to get smaller fast enough! We took 2:24 to get to the “top” of the mountain. The point where the trail dumps out is almost at the top and has a few more interpretive signs and affords wonderful views. But it is not the high point. To reach the official summit, there is a snow field to traverse and a final scramble to the peak. DW and SIL opted out of this last little climb but I had to give it a go. This final stretch was short but steep and rocky. The route was just a goat trail, really. But I made it easily. There were a dozen or so other intrepid folks up here as well. I found a nice place to take a seat so that I could enjoy the view while having a snack. Including my scramble up to the peak, we were at the top of the mountain for about 40 minutes or so before we started the return hike. The trip down was easy and allowed us to continue to enjoy the views in all directions. The number of hikers coming up the trail had dramatically increased since this morning. The clouds had also increased as well, and they had a darker look to them. It did not look like a storm was really brewing but still I was glad to be heading down instead of up under that sky. We made pretty good time back down the trail arriving back at the parking lot at 1:30. Great hike! Tough, yes, but well worth the effort to see those views and just to be able to say you were at the top of a volcano. The hike took us just under 4:30 covering 4.9 miles, about 2:15 to get to the top and 1:20 for the return trip. We were huffing and puffing going up, but the return trip was easy. But we were quite tired by the time we returned to the trailhead. Our next stop was at the Manzanita Lake camp store for some well-deserved ice cream.","February 20, 2017",Hiking to the top of a volcano!,918,"Ohio, USA",5

Refreshing, invigorating air worked our appetites for the evening meal. The dark clouds signaling that evening's rain were looming over Mr. Lassen, so we cut our visit short to return to the KOA campground just 12 miles back towards Redding on Hwy 44.

Mount Lassen,"We had never really heard of Lassen National Volcanic Park until we were driving north along the California Sierras and there is was. While the park staff at the fancy new information centre at the south end (not the NPS best) were the most unhelpful that we have found, the park in itself made up for it. We were directed to Warner Valley as some of the more popular hiking trails were closed - a bit of a detour but a wonderful one as it was not as crowded, had good trails (right on the PCT) a beautiful valley and the Drakesbad Guest Ranch is a fascinating historical spot (wonderful hot springs too). We did check out all the sites and some of the trail along the main tourist route S to N and camped at Summit Lake. Though it was July - there was a LOT of snow still around along the road which kept the temps cool, especially at night. This campground has small sites close together, many uneven for vehicles but is right on the lake and quite a beautiful spot. The park offers an amazing array of geology - of the ancient and recent (1914) volcanic kind. Good museum/info centre at the north entrance with helpful staff. A great National Park to spend some time in.","October 28, 2016",An Unexpected Gem,66,brisbane,5

We did not see any wildlife but the park features were the real stars here. Climbing Mt Lassen was a great hike and the views from the top were well worth it, Bumpass Hell was well worth the trek and was like a mini Yellowstone feature. We also enjoyed Cinder cone and the painted desert in the northeast corner of the park. All in all it was a great experience!

Mount Lassen,"This place was basically the Mount St. Helen of 100 years ago. So, it's interesting to see the devastation and regrowth. The drive is harrowing. The mountain is about 10,000 feet and you are up there (when driving) with no shoulders or guard rails. If we had come from the south, I would have made my husband turn around. No way I would have done it on the outer rim. This place also has thermal features similar to Yellowstone but on a smaller scale. There is one hike where you can go out to see mud pots etc., but it was just a bit too scary for me but many people were doing it. There is a large parking area where this hike starts so it is pretty obvious and it is also on the park map.For those less adventuresome, there are vents and mud pots further down the main road that you don't need to hike to. There is also a waterfall that is on the yellow sulphuric rock which is quite pretty. If we had had time, I would have liked to have walked along the Hat Creek with it on the nothern approach to the park.","October 18, 2016",Drive it going south only!!!,81,Fishkill,5

Do not be fooled by the warm temps at the trailhead in summertime. It gets very windy and cold from about midway to the top. I started with shorts and one thin summer shirt.

In the 70's, so good temp for some hikes! We stopped in Redding for some sandwiches so we could picnic along one of the lakes up there - just perfect. There is only one cafe inside the park on the south end, so bringing a lunch in is a good idea. We drove the main loop and did the Bumpass hike to the mud pots,etc. Well worth the hike. The sign says allow 2 hours, but took us 25 minutes in and 30 back up with addl time to take pics Etc. You could probably also do the Kings Falls hike in a half day.

We did the hike around the reflection lake to get great views of mount Lassen. Bumpass Hell is a nice hike although there is some elevation to cover. At Bumpass Hell there are wooden trails and platforms so that one can really get close to the hot springs and sulfur beds.

The view is spectacular and the feeling of accomplishment grand. The path is narrow at times - enough to fit 2 people. The top still had snow so we had a quick snowball fight. The temperature changes from hot due to activity to cold because the wind is cold. The wind is not on you all the time though. We had layers so easy enough to fix that.

Mount Lassen,"Spent the day driving the 30-mile highway and stopping at all the overlooks, viewpoints, and pull-outs along the way. We entered through the NW entrance and made our first stop at Loomis Museum. We enjoyed all the historical information (movie, pictures, and displays) regarding the area. Park Rangers were there to answer questions and provided additional info. It was small, but interesting.  Along the drive there were many spots to hike trails. This National Park is a hikers paradise. One of our members was in a wheelchair, however, so hiking trails was out of the question. The ONLY trail that was wheelchair accessible was the 1/2 mile trail in Devastated Area. This was a gravel path and it was easy to maneuver the chair. Although happy to have this trail wheelchair accessible, we were disappointed that there were not any others. Very bummed we were not able to hike Bumpass Hell. According to the park website, this IS the best trail to hike in the park. Unfortunately, we couldn't see it due to no wheelchair access. No view of the hydrothermal area from the parking lot either.The drive along Mt Lassen was very nice though and did provide lots of opportunities for turn outs and views. Some of the highlights were right along the road like Sulphur Works, Lake Helen, & Chaos Crags. We downloaded the ""auto tour"" so we had a nice audio of all the stops along the way. At the Kohm-Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center there were more displays and information regarding the mountain (and the same movie we saw at Loomis Museum). In addition, there was a small gift shop and café that served sandwiches and other items. We wanted to stop for lunch, but it was VERY crowded and HOT. Keep in mind both the museum and the visitor center is only open from 9 am - 5 pm. (both are wheelchair accessible!).","August 25, 2016",Beautiful,21,Oregon,5

Mount Lassen,"The Lassen Peak Trail has recently been rebuilt and is in excellent condition. A climb from approx. 8,500ft elevation at the trailhead to Lassen Peak at 10.457 ft over a trail length of about 2.5 miles took me (62 yro mobile marginally fit male) about 2.5 hrs to summit, taking plenty of rest stops to acclimate to the thinning air. The trail is a relatively consistent incline with a series of switchbacks. Great views along the way particularly as you near the peak. It was August when I was there and many many others were also making the climb but the trail provides plenty of room to accommodate all. I saw families, kids solo, older like me, fit and obviously unfit all making it to the top. Start early and take your time if need be. An unexpected delight were the thousands of butterflies near the peak. A nice area near the top (a false summit) perfect for lunch and to enjoy the view.

I am always amazed how it could be snow there when it is 85 degree out there :) The hike is a good exercise, especially due to the constant incline and and thin air and needless to say bring some sunscreen as there is no shade except for the very first section. The trail a bit narrow at certain sections so steady legs and no fear of heights are advisable.

Wow, what a place, total serenity, we just loved it, everything about it. We were travelling in an RV so stayed on the Visitor center car park which was fine, there are toilets available within the visitor center, which were very clean but we didn't need them. The sun was very hot here and you are quite elevated but we were used to that by the time we arrived, On our second day here we hiked up Lassen Peak, snow at the bottom and we crossed a couple of patches of snow on the way up but the rest of the track was just rock, lots of switch backs and an amazing summit. The views from the top were really wonderful and well worth going up for. Some hikers were skiing off as lots of deep snow still to come down on! Really enjoyed having a brew in the car park before heading back down to the visitors center and settling in for the night.

My children have studied earth science in school and this brought everything in their books to life. Carry water and jackets as it will be cool even though nearby Red Bluff and Redding will be baking in summer heat. Wear solid shoes as there are a lot of sharp rocks.

It was one of the coolest things I've ever seen. The drives were incredible. Even though I was driving for over 2 hours, it breezed by because every stretch was more gorgeous than the next. If you are in the area, you have to drive through Lassen Volcanic National Park.

I bought some books as well on the history of Mount Lassen. We had lunch at the cafe which was overpriced but hope the money goes to the park.

From Sulphur Works to Bumpass Hell to Boiling Springs Lake you can see the earth changing and reshaping right before your eyes. The landscape itself is absolutely stunning. There are many great opportunities to hike and camp throughout the park. Mount Lassen itself is a majestic sight which dominates the view through most of the park.

There were several areas with snow and hiking poles are essential when the snow turns to slippery-slush-over-ice in the afternoon. The wind was brutally cold, with sustained 30+ MPH winds throughout the hike and stronger gusts near the top. Hint: To find the brass USGS marker you must scramble through loose rocks about the size of bowling balls or larger. This is extremely dangerous for children who often put their hands on the rocks and heads down when climbing over bigger rocks. It may not seem that serious, but one loose 5 lb rock rolling down from someone higher up will break your ankle or leg.

Anywhere and any level of hike, you will find yourself surrounded by the wonderful restorative beauty of nature. Yesterday I hiked to Echo Lake for the first time. It is a 3.4mile ( round trip) trek. My friend's app let us know it was 12,000 plus steps and 53 stories ( going from roughly about 7000 to 7,500 ft elevation. ) The weather was perfect. Recommend starting early in the morning as it does get hotter in the afternoon. Bring water to stay well hydrated. The only thing I will do differently next time is pack a light lunch and spend more time at the lake for a break to enjoy lunch. We spend a good bit of time at Lake Almanor through the summer. It is only about half hour to Mt Lassen from there , so I'm looking forward to more hiking this summer , making it to the summit again and discovering more new trails. You will not be disappointed!

I wasn't able to go to the bigger one on the south end because it is WAY to close to the sulfur works.Parking for some of the hikes can be difficult. It's only on road parking for King Creek Falls so it can be hard to find an area to park. There was still snow there when we went.

Mount Lassen,"When a friend said - Lassen Volcanic National Park and Peak Lassen, I said - Come again? Where is that? I suppose people who live on the west coast are much more likely to have heard of Lassen but I had never before come across it. Peak Lassen is a volcano, still active (not smoking, but active) which erupted about 100 years ago. Lassen peak is 10,463 feet. It's about 2,000 feet climb from the base of the peak and 2.5 miles. I found the park a wonderful experience. Beautiful views. We visited for the 4th of July. The peaks still had snow. There are many lakes, which are also picturesque. The park is not overwhelmed with visitors. Far from it. And I really liked that. Some of our parks are too crowded, especially on holiday weekends. Lassen was a wonderful experience. You can experience the outdoors the way we love to experience it - away from the crowds and technology. BTW, no reception in the park or mostly no reception. Highly recommend the trails in the park, Devill's Kitchen, Boiling lake and Lassen Peak. I really enjoyed the peak climb. Wonderful views, good hike up. Definitely make a point to visit when in the area. Lovely views of Mt Shasta as well.","July 17, 2016",Great national park I had never heard of before,51,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mount Lassen,"Mount Lassen is the focal point of this hidden-gem-of-a-national park. Not many people are up for the 5-mile trek to the top where you start at 8,500 ft elevation and end at 10,000 ft elevation. We brought our three teenagers who are experienced backpackers and it was a challenging hike for us. I don't recommend taking young children or the elderly all the way to the top. If you plan to hike to the peak, here are some tips that I wish we had known beforehand:1. There's still snow in July!!! That means it's much colder on the mountain than in the rest of the park. Dress in layers, wear a jacket/windbreaker and bring a warm cap. Gloves help take the sting off from the high winds at the ridge near the top. 2. Wear proper hiking shoes. Don't attempt it in tennis shoes. Remember, there's a LOT of snow as you go up the mountain. In fact, the park recommends shoes with crampons to grip the snow. We also saw some people skiing down part of the mountain... in July!!!3. If you don't have crampons, bring a good set of hiking poles. These saved us as we navigated through dirt, snow, ice and slush on all the trails at Lassen. 4. Bring snacks and water. The hike takes about 5 hours roundtrip and you gain an elevation of 2000 feet through steep ascents and endless switchbacks. Rest often.5. Bring a camera for great photo ops. At times it seems you're above the clouds and the views are amazing! Take pictures along the way because there are often clouds at the top which can obscure the view.6.

Mount Lassen,"When visiting Shasta County make sure in take a trip up to lassen volcanic Park. Its a great drive up there and in easy drive around the mountain. You shouldn't have to worry about any altitude problems and certainly should enjoy the clean crisp air. There are wonderful hiking trails 4 everyone even though they may have a little challenge walking. When you check in to the park you'll receive a map of all the trails. Make sure you stop at the visitor center and read about the volcano and see the pictures of the eruption. Remember to look on your drive up that all the volcanic rocks that are so far from the mountain but were once part of the mountain. Bumpass Hell is a very popular spot to walk around and look at all the volcanic activity bubbling up in the form of steam pots. It is closed at this time but will reopen later in July or early August after all the ice has melted from the walkways. This is a ""don't-miss"" walk and anyone can do it.

Mount Lassen,"We arrived in the parking lot for the Lassen Peak hike around 8am, and there were very few people--for this reason I highly recommend going early in the morning (in the summer). The hike is strenuous, but the view from the summit is awesome. The hike up is mainly switchbacks and climbing uphill, but there are great views for pretty much the entire hike. I highly recommend this hike. Make sure you wear proper footwear!!! There is a lot of snow that we had to cross in the middle of July and it can be very slippery! On our way down, we saw a many people in average running shoes who were struggling on the slippery snow--not to mention the handful of people who were wearing Vans! Believe me, you will need good grip when there is a lot of snow on the trail. Of the several hikes we did while visiting Lassen Volcanic NP, this was by far the best. The panoramic view from the summit was totally worth the hard, strenuous climb to the top.","July 12, 2016",Amazing!,72,Oak Ridge,5

We we expressed our disappointment about the Bumpass trail being closed, she replied that we should have looked online.

Mount Lassen,"I've been to many national parks, but this park is so stunning. Thanks to El Niño, there was so much water and even snow in the higher elevations. Because of it's landscape, there is no driving loop. We entered from the north and ended in the south. There is very limited mobile phone signal. Some people were lucky at Kings Creek because they had Verizon. AT&T was available south of Manzanita Lake. It's great if you want the kids to not use their electronics.4WD is not necessary but recommended. And do not think that flip flops or sandals is appropriate anywhere. Make sure you being lots of bug repellant. Since there is a lot of water, you will find bugs. There are restrooms at campgrounds, but they are very basic and more like port-o-potties. Civilized bathrooms are found at both entrances. The weather was perfect at a high of 75. Certain areas were crowded, like Kings Creek and Sulphur Works. If you're not looking to hike, this park can be done in one day. If you're hiking, plan on a few days or one hike. Be aware the Kings Creek Falls trail is under construction, directing people to an alternate route. If you are not used to hiking or not willing to do a long hike, avoid the hike. The hike normally takes 1 hour, but we ended up hiking it for 2.5 hours. I would return, even with the $20 entrance fee.","July 3, 2016",Stunning!,53,"Monterey Park, California",5

Mount Lassen,"Due to the remote location of the park; you will not find many folks there, particularly on the week days. There are several great small lakes perfect for kayaking and catch and release; all amidst the grand views of the mountains. Mount Lassen will retain snow almost all year; and is a great place for kids to play for a cool treat during the summer. The mud pits always impress with their multicolored volcanic mud bubbling up. Great hikes on several trails leading to hidden lakes; streams; meadows; and mountain view unsurpassed in the US. Plan on seeing deer and possibly a bear or cougar as this is a remote area with plenty of wildlife. The Mount Lassen hike is taxing; however, after the climb to 10,200 ft you are rewarded with a view of Northern California mountains and forests that cannot be beat. Take lunch and eat at the top of the volcano. My grandkids; age 8 and 10 made it to the top of Mount Lassen and the trek is easily accomplished with a little patients and plenty of rest stops for kids.

Mount Lassen,"We took a drive north on a weekend trip, specifically to visit this park. Totally worth it! Absolutely fell in love with this park. We entered through the south entrance and didn't make it up the road all the way to the north entrance on either day that we visited, but that just gives us another reason to go back. The first day, we arrived around noon and were rewarded with mild weather and clear skies. We did the Bumpass Hell trail, which was challenging, but do-able for two horribly out of shape thirty somethings. The end of the trail was the reward, which was the field of fumaroles that you get to walk through on an elevated boardwalk. The second day, it was foggy and raining lightly when we got there around 10am. We hiked the short trail to the cold boiling lake, which unfortunately was not bubbling, only a little pond off to the side was, but it was still a beautiful sight regardless. It was an easy, short, 1mile roundtrip hike that was made even more lovely due to the light rain. It felt like we were the only people for miles. The park is filled with little wonders.

Mount Lassen,"I went for a day hike (Mount Lassen Peak) and it was a fantastic challenge. The route is easy to follow and there are tons of rocks to sit on for short water breaks. It became pretty steep at the top so prepare for a big workout. It wasn't an easy hike but considering I have weak lungs and Asthma, it was do-able and I had no issues breathing. Once you get to the top, you can hike a little higher up past the information stand. That is where you want to get a good picture. It is gorgeous up there!!! (See pic below). Some snow along the path and hot temperatures. If you're camping, you can purchase the permit in the front and they give you a map that helps a ton. There's an area called Devastated Area (forest?) and it's amazing seeing the damage from the last Lassen Eruption in the early 1900's. Scary seeing rows of burned trees but also beautiful. There are other hikes at this park as well. This is a must though, something to check off the bucketlist. Hike was over 5- 6 hours round trip (about 3 one way).

Mount Lassen,"Mount Lassen was made a national park in the early days of national park creation. At the time, the area was devastated by a tremendous volcanic explosion and it must've mesmerized visitors. Unfortunately, mother nature's healing hands cured the landscape and the trees really block the view of the mountain. The one area of interest and great for kids and adults is the Sulphur Works. It has hot mud, boiling mud pools and other hot gas vents. The rock colors are beautiful. Remember, its sulphur, so expect an unpleasant smell.

Even though the forest fire smoke covered most of the far views, it was still beautiful at the top. To my great surprise, and pleasure, there is a significant crater at top. I explored the crater for at least 45 minutes scrambling on the trails among the huge basalt boulders and few remaining snow drifts.

(We were almost running to our car...) but it's worth every breath! ","September 15, 2015",Wow!,41,"San Francisco, California",5
Mount Lassen,"One of the best national parks due to fewer visitors. The park has roughly 150 miles of hiking trails and geothermal activity. The hike up Lassen Peak is moderate, while the view from the top offers breathtaking vistas including Mount Shasta to the NW.","September 15, 2015",Go to Lassen National Park,23,Healdsburg,5
Mount Lassen,"At age 61, I was afraid I'd waited too long and wouldn't have the stamina for the trek to the top at this elevation, given that I live at sea level. But we spent a few days in the area doing other hikes and then started this one early in the morning when it was still cool. The trail is in fantastic shape after all the work the Park Service has done. It's wide and well groomed. The views get better and better on the way up, and there are bits of shade for about two-thirds of the way. Occasional mile markers let you know how far you have to go. At the top is a large flat area, easy to take in all the views. When we arrived, another hiker said ""This isn't the TRUE summit - it's over there"" (pointing). That bit is a scramble down a cowpath and up the rocks with no real trail, although the Park Service is working on it. It wasn't difficult but it also wasn't necessary.","September 14, 2015",I made it! You can too.,57,"Los Altos, California",5
Mount Lassen,"I wanted to tour Lassen Park ever since I went to Yellowstone a year ago and found the time this weekend. Visitors center at the south entrance was nice and staff were helpful, had a little café with snacks, sandwiches, and drinks along displays and mementos to purchase. The first geothermal feature is just a minute down the road and wasn't crowded. The road climbs the mountain as you pass a series of small lakes, trails and volcanic features where you can pull out and relax. When you reach the parking lot for the trail up to Lassen peak you are just below the summit and lots of hikers were climbing the trail from the parking lot at about 8500 feet to the summit about 2000 feet higher they looked like ants at the top but you could see them moving up there. You wind around to the east side of the peak and steadily lose elevation but pass by a series of campgrounds next to small high mountain lakes, we pulled through and they were quiet and relaxing. you pass through the devastation area from the1915 eruption as you go from the east side of Lassen to the northwest entrance to the park you end up at Manzanita lake where there's a museum, store, and campground which by far had the most people we'd seen all day. Over all I kind of missed the wildlife we'd seen at Yellowstone as we went there in the spring just as most of park was opening up and we only saw a couple of deer at Lassen right at Manzanita Lake, Also I was surprised at how quickly we went from one end of the park to the other and wished they would connect the roads that go into the Southeast and Northeast parts of the park to get to those areas you have to drive a long way outside the park and then come back in to roads that dead end inside the park. My understanding is that a lot more of the active geothermal features are in the east side of the park.","September 14, 2015",Quiet and beautiful,13,Sacramento,4

Mount Lassen,"My first stop on my first to the park was the visitor center restroom that looked like ****. Best sites if you are just touring the road are the Sulphur Works and views of Mt. Lassen. The bubbling sulphur pit was the best one I have ever seen, topping Yellowstone in my opinion--but that is just one spot in the park versus other more famous parks that have lots of awe-inspiring places.","September 6, 2015","Fairly remote, went once, will likely not go again.",56,Seymour,4
Mount Lassen,"The thought of hiking to the top of a major volcano was intriguing to me. This is an awesome hike to accomplish. 5 miles RT with about 1900 feet in elevation gain. A bit of a puffer, but the payoff is worth it. The NPS has done a great job the last few summers to repair the trail. Very popular. About halfway up there was a trail crew working on some minor details. The trail itself is not really steep, but going up on the switchbacks constantly with the high elevation, it can present a challenge. If you're going uphill against the wind like I did, it's even tougher. Plenty of interpretive signs and areas to stop and take a break if needed. There are more signs at the first summit. From here, the views are endless. Cinder Cone, Lake Almanor, Mount Shasta to name a few. To get to the true top, it does require a rock scramble and that's where it can get tricky. Some of the rocks are loose, but if you navigate it right, you'll make it. Lassen is a plug dome volcano and you get a great view of the center of the volcano from here. You do get a top of the world feeling from here. Of course the trek down doesn't take as long. Allow about 2 hours to go up and an hour or so on the way down. This is a very rewarding hike and if you enjoy doing hikes like this, this one is a must.","September 5, 2015","Top Of Lassen, Awesome!",403,"Lynnwood, Washington",5
Mount Lassen,"Although this isn't the most beautiful of national parks, it is still lovely. I would recommend two days to hike some of the best trails. My favorite was Bumpass Hell which has a fairly steep return in its earliest section. Bring plenty of water. The park has no gas station, lots of campsites, but not much by way of food...mainly overpriced sandwiches and drinks. Come with a full ice chest.","August 29, 2015",Small park but lovely,146,California,4
Mount Lassen,"To really appreciate and enjoy Lassen Volcanic National Park it pays to get away from the road and the popular trails. Bumpass Hell is very interesting and the climb up the Peak is well worth the effort, especially since the trail has been repaired and improved, but there is so much more. The Brokeoff Trail is one of my favorites and the backpacking along trails to the east of the highway is excellent. Seeing the best parts of this Park require some effort and planning but the reward is beauty and solitude. If you don't have much time then at least view the excellent film at the Visitor's Center near the south entrance and the Loomis Museum near the north entrance.Do remember that in normal years the Park receives a lot of snow and in some exceptional years the road may be closed until late June or even into July because of the challenge of removing the huge amounts of snow.This year-2015- there was not a lot of snow but late-Spring and early-summer rains meant that the wildflower display was spectacular.","August 26, 2015",A Gem of a National Park,8,"Houston, Texas",5

The story about how our 17th National Park came to be is fascinating. We were there on a crystal clear morning, and left with our heads full of magnificent vistas There are many pull-offs for viewing. We could see a couple of forest fires smoking in the distance.

It is a pleasant drive with many sights along the way such as small lakes, as well as having a number of picnic areas.  The large visitor center is well stocked; there is a café; and there is an informative video as well as displays that explain the history and geology of the park.

Mount Lassen,"Although it isn't as showy--or as popular--as Yellowstone, Lassen has many of the same features: geysers, mud pots, steam vents, and wildlife. It also has hiking trails, a mountain to climb with views of much of northern California from its summit, and winter sports such as skiing and show-shoeing. It's a great place to go for a day or a week. Climb Lassen, hike Bumpass Hell, camp near a mountain lake, or just enjoy a pleasant drive-through.

Mount Lassen,"One of the least visited of the nation's National Parks. A smaller version of Yellowstone. Not nearly as crowded as Yosemite. The Park is volcanic, last eruption occurring 1914-1915. Lots of vents, mud pots, hot lakes and creeks, wildlife, hiking trails, visitor centres South (preferred) and North, a camper store at Manzanita Lake and the Loomis Museum which chronicles the last eruptions. $20 entry fee, a 35 MPH speed limit on the well paved and maintained road, scenery is stunning throughout. Visitor Center in the south shows a very informative film (20 min.) has a Gift Shop and a Restaurant. The northern Visitor Center does not. The total drive through the Park is about 45 miles. There are over 100 hiking trails in the Park, some of which are disabled friendly. Some trails are for horseback riding, stables are available. When you do get to the trailhead to ascend the mountain, you will be at 8500 feet altitude. There will be a 2000 foot rise as you hike the 2.5 mile hike to the top. It should go without saying that you should dress in layers, carry a waterproof, and wear sunscreen and sturdy shoes! Bring water with you in sufficient quantity. As great as the vistas are all over the Park, the 360-degree view from the Summit of Lassen are simply beyond description. Enjoy!

Mount Lassen,"One warm sunny California morning in June, as we were driving from Reno to the California coast, we decided to pay a visit to Lassen Volcanic National Park. We enjoy visiting national parks, but had heard little to nothing about Mount Lassen. We arrived at the park entrance and to our dismay, the park was temporarily closed due to an overnight snowfall of close to 4 inches. Snowfall? We were shocked. We stopped by a rest area next to a lake and enjoyed some sandwiches we had packed. A park ranger said the park would likely open around 1030 AM or so, after they finished clearing the roads. We were at the gate before 11, not realizing how much the memories from the rest of this day would stay with us. The fresh snow, the breathtaking scenery, deer walking cautiously beside our car near a cliff, standing beside 30 ft. hight piles of snow from the snow plows, where we parked at the visitor's center, following some animal trails into dry snowless areas amoungst the pine trees, the afternoon snowball battle as temps got near 60, serene mountain lakes, chipmunks taking cherries from our hands along a ridge, fantastic pictures right from our car window... I could go on, but I'm sure you'll find many adventures of your own, if you decide to make the trek. We relaxed beside another lake on the other side of the park that late afternoon, treasuring a day - well spent!","August 14, 2015","Escape to God's country, excellent scenery, challanging hikes, or simply enjoy from your vehicle!",27,"York, Pennsylvania",5
Mount Lassen,"I hadn't been here in over 35 years so it was a delight to see how well it has been maintained. The visitor center really explains it well and is well laid out with food and the usual things. The display on different volcano types is perfect for educating kid as well as adults. The rangers are helpful too. The mountain has almost no snow thanks to 5 years of drought, but is still impressive. Bumpass Hell has great thermal action and the mud pots were so active they shut them down the day after we were there. Good sign that nature is still alive and kicking. NO CROWDS! beautiful drive in through and out of park. Lake Helen in my favorite with incredible clarity, and hues of blue and green. There is a hiking path to the summit. But is quite a challenge due to altitude, although saw many people heading up and coming back not exhausted.

Mount Lassen,"A must-see is the Bumpass Hell thermal area. In the old days, you could simply walk around with your foot punching through the crust into the hot sulfur below. Sadly, it is now all boardwalk, so your boy children will be somewhat disappointed (but your car won't smell like sulfur all the way home). If you plot out your route on the map, you will discover you can begin your hike at the Bumpass Hell parking area, pass through Bumpass Hell, and continue on to the Kings Creek camping and picnic area. If you park there and hitchhike to the Bumpass Hell parking area to begin your walk, you will find it is all downhill.The hidden gem at Lassen is Butte Lake and the Cinder Cone. Largely ignored by visitors, Butte Lake is a great campground with genuine flush toilets and a ranger on duty. Butte Lake itself is wonderful for canoeing, and Bathtub Lake, a block or so from the campground, is as hot as a bathtub. The Cinder Cone (Google it) is just shy of 1000 feet, but you'll have to climb 1500 feet to get to the top of it because you slip back a third of the way with every step in the loose cinders. You'll feel a real sense of accomplishment at the top, and the view of the painted Fantastic Lava Beds is a sight to behold. I first climbed it when I was eight years old as did my kids, so don't worry about little people making it to the top. Much more approachable than Lassen Peak, and more enjoyable as well.Butte Lake and the Cinder Cone are in the Northeast section of the park. To get there, you must exit the park at the north and drive for a half hour or so east. The road into Butte Lake is gravel, though they grade it every 50 years or so to keep it nice and smooth :-). Be prepared for a good long rumble on the drive in, secure in the knowledge it's keeping all but the most adventurous out.I've had to put down a specific date and sort for a visit, but I've been coming to Lassen at least every five years since 1953, as a kid, a couple, with friends, and with family. Every visit has been fun and memorable.Try to plan your visit for the summer months. Lassen Park starts getting cold in September and tends to stay that way through May. In many campgrounds, you can still find snow to keep your food chilly well into August, though it is warm and comfortable during the day.","August 10, 2015",Dormant volcano with many of Yellowstone's attractions with a lot less driving between,55,USA,5

The following day we were dazzled by rangers, volunteers and an ornothologist, Ryan tagging songbirds. Precious songbirds are captured by a net, tagged, recorded and released.

Cinder Cones, plug domes like Mt Lassen, ones, worn down ones, known as erosional, and shield volcanoes. (John forgets the scientific names). Mt. Lassen last blew its top exactly 100 years ago so you can see lava flows everywhere, cooled off, mostly.

It is as beautiful as many other parks - volcanic activity, substantial mountain peaks, high passes, good accommodations and support from the National Park Service.

Mount Lassen,"In 1914 when Mount Lassen began erupting, local business man and amateur photographer, B.F. Loomis grabbed his gear and recorded the volcano’s major eruptions during 1914 and 1915 as well as the devastation afterwards. Being the first major volcanic eruption in the contiguous United States and the first volcanic eruption anywhere to be captured in both photographs and motion pictures, the Mount Lassen captured the fascination of the American public and Mr. Loomis championed the formation of a national park which became reality on August 9, 1916. Today, Mount Lassen rises to the height of 10,462 feet (3,189m) and dominates the beautiful national park consisting of alpine lakes, evergreen forests and hydrothermal features that, despite its beauty and diversity, is one of the least visited. However, the park’s low rate of visitation does make it particularly special for those that do venture here as one can have most of Lassen’s many wonderful, unspoiled trails virtually to themselves, including the strenuous 5.0 mile (8.1k) roundtrip hike to the top of Mount Lassen. While the trail to the top has been closed much of the last few years for rehabilitation, the work is now complete and the trail is open. If hiking is not for you, the park offers a scenic drive that arcs around Mount Lassen with many pullouts to enjoy the features of the park and is just the right length for a wonderful day visit.","February 13, 2015",A Volcano that Created a National Park,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

My son and I had always wanted to take the trail to the top of Mount Lassen but, unfortunately, the trail was closed for the final year of the multi-year trail rehabilitation project. Nevertheless there were plenty of other trails to enjoy in Lassen Volcanic, many with the peak of Mount Lassen in view. Now that the restoration is compete, perhaps someday we will have the opportunity to return and reach the summit.","February 12, 2015",Trail to the Top Was Closed – Now Open,3757,"Avon, Ohio",4

Because we were in the area we decided to visit on 5th November, signs on the road leading to the park said it was closed as did signs at the entrance to the park. We went to the visitor centre where after asking a ranger how far we could go in the park he said it was open, when we pointed out that all the signs, the website and the answerphone still said the park was closed he said they had n't been updated! When we asked about some of the trails to areas of volcanic activity he said we could visit these but all the direction signs had been taken down.

You can see a lot from the turnouts in the road, but a lot more can be seen if you like to hike. This would be a great place to go camping. At the entrance and the visitors center we were told to go to Bumpass Hell and that the trail was fairly level except for the end where there were a few steps down to the mudpots. That was mostly true except that the few steps were actually a few switchbacks. Go in the fall when the temperatures are perfect.","November 16, 2014",Better if you are a hiker,7,"Torrance, California",4

Unlike so many other parks which have one set of expectations, Lassen has many: sulfer pots and the badlands, alpine peaks, mountain ranges, valleys, meadows and sub-desert conditions. Add to this natural wonder the fact that traffic into the park is nominal and you have nature without the crazy crowds. So many others have provided detail on what to see and points of interest, so I will day ditto.

The snow was extremely deep and impassable, but it made for some magnificent scenery. When we returned this summer, the park roads were passable, though I think the Bumpass Trail was closed due to snow. Along the main road are awesome views of ice lakes with such a deep blue, it’ll take your breath away and fantastic mountain vistas. If you love the National Parks like we do, put this on your list.

Mount Lassen,"The Lassen Peak trail is moderately steep and as of September 2014 is undergoing significant trail maintenance. The top half of the trail is closed so you can only hike the first 1.3 miles, which is about half way up. Beyond that the trail is closed and upon observation from the closure point it looks much steeper than the first part – in fact the part we could see was mostly stone steps.As you hike up the part that is open, you may be sharing the trail with construction crews who are re-contouring some of the switchback corners with new stone work and adding platform areas where you can step off the trail for a breather without blocking the passage of others. They will be carting boulders up the trail in motorized carts that they walk behind. Whenever a hiker approaches they stop the cart and shut off the engine till you pass so it’s not a big deal other than the noise of the motors.Anyway, the trail portion that is open is well worn and plenty wide enough for two way traffic without the need for someone to step aside. The trail is mostly sunny but there are a few spots that have a bit of shade in small patches. On the end of the section that is currently open for hiking there are some big rocks with flat tops for sitting and taking in the view for awhile. If you started your hike in the morning (say between 9:00 and 11:00), this is good place to eat that lunch you had the foresight to bring along with you. Of course it goes without saying that you also brought drinking water as you would on any such hike.The open section of trail is for the most part on the western slope – something to consider on warm days. On the way up you get great views to the west where you can see Helen Lake, Lake, Mt. Diller, Pilot Pinnacle, Broke off mountain and off into the western distance. You will also have great views to the south where you’ll be able to see Lake Almanor and a series of ridges and valley’s off into the distance.Unless it’s a cool day, start early to avoid mid day heat. Having said that, even if it’s warm at the parking lot trail head, it may be cool (or cold) higher up. When we hiked all the way to the top a few decades ago it was quite chilly on top – even though it was late August and quite warm at the parking lot. In fact our kids had a snowball fight up there. The section of trail currently open for use ascends at a moderate angle pretty much continually (no ups and downs --- just up). I’m 66 years old (how the heck did that happen?), and a bit overweight (I know how that happened), and my wife is 63 and has an artificial knee. I’m a photographer so I make many stops on the way up and down to set up the tripod and take some shots. Given all of that, we did the entire round trip (including a picnic lunch at the end of the open section, in a bit over 3 hours.If you found this information useful in your decision making process, you gleaned information you may not have otherwise discovered, or you just enjoyed reading it and appreciate the time I put into writing it, please give me a ""helpful"" vote.

We enjoy visiting National Parks and the 30-mile Lassen Volcanic Natioal Park Highway offered a excellent introduction to the park.For a more in-depth auto-tour, pick up the Road Guide at the visitor center.The Roads though the park are very good. We learned that four types of volcanoes found in the entire world are in Lassen Volcanic National Park. That include a Shield, Lassen Peak a plug dome, cinder cone and composite volcanoes. The road guide auto-tour from the visitor center will point these out. We enjoyed the beautiful views of Lake Helen at the base of Lassen Peak. Nice place to picnic.And the views of Lassen Peak from the highest point on the park road, 8,512ft. As a light snow flurry came though. The Sulphur Works are very easy to reach. Just walk along a sidewalk from a near by parking area to the steam vents and bubbling mudpot.

Mount Lassen,"You have to take the hike to Bumpass Hell. The trail is a 3 mile loop. On the weekends, the parking lot can get full, but don't fret, you can park on the side of the road. I suggest that you park down the hill next to Lake Helen and walk up the slope that leads to the trail. This will save you at least 5-10 minutes compared to starting at the parking lot. It took me about 40-45 minutes to get to the bottom. You can actually hear the steam vents hissing as you come around the corner and look down. The side of the mountain is a different color and you know you've arrived. The last leg of the trail is a steep incline so make sure you have on good shoes so that you don't slip. Although, I've seen some people hiking down with sandals. I don't recommend this as the sharp rocks can give you a nice cut. Once you arrive at the bottom, there is a boardwalk that takes you to different parts. There is actually a nice little pond at the end of the boardwalk that was very clear and quite a bit of a surprise. I did not expect to see that there. Don't carry too much and make sure you bring a towel with you as you are going to need it to wipe the sweat off your body when you make the trip back out. That was the hardest part of the hike, but definitely well worth it. Keep in mind that the trail will take you about 2.5-3hrs roundtrip. So prepare for that when you are planning on hitting up other sites.","September 3, 2014",Bumpass Hell is worth the hike,43,"Los Angeles, California",5

Buy the guidebook at the visitor center if you plan to drive through the park, but be aware that the some of the stops are not well-marked. If you want to hike, probably best to allow 2 days here. Just hiking to Kings Creek Falls is ~3 mi round-trip suitable for moderate-level hikers. Honestly, you're better off seeing Burney Falls at McArthur-Burney State Park not far from here, especially in a drought year. We didn't have time to hike another ~3 mi into Bumpass' Hell and back.

I was pleasantly surprised with the geyser basin. I set low expectations, having been to Yellowstone many times, but Lassen has its own unique beauty and the lack of crowds made it even more enjoyable! Worth a visit!

Mount Lassen,"Start at the south visitor center (turnoff at Route 36), which has full restroom facilities, a nice cafe, gift shop, and most important an excellent informative video about the park and its geological history. There you can buy the auto self-tour guidebook for about $6.50 plus tax. It provides info on the 16 numbered points of interest along the road, as well as walking/hiking trails. The guidebook is also sold at the north visitor center (turnoff at Route 44), but they don't have a cafe nor do they show the video, and I'm not sure if their restrooms are just the chemical kind. The visitor centers are open 9-5 daily in summer. If you allow a full day or more, you can enjoy various scheduled ranger talks, see the museum at the north visitor center, and see a lot more of the park, even by just following the short walking trails.Inside the park there are camping facilities at Drakesbad and at Manzanita Lake, but they are often booked up far ahead. Outside the park are other campgrounds, bed & breakfast inns, etc.There's only one road through the park (Route 89) and it's closed in winter, although the south visitor center has limited hours and the park is still open for hiking, snowmobiling, XC skiing, etc. The road is about 45 miles long, steep and winding, and the speed limit is 35 (slower on the many sharp curves), so if you didn't stop at any points of interest it would still take a couple of hours. Doing the drive from south to north is best, but either way is definitely worth it. You should definitely plan to stop and read the informative plaques even if you are not up for hiking.Highly recommended for everyone with even the slightest interest in volcanoes!","August 19, 2014","Fascinating, little traveled",105,"Norwalk, CT",4

Mount Lassen,"Make sure before you go, to check out if access to the top is available. They are doing a major renovation project and access to the top of the peak is limited to public access only about once per month. We made sure our trip was planned on one of those weekends. Awesome hike up. CCC were busy working on the trail rock walls. Got an early start around 9am and already many people hiking. If you are not in good shape expect to suffer a bit. Its not a hike for those that arent in decent shape. Yes, you can take your time hiking this but the longer it takes, the longer you are in the sun as there is NO shade, thus the early hike time. Also, for most people this high elevation will make for some heavy breathing if you are not in shape for this. I saw many groups of people that should not have been attempting this hike. I saw a group of adults hauling up small, young children that were literally crying as their parents kept urging them on. Really consider your fitness level before attempting this hike. My husband and I in our early 50's hike in WA state all the time on mountains like this so this hike was a cake walk for us. Made the summit in less than an hour and even faster coming down. Not much in terms of views. The sky was very hazy in the distance esp North towards Shasta. Everyday we were in the park there was a heavy haze over the mountain ranges. Still, this is a classic hike in this awesome park and if you are able to do it, its a must do hike.","August 10, 2014",Its open!,44,washington,5

Next day had a early start up Lassen peak as it was open to the public this weekend to the top. Go early to avoid the crowds and heat. Beautiful breeze the whole way up. Hiked Cold Boiling Lake to Bumpass Hell to avoid the crowds and have better views and then hiked back. Beautiful vistas of the lakes below. Headed back at the end of the day and sat on the tables i the back of the visitor center and had refreshments/snacks before heading back to Mineral to our lodging.

Mount Lassen,"I liked absolutely EVERYTHING about the park. Did not climb Lassen, the trail was not open to the top, which was a lucky excuse for me. For amazing volcanic feature, the Bumpass Hell trail is the one to do. Moderately strenuous for those who are sensitive to altitude, but doable for families. The reward is worth every huff and puff. Fumeroles and mud pots. Words don't do it justice. My favorite hike was to Paradise Meadow. A bit of a climb, but again, doable if you go slow and steady. What you get while hiking? Spectacular cataracts which had a good amount of water flowing even in the middle of a dry summer. What you get when you reach the top? Indescribable. Breathtaking doesn't do Paradise Valley justice. It may be the most beautiful sight I have ever witnessed, and I have been many beautiful places. This is a must do hike. For people with strollers or very small kids, try the Summit Lake or Manzanita Lake hikes. Both are completely flat, and can be accomplished under 2 hours. Nice places for picnics as well. Summit Lake has fewer people. There is also a nice little hike around the Lily Pond, right across from Manzanita Lake and the NE Visitor Center. Lily Pond has far fewer people than Manzanita Lake, and there is a guide telling you about what trees you are viewing on your hike. Almost anywhere you choose to hike, you will be able to see Lassen Peak, which is darned cool. If you are on the fence about going to Lassen, get off the fence and go. You won't be disappointed.

Mount Lassen,"Only in California can you go from the cold north Atlantic Ocean to mountains 8000 feet in elevation the same day. I started near Crescent City at Redwood National Park among old grove majestic redwoods. Less than 6 hours later, I was at Lassen. Because of the heat (in the 90s), I decided to skip most of the hiking for one trail, the Bumpass Hell trail. It was 3 miles round trip, but felt like more. Believe me, carry water like the signs say. I am fairly fit but I was wiped out by the time I returned to the car. The heat, the elevation, they got to me. But if you can only do one trail, do that one, You can see the boiling pools and mud pots, view the steam, smell the rotten egg sulfur odor, get the volcano experience. I drove to the base of the summit trail, but it was closed and I didn't have time anyway. Lassen is tricky because the roads and trails are closed with snow much of the year, except for late summer and then it is hot. So you pretty much need to get there in late summer and early fall if you want to add Lassen to your national parks bucket list.I'd like to come back sometime and camp for a couple nights so I can do several of the trails.

Mount Lassen,"I did this hike in early July. Still some snow on the trail right near the top and some drifts alongside the trail in spots. Started early in the morning (7am), the sun gets hot at that elevation and there is little shade on the trail as it faces to the south. Bring sunscreen! Early start means you beat the crowds. There is a big parking lot right at the trailhead. It’s about 6 miles in from the south gate. The trail is easy to follow, never very steep. The only part that would be any concern is the last 200 feet or so. When you get to the (almost) top there is a flat area, as you continue across the ridge you then go up some loose rocks/gravel. It not too much but just be careful of people hiking above you, there could be some rock fall. I’m in fairly good shape (47 years old) and it took me an 1 ½ hours to get to the top. Just a few stops for some photos. I spent a half hour up there and then took 45 minutes to get down. Parking lot is at elevation 8,500 and you climb to 10,463 feet. 9th highest summit in the entire Cascade Range. It’s a good hike to do for a first timer at elevation.

Mount Lassen,"This National Park Is Amazing. So that being said most national parks are. We drove into the north entrance just coming from Lava Bed State Park. We wanted to get to Chester for the night.Once in the park we were speechless on how beautiful everything is. The drive through the parkwas fantastic. We stopped to take some pictures, then realized we needed to extend our vacation one more day. So we did, and came back the next day for some adventures and hiking. First hike of the day was Bumpass Hell, Geothermal Pools. WoW this place is amazing. we left early so we had the whole place to out selves, the hike is beautiful, it was a crisp 46 degrees so the steam was pronounced. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Next was Mill Creek Falls. this hike was a little harder then Bumpass Hell but in part we had been hiking for a week. Once again beautiful hike beautiful water falls.

The park is gorgeous, and under appreciated we thought. Make sure you see the 20 minute movie in the visitor's lodge that tells about the history of the park.

Mount Lassen,"We did a last minute weekend trip up to Lake Almanor/Mt. Lassen National Park in mid-June. Our only regret was not being able to spend more time at the park. We arrived there Sunday morning, did a quick hike into Bumpass Hell then finished driving the loop around the park before heading home in the Bay Area. It was our first experience to this park, I think this park deserves much more merits because it has been overshadowed by the nearby Yosemite or even Lake Tahoe areas. But maybe that's good for us so we don't get too many gawking tourists. :-)The park is in a dormant volcano area. The scenic is breathtaking and there's something for both the geological geeks to explore or us mere curious observers to wonder. There were mud pots, steam vents, and ""geyser"" but even if you don't see any of those, the beauty of the park and the surrounding area is enough to make you dizzy. We'll definitely be back so we can get to know it better. But if you have a day or two, it's well worth your time to explore this park.","June 30, 2014",Not to be missed!,12,"San Ramon, California",5

Mount Lassen,"Not at the top of the list of National Parks you'd think of in California, but definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. There's not much else around for many miles so making a trip just to come here would only be practical if you were planning to spend some time camping and hiking. We had planned for neither as were were enroute from Crater Lake OR to the SF Bay area to visit family. As a result, ours was a simple day trip over from our campsite in McCloud. Had hoped to find more geothermal areas either near the road or closer in terms of hikes - we're southerners and the altitude does a number on us when hiking these mountain areas with altitude. Were able to do a shorter hike and of course saw the Sulpher Works area along the road. (note: if you have been here in the past and walked the boardwalk a the Sulphur Works area this boardwalk has been closed and removed. you can now only see a single geothermal vent on the southside of the visible hill near the parking area and a combo vent and boiling pool at the front of the sidewalk/road.still cool up here, there was a good bit of snow still on the ground in some areas and we enjoyed watching a couple van loads of kids from some kind of school or church group play in the snow and pelt each other with snowballs.beautiful and glad we made the trip over to see it - would i make another effort and come back? probably not unless i specifically put it on a hiking trip agenda and train in some higher altitude.","June 11, 2014",Worth the time when in the area,160,"Canton, Georgia",4
Mount Lassen,"I have a very short list of the best outdoor places to visit in California. First are the redwoods, then comes Yosemite, Mount Lassen, Lake Tahoe and Mt Shasta.This last weekend my daughter and I wanted to get away from it all. She just finished school for the year and we wanted to get to someplace spectacular quickly. We could have gone to any place on the short list except Yosemite, because we didn't have reservations. So we chose Mount Lassen National Park. Cost to enter the park is $10.00.We stayed at Manzanita Lake which has the largest campground in the park. We had fun and took some great photos as we walked around the lake. Travel time around the lake is about 1 hour 10 minutes with breaks and plenty of time for pictures. The campgrounds were clean and well maintained. Cost per night at this campground is $18.00. Showers avail $$$ (other campgrounds in the park are less costly but more primitive. Each camp site comes with it's very own steel food locker to keep the bears away from your food.We traveled through the park on a well maintained road with many pull outs and plenty of trails to explore. Most of the trail systems in the park are open, but the trail to Bumpass Hell was still snowed in. Park Rangers informed us all trails would be open by mid July.If your interested in volcanoes, steam vents, fumaroles, and bubbling hot sulfur springs, this is one great outdoors area you must check out.Happy traveling!","June 9, 2014",The best of the great outdoors,43,"Paradise, California",5
Mount Lassen,"I was 53 years old when I hiked to the top of Mount Lassen. I love it at the top of mountains like this. The views are absolutely awesome! This hike was more of a grunt than the hike up Broke-Off Mountain, but still not bad at all. For me, the worst of it was nowhere to stop and pee! I never got to go until we made it to the top and I found a spot in the rocks.","June 8, 2014",Awesome View from the Top,88,"Grants Pass, Oregon",5
Mount Lassen,"As with all national Parks, this obviously would deserve five stars. However, with that said, it is far out of the way of anything. Certainly not as majestic as Yosemite Park, this park is worth a visit if you are in the area. I am glad I visited, but it's really just a lot of driving and one boiling mud pit towards the end of the park entrance as far as ""cool volcanic activity"" goes! The volcano is very pretty to look at for a few. The good trails are closed most of the year due to snow. If you're really here to see boiling mud and volcanic geological stuff, make sure the Bumpass trail is open. otherwise you will be highly disappointed.All in all, a nice place to visit.","June 6, 2014",Ok place,829,"Beverly Hills, California",4
Mount Lassen,"My girlfriend and I spent a half day hiking and checking out the north west part of the park. Because it still has a lot of snow on the roads the park is not completely open in early May but there is quite a bit to see and do. We hiked around a couple of lakes and didn't see another person on the trails (this is a plus). We had blue skies and then snow flurries…but no real bad weather and nothing to dampen our outdoor experience. You can drive in about 10 miles and then the road is closed w/ a locked gate. In late May the park will be completely open and the crowds will start showing up. I've hiked Mt Lassen to the summit before and its an easy trek kids, families and any one of any age who is in reasonably good physical condition can successfully complete. Be forewarned however, the park is doing their second year of trail work on the summit trail and they have a very restricted schedule for opening the trail to hiking all the way to the peak so check the website before visiting if you plan on making this epic (but easy) hike. There are plenty of campsites but reservations are a good idea as the first-come-first-serve camp sites are gone quickly.","May 12, 2014",Lots To See,86,"Eureka, California",4

I have to say I was surprised by how much this NP has to offer. It has excellent hiking mountains, excellent camping facilities, and interesting geology. I thoroughly enjoyed my hike up Broke Off Mountain. The views from the top are impressive and it's not very crowded. The fumaroles reminded me of Yellowstone and the views of the night sky can't be beat. Arrive in time for the Persied Meteor Showers-you will not be disappointed.

It is worth it at the end of it. This is like a small preview of Yellow stone . If you have already been to yellowstone then this wont be too much exciting.Lake manzanita - it is a pretty lake view to sit by and have a barbecue party.The lake itself looked very dirty.

Mount Lassen,"How do you hide a mountain, or should I say an active volcano. It is really not well known even in California, being near no major freeway. When we take people up the winding road of Highway 32 (off Hwy 99 at Chico), you drive some 45 miles of scenic wilderness delight to left on Highway 36 (PS have a full gas tank in Chico and get a picnic lunch), then another 20 minutes to the entrance of the Park, then you really learn what the words ""winding road"" means once inside the park. But every turn just gets better and better.Geologically Mount Lassen is at the end of the Cascade range and on the way up Highways 32 and 36 as I described you wind in and out of the Cascade and the start of the Sierra Nevada range. That is a delightful trip in itself with creeks and dramatic views sprinkled throughout.Once in the park you will run into breath taking views that remind me of Zermatt Switzerland except for the numerous hot springs, volcanic vents, mud pots and even green boiling lakes that thunder under your feet. The Alpine heights are unbelievable. For the moderately fit you can even climb to the top of Lassen for a view that will knock your socks off. Coming the route I described you will go through the Main entrance that has a brand new interpretive center that is worth a orientation visit, then head up to Bumpass Hell, various other hot spots and views that have easy parking. For those who want to get away from the crowds go to the small town of Chester, head towards Drakesbad to reach a little used entrance to the park. There you can see Devils Kitchen or another route to cold boiling lakes that make you think your on a set for a David Bowie Space video the landscape is so alien as the ground shakes under your feet. Bring plenty of water and lunch folks for these hikes.Lots of car camping to rugged hiker camping - you get a pretty good map when you enter into the park. Limited services at Main Entrance but more full service, camp store at Manzanita Lake when you almost complete the drive.This is backpacking heaven for the fit- I have taken many scout groups on a Lassen to Lassen Hike from the top of Mount Lassen to Butte Meadows Camp Lassen 60 miles way. If you study the maps you can hit many major areas from various entrance points with a all wheel drive vehicle highly suggested, a little hiking, not be with the crowd and be busy for a week or more.Oh and be ready to speak German, they just love this park.","February 14, 2014",A Hidden Worldwide Attraction in Northern California,199,"Chico, California",5
Mount Lassen,"I hiked Mt. Lassen in mid-October, just before the trail was closed for the winter and couldn't have picked a better time. At the southern end of the Cascade Range, the 10,457 ft peak was the last to erupt in California in May, 1915. It has unimpeded views to Mt. Shasta, 70+ miles NW and the Sierra Nevada, 125 miles SE. The small amount of snow on the ground (little on exposed ground, 4' in drifts) only added to the beauty of the hike. The snow capped peaks and sapphire lakes in all directions shown in the crystal air. The entire park, and surrounding country, are a jumble of forested slopes and shadowed valleys.Notes: The trail is well tended and good for all until just below the peak, but it would be exposed, hot and dry in the summer, With snow, trekking poles would be helpful.","December 29, 2013",Last active volcano in California offers magnificent vistas,24,California,5

I have to admit I wasn't so sure that I wanted to take the time to make a stop since it was a little bit out of the way to go there but my husband was insistent that we go and I am so glad that he was! This park had so much more to offer than I ever imagined. We just did a drive through but took our time to walk around (there are some very easy educational walks on paved surfaces). The mountain was beautiful...some of the lakes were still frozen but beautiful. This may have been a lower snow total year but there was still plenty of it at the end of May!

Mount Lassen,We were there for 4 days. There were so many hikes you can go on no matter what level of hiking you are at. I was surprised that there were mud pools and hot springs like what you seen at Yellowstone. When we were there the sky was so clear and you could see what seemed forever. The hike to Bumpass Hell was worth the 3 miles. They were just starting to shut down campgrounds for the season so we were limited as to where we could stay. It was the South something campground. North was closed. The spaces are small and asphalt is in bad shape. On our last day we hiked the Manzanita Lake trail. Make sure to start the trail behind the museum. The trail is better defined there. We went a different direction near the boat ramp and it was hard to follow at times. We stayed close to the water and found our way back to the main trail. I took some amazing pictures of the mtn with the lake and water fowl. It was only 10.00 to get into the park for a week. We want to go back but take our motorcycle next time because the views are so amazing. Also many more hikes we didn't have time to do.

Mount Lassen,"My family went camping at Lassen VNP at the first week of August. We enjoyed the scenic volcanic view, several beautiful lakes and the not too hot weather. We arrived a Friday afternoon and the Manzanita Lake camp site was full. We moved on to the next camp site - Crags Camp. We found a good spot under the trees. Cool at night. Make sure you bring your jacket. Comparing to Yosemite, the highway to Lassen VNP is straight and flat.Day 1: Arrived Crags Camp and set up tent.Day 2: Drove outside Lassen VNP. Visited Subway Cave at Lassen National Forest (15 min drive from Lassen, a easy flat highway). Then drove another 30 min to McArthur Burney Falls (also a easy flat highway) a must see, very beautiful water falls. We had a picture lunch there and enjoyed the falls for a while. Next, we drove back to Lassen and did the trail of Manzanita Lake at Lassen VNP about 1 hour to go around the lake. We did not do the kayak because we arrived after 3pm. But I highly recommend to do kayaking in the lake if you have the time. Then we took a shower at Manzanita store. Great hot shower. Bring more quarters. The store has everything you need. Stayed at Crags camp site the second night. Day 3: We drove from north of LassenVNP to the south. Stopped a several view points to take pictures. Not crowded. We saw many lakes in different areas. Very peaceful views. Finally we were there, the highlight of the trip - Bumpass Hell. 1.5 hour round trip hike. Rough ground. Beautifull mountain/lake view. Lots of purple wild flowers. The day was not too hot. we felt very comfortable. My 9 yr old did not feel difficult.I did research at TripAdvisor to plan this weekend getaway trip.

We visited Lassen Volcanic Park several different days and each time saw it in a new way depending on the time of day as well as entering the park from different entrances.

We got to the park around 9 am, had something to eat and drink in the visitor center then took the drive along route 89 that winds through the park. You can stop at various highlights along the way like the Sulfur Works where you get that rotten egg smell near the boiling mud, tons of fun ! We toured around for about 4 hours until we reached the North exit then drove back. I recommend that if you decide to drive through you should invest $6 on the road guide as it has a lot of great information on all the sites you will see and where to stop. Take some sandwiches and drinks for the way and stop at Kings Creek for a little picnic lunch.

The hiking trails have several levels of difficulty but most from the southern entrance are doable by beginners (or seniors). The road from the southern entrance takes a route around Mt. Lassen with wonderful views from many vantage points. Unfortunately, to visit the lava fields the Northeast entrance must be used which requires leaving the park and driving a considerable distance.

Mount Lassen,"We visited Mount Lassen this summer - a place I went with my family a number of times as I was growing up. As a National Park, it has much to offer to folks of all ages and abilities, allowing for a deeper understanding of volcanoes and hydrothermal activity.With a variety of ecosystems, forests and climates, this is a place that one can explore for days. The visitor center is a great place to start and you can even see actual photographs of Lassen's exploding (quite an amazing feet for the turn of the last century). There are the Sulphur Works and the Devastation Trail for a close up, self guided tour that is easy enough for everyone and wheelchair accessible. If you love to hike, Bumpass Hell Trail is not to be missed - the hydrothermal experience is amazing. Lakes Helen and Emerald are beautiful, clear and cool.

The parking lot only had 6 or 7 cars out of a possible probably 120 spots. One could climb about a mile before the closure if one chooses. Still one could take photographs from the base. Because of this closure, the parking lot at the head of the trail to Bumpass Hell which is nearby was all full with cars circling around trying to find a spot.

Mount Lassen,"As California residents, we've driven by Mt. Lassen on I-5 many times. We finally made the decision to drive the 45 minutes off I-5 to the park and have no regrets, It was well worth the drive and the ""lost"" day on our drive north to Canada. After a one-hour stop at the visitor center (Recommend the 30 minute movie), we drove on to the Bumpass Hell trail and hiked the 1.5 miles (3.0 miles RT) into the largest concentration of hydrothermal features in the park. Bumpass Hell was named after an early settler who severly burned a leg after falling into a boiling pool. The active area is a wide basin filled with various steaming pools and unusual multi-colored soils, stained by sulphur and other minerals. Further into the park we did the 1.5 mile RT hike to Cold Boiling lake where natural gas bubbles up through the lake waters. This is an easy walk and a beautiful lake, but not what I'd consider a spectacle. The gas bubbles could almost be overlooked if one didn't know about them in advance.I had always considered Lassen to be the lone volcano in the park. We learned that Lassen Park has 21 ancient volcanoes of four different types. Our limited time allowed us only to visit the southern half of the park, but we'll definitely return. One cannot help walk away from Lassen Park without feeling awestruck by the unpredictable natural forces of our living planet.If you plan to visit, always check weather conditions and be prepared for anything. The weather can change at any time, as you are up at the 8,500' elevation. Also, if you plan to hike...even the well-used trail, bring water, snacks and plan to arrive back at your car well before dark. And do walk cautiously. Trails can have unexpected tripping obstacles...irregular boulders, tree roots and loose gravel. Its better to walk out than have to be carried. :-) Enjoy!!","August 3, 2013",Wonderful Discovery,33,"San Francisco, California",5

It is much too cold to qualify as ""enjoyable"" but with teens it was a rite of passage to do a polar bear swim in JULY.

The parking lot is ample, pit toilet in roomy cinderblock building, nice picnic tables on overlook near parking. Steep path to shore from picnic tables, wear shoes until at water edge.

Unless you're looking to camp or hike, Lassen is a bit of a snooze. On the plus side there are no crowds, on the minus side, if you've been to the likes of Yellowstone, Yosemite, Crater Lake, Arches, etc. you'll be bored. It's a long detour from I-5 in California and my recommendation for typical National Park ""sightseers"" is to take a pass and leave it to those who really Lassen's remote beauty. Head up to Crater Lake, Mt. St. Helens, Columbia River Gorge or even the area around Mt. Shasta (an even more impressive volcano).","July 13, 2013",Not worth a long detour,14,Los Angeles,3
Mount Lassen,The park was nice and there was still some snow. It is was nice for us to learn about the various volcanoes and history. The park rangers are really strict about the Junior Ranger program. My 6 year old had to complete the whole book of activities and do 4 more activities even though the activity book clearly states 5 activities in the book as all the other National Parks. They took it a bit too seriously and it tempered my view of the park.

I'm amazed every time is see it, its huge, you can also hike down into the center of it. The only problem for me is there are no dogs allowed ON the cinder cone, I believe they are allowed in the campground and Around the cinder cone. Out of all the things to do in the north state, hiking the Cinder Cone is on the top of my list! Fun for the family, friends, couples, school field trips and solo.

There was snow on the ground under the trees and all the mountains were snow capped. We watched the movie in the auditorium and saw the exhibits.

Mount Lassen,"We timed our road trip to make sure the trail would be open to the peak. It has been undergoing maintenance for a couple years and will last for possibly a couple more (thru 2014) so the last 0.9 mile was closed most of the summer hiking season.There's nothing particularly interesting about the trail itself other than the various views you are afforded as you ascend Lassen Peak. It's clear the trail will be nicer once their project is done, but there's nothing difficult about it now aside from the elevation gain. That was a bit much for my son (14 at the time) who isn't in the best shape and this was our first day at elevation, but he stuck to it (I'd already bought him the shirt so he had to - LOL) and 3.5 hours later we were finally at the summit calling mom back home.

But when you reach the top and see Mt. Shasta it makes it so worth the time! It takes about 4 hours to go up and back. It wasn't cold at the top although there was still enough snow.

The new Kohm Ya Ma nee Visitor Center off highway 36 (about an hour east of Red Bluff) is a good place to start. It has interactive exhibits that the kids will love and an excellent movie that explains the park's volcanic history. In Lassen, there are several areas of fumaroles and hot spots. The most crowded is Bumpass Hell, off of the main park highway 89. This highway frequently doesn't open until July due to heavy winter snow. Another volcanic area is available with only an hour or so easy hike through picture-perfect meadows. This area is called Boiling HotSprings and you can reach it through the eastern end of the park/Warner Valley. We've taken hikes here in July and August where we have had great hikes and encountered relatively few other hiking parties.

Mount Lassen,"In August 2011, I did two things that I never thought I would do, two things that were so scary I wondered if I would survive them. It all started on a long-planned, five-day camping and hiking vacation in Mt. Lassen Volcanic National Park in north-eastern California. WOW! This place was so different from the usual camping and hiking trips we take along the California coast or Sacramento valley. The park extends from about 6,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude. Everything was still green in August and there were fields of wildflowers among the green trees and verdant mountains. But there was also a couple of inches of snow on the ground in many places. After stopping at the Visitor's center for a fabulous sandwich and big chocolate/vanilla soft serve ice cream cone, and 20-minute movie about the remarkable geologic formation of four different types of still-active volcanoes at the park, we began exploring the visitor center grounds on our own.The coolest thing about Lassen is that the powers at be constructed the main road through most of the interesting natural wonders that people want to see. From you car you can see mud pots (below) belching their acrid and rotten-egg stinky sulfuric odors.There are also waterfalls, flowerful meadows, trees, trees, and more trees, mountains, streams and rivers and little lakes along the northerly main road up to nearly the northern end of the park, where we camped at Manzanita Lake. But it took us about three hours to get there, mostly because we had to stop at every vista point and take pictures and marvel at the sheer beauty of the place! It only took about 30 minutes to get the campsite totally set up. All foodstuffs and anything with a scent (e.g., toothpaste, lotion) had to be locked up in a bear locker at one end of our campsite. It was HOT that day, so we stopped by the little camp store and bought more ice cream on our way back to the campsite. After rest that afternoon and dinner, we decided that it would be cool to go back to the far side of the lake and wait for night fall to catch the Milky Way over Mt. Lassen. We caught exquisite pictures as the sun fell. It was pitch black when we returned, thinking bears were watching us as our head lamps and flashlight app on my iPhone pierced the darkness. This was the first scary event of our trip.We decided to hike up the Cinder Cone Volcano, which is an incredibly steep and harrowing 600 feet up from bottom to top. Start as early in the morning as possible, take lots of water, an energy snack or two, and a walking stick. Further around the base of the Cinder Cone Volcano are brightly-colored cinder beds. Mt. Lassen looms 4,000 feet higher in elevation. The views are phenomenal!I would also recommend a moderately difficult hike to King's Creek. Bring great walking shoes, a backpack with lots of water and food, a jacket in case it gets cool, plenty of sunscreen. And a camera to capture incredible views of wild flowers, numerous waterfalls, and a panorama of mountain ranges.I conquered my fears at Mt. Lassen and am ready to go back for more adventures!","October 15, 2012",Conquer Your Fears at Mt. Lassen National Volcanic Park,31,"Sacramento, California",5

Mount Lassen,I came here during August 2012 when major wildfires were going just west of the park. The park was partially open but filled with smoke and hardly had anyone in it. I was still able to see a nice amount of the park. Lassen has the geothermal features of Yellowstone but on a smaller scale and not nearly as dramatic as what you will see there. The rest of the park reminds me of the High Country of Yosemite along Tioga Pass Road. This is a very nice park but once you have been to Yellowstone and Yosemite it is hard to rank Lassen as a 5 though it certainly lacks the crowds of those two parks.

We only had one day to see this park which was enough, however, had we had another day I would have hiked a couple of the lake trails. The Bumpas Hell was equal to some parts of Yellowstone in learning about hydrothermal features. We found the history of eruptions of Lassen as interesting as the science of the features. If you only have one day, drive from one end to the other and stop at all the main sites. Start at the visitor center with the movie and a plan from one of the rangers.

Mount Lassen,"As we entered the park off highway 44 east of Redding, California we immediately stopped at the visitor center to obtain information about the sights and activities. Inside the visitor center was a museum as well as a very accommodating and helpful staff of rangers to answer our questions. Because the volcano blew its top less than one hundred years ago we were informed that the volcano was ""sleeping"". In other words the volcano could wake up at any time. Scientists apparently monitor this sleeping giant constantly. We took our chances anyway that the mountain would remain asleep while we visited and traveled to various attractions all the way to the opposite entrance located off highway 89. We decided to hike to ""Bumpass Hell"" a very popular area to witness the ground regurgitating steam, bubbling mud and boiling water from the earths interior. It was about a 3 mile roundtrip from the large parking lot just off the main roadway. When you arrive at Bumpass Hell you would be angry if you didn't bring your camera. Beautiful above ground pathways lead you around and above this 16 acre wonder. It is obvious that deep inside the earth mother nature is busy at work ""recycling"" its infrastructure. The obnoxious gases floating in the air smell of rotten eggs. We also traveled and photographed scenic vistas of surrounding territory. Informational signs were everywhere to help the visitor learn about the immediate area. Campgrounds and small lakes to float kayaks, canoes etc. were everywhere. Before this giant wakes up again (and it will) put this activity as a place to see . You will be glad you did and be sure to bring your children/grandchildren.

There was a camp store within walking distance where we could pick up food, beverages and firewood. Once settled we set out to tour the park. The peaks were magnificent, but the most interesting thing was the hike to the mud pots. It looked like a walk on the moon - or certainly a different world than mother earth. The lakes were also beautiful and we walked around one of them and decided it was too far away from conveniences to camp there with our grandson who loved the camp store.

This park is amazing in what it has to offer - everything from beautiful mountain lakes, majestic peaks, sulfurous mud pots and steaming cauldrons. One is very much aware that this is a live, active, volcanic area. The hikes range from easy to strenous - don't forget that most of the park lies around 5000 feet plus so it is already a mile up in the air. Right now, they are re-doing the trail to Lassen peak so that trail is closed but you can get the same thrill going up Broke Off mountain. Also not to be missed is Bumpass Hell - aptly named as the smell of sulphur and the sight of bubbling mud pots and steaming cauldrons is truly a vision of the underworld.

The hike is rated difficult by the park, but i think that almost everyone should be able to do this hike with frequent breaks, plenty of water, and going at the right pace. The trail head has a large parking lot because it is a popular hike. It is easily navigated. There will be many people on the trail so no worries of getting lost. Most of the hike is not shaded because you're too high for trees! You start at around 8000 elevation and hiking up 2000 before reaching the summit at 10,000 something elevation. It is a steep incline because you gain 2,000 feet in about 2 miles. However, as I said, just take your time, pick a pace, and drink water. I got to the top in an hour and a half with plenty of resting, photo taking, and just going at my comfortable pace. Some people can take up to 2 or 3 hours to reach the top, and that's totally fine! Doesn't matter how fast as long as you get there.The summit is amazing with lots of places to explore.

Be aware of weather changes, and if clouds start coming in get down off any exposed rock as quickly and safely as possible. The park is also at higher elevation, and those who are sensitive may have trouble with the thin air. That being said, when I was there last I saw small children, older people using walkers and everyone in between. From the visitors center and small lakes to the high rocky trails to the picnic areas everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and there was something for everyone.","July 26, 2012",Love this park!,27,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Mount Lassen,"Lassen Volcanic National Parks was our favourite National Park in Western USA. Our adventure began at the Kolm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Centre near the southern entrance to the park. Here we watched an interesting movie about the history of the Lassen Volcano and the geology of the formations found in the park. After visiting the gift shop we took an amazing two hour drive through the park up into the highlands area. Along the way we passed the Sulphur Works and Bumpass Hell which all feature active volcanic activity with mud pots and steaming fumaroles and boiling water. However we were thrilled to see snowfields, walls of ice and frozen lakes at the road's highest point of 8500ft. The views here were simply breathtaking. The scenery was spectacular with remnants of old volcanoes and slopes of rock strewn boulders in the Devastated Area. All in all our drive through the park was truly memorable.","July 22, 2012",Lassen - Our Favourite National Park,179,Townsville,5
Mount Lassen,"We wanted to visit this park a while ago, finally got the chance to visit it this year. What a beautiful NP it is, not overly crowded and with so much to see.Bumpass Hell (a must), Kings Creek (a lot of mosquito), Cinder Cone (one of the best in the park, with a very steep climb to reach the top. Just go slow and you will made it to the top).It's a lot smaller then some of the NP in Cal. but with many things to see.Overall, we had a great time and will recommend any friend or people to visit this underrated NP.Enjoy the great outdoor.","July 20, 2012",Wonderful Park with so much to see,24,"San Jose, California",5

The park road was open all the way across the park.; You can easily drive it in a few hours, but do stop at many places to admire the wonders of this (still active, but sleeping) volcano. There are many places to camp also. The 8500 summit on the road is just at the base of this volcano, and the two lakes were still partially frozen even in July! The new visitors center is full of information; and a must stop!

There are many well-known parks that I haven’t yet visited but I can't imagine any of them being any cleaner or more beautiful (except Crater Lake and Lake Tahoe maybe). It is well marked with signage showing the parks volcanic history. The weather in early July was perfect with some snow still on the mountain tops.The only problem is the choices for lodging in the general area (no big chains any were close).

Mount Lassen,"I returned to Lassen in the winter and snowshoed the Main Park Road to Lake Helen which is about 12.4 miles round-trip. We camped at Lake Helen. Our first day out was clear and beautiful. It snowed overnight and we had whiteout conditions in the morning. However, it wasn't frightening as we had appropriate gear and the rangers had prepared us with advice and I felt secure that they knew where we were, were we to have a real emergency. I'd never been snowshoeing or winter camping before, and this was quite the introductory experience. There were very few people, especially after Diamond Peak--I think we saw one. I'd recommend it strongly to anyone seeking solitude, beauty, and a winter camping experience.","July 15, 2012",Lassen in the Snow,10,"Berkeley, California",5

From short loop trails to day hikes to long backpack trips, you're covered. Fishing and birdwatching are good - and winter cross country skiing.Suitable for families and folks of all ages. The only drawback is there are only a couple of campgrounds and only one lodging, Drakesbad Guest Ranch, which is out of the main park area but well worth a visit.Lodging is available in the nearby town of Mineral, and more campgrounds & attractions, such as the ice cave & great fishing, along Hat Creek to the north.Gorgoues.

Mount Lassen,"Mt Lassen is much more rugged than its graceful and serene big sister Shasta, which is considered holy by many naturists and Natives. However, Lassen is well worth taking a few side roads off Interstate 5 or US 395 to access its lava-strewn slopes. The best access is taking State Route 36 east out of Red Bluff, then Route 89 north to the new Lassen Visitors Center and the best views of the volcano. You will find the Visitors Center excellent for introducing the geology and biology of this unique national park. If possible, arrange for a ranger-guided tour or other presentation by staff, many which are especially good for children. Before Washington State's Mt Saint Helens blew its top in 1980, Mt Lassen was the last volcano to erupt in the Lower 48 states, and last rumbled in 1917. Since then, the magma chamber has retreated and the region has been generally quiet. Geologists currently expect no eruptions in the near future. Be sure to have a sweater because it can be quite chilly any time of year. You'll be in the Cascade Range which is infamous for changeable weather and when you step out at Route 89's summit on the flanks of Lassen, you'll be at 8500 ft and breathing cool mountain air off lingering snowfields. A few side trips are possible, but some must be made on foot. The Park Service pretty much restricts vehicles to a narrow corridor along Route 89, in order to preserve some of Lassen's unique biological zones such as the hellish-sounding but recovering ""Devastated Area"" and the ""Chaos Crags"". If you follow my suggested route, you can exit the park conveniently at Manzanita Lake which has groceries, food and a gasoline station. Bottom line: This park can be very generously visited, easily, in one day and is often just right while you are doing extensive travel. I highly recommend visiting Lassen especially before it erupts again in 90 years or so.","June 26, 2012","Prior to Mt St Helens, Lassen was most active volcano in the Lower 48.",776,"Moreno Valley, California",4

Going there in mid-June there were still some attractions we couldn't enjoy because they had just received 11 more inches of snow 2 days before! My suggestion would be a July or August visit when the snows have melted and all of the attractions are availble. I will say that all of the things that we could enjoy are just the tip of the iceberg and were amazing!!! All 4 types of volcanoes are represented in this park, huge fields with clear, mossy streams running through and amazing, boiling sulfer springs and rivers are just a few things we did get to take pleasure in while we were there!

Lots of snow to play in and the beautiful scenery make it a detour well worth doing. The only drawback was that Bumpass Hell was still not open due to snow levels.

Mount Lassen,"Wow. In any other state, this would be the crown jewel. Here in California where it has to compete with Yosemite and the coast, it gets overlooked. That is a shame. What an amazing place! I came expecting to be wowed by the geothermal features and the volcanic landscape, and I was not disappointed. I did not know about the many, many high alpine lakes and the wildflower show. I felt like I was walking in a painting, but if you painted this, people would think you were silly. It has to be experienced. Add this park to your list!Advice: If you are doing a long hike in the summer, wear small gators to keep the pebbles out of your shoes or boots. The mosquitos can be bad. Prepare accordingly. There is cryptosporidium in the lakes, so you need to bring a treatment method that will address that (many pumps don't, boiling for 5 minutes does).","September 19, 2011","If you painted this, people would think you were silly",1,"Berkeley, California",5

In any other state, this park would be the crown jewel. It gets overlooked in California because of the coast and Yosemite, I guess. It shouldn't, though, because it has its own amazing essence. The geothermal features, carpets of wildflowers, cold lakes, and high, clear alpine air are just superb. This place looks like a painting.We hiked out from Butte Lake, spent a night near one of the many lakes along the trail, hiked back. Car camped at the Butte Lake campground, and then hiked up near Bumpass Hell. I felt like this gave us a good survey of the Park, but I can tell that there are fabulous backcountry experiences to be had on the next trip.Tips: Wear some low gators if you are hiking near the volcanic features to keep the gravel out of your shoes.There is cryptosporidium in the lakes, so come prepared with water, treatment that will kill it, or enough fuel to boil what you will need for 5 minutes.","September 12, 2011","In any state without a Yosemite, this would be the crown jewel",10,"Berkeley, California",5
Mount Lassen,"We took a day trip to Lassen's to the Northwest entrance. We were surprised then that the park was basically closed. We were told that the mountain had 260% above average snow pack and that was evident by the snow drifts surrounding the Visitors center. It was absolutely breathtaking! We were still able to drive a few miles to take in some awesome snow white scenery and the sulfuric pools were walking distance from the visitors center so it wasn't a total loss. We were also told that all of the campgrounds were closed at the time and they were unsure if Lassen Peak trail would open. We did return in July but this time we decided to stay at Hat Creek Resort- an overlooked awesome campground that is only 23 miles from Lassen's Southwest Entrance. It's centrally located between several ""must sees"" that the average tourist might over look. But since we live just 3 hours away, we visit Lassen and always stay at Hat Creek.Aside from a short drive to Lassen Park, it is about 1 mile from the volcanic lava tubes which are an awesome sight. TAKE flashlights because you cannot walk the tube without one. It is a very short walk, about 10 minutes. The floor is very bumpy and hard lava rock. In fact, I had to chuckle when a woman emerged and said ""They need to fix the floor in there; the concrete is cracked and raising in several areas"". Anyway, it opens to a well marked trail through the Manzanita Grove- which are common throughout the area.Take a day and drive about 30 miles to Burney Falls which is in all its glory from the melting snow pack. It's a 130 foot fall that is stunning and the water is turgoise blue. A great photo opp for you with the Falls in the background. Burney Falls is in the Cascade Mountains of Lassen park the ""8th wonder of the world"" (President Roosevelt) and there is an awesome and easy hiking trail that goes past Rainbow Bridge and provides breathtaking scenery all the way to the back side of Manzanita Lake in Lassen Park- just a 3.5 mile round trip and easy walking. We even pushed a stroller with a 2 year old. The hardest part was the stairs from the top of the park area down to the Falls base. From there, it's nothing but nature!A quick plug for Hat Creek... It's located in Old Station. I love it because it's not full blown hard camping. Call me a wimp but I do like a shower! They have showers, flush toilets, a rec room for kids with shuffle board and pool table, a basket ball area and grass area to play ball, Frisbee, etc. A lot of regulars and even permanents are there in the R.V. area. They have a section for those that like to rough it in a tent; but my favorite are their YURTS! They have them to sleep from 1-5. You get a double size futon and/or a double and single bunk bed depending on the size of your gang. It has a small hotel refridgerator, microwave, and T.V. It also has hard floors and canvas walls with side windows you can zipper down during the day or a skylight window to view the stars. They only have 3 on the property but at 60 something a night, 2 couples are only paying about $30 something per couple. Also comes complete with fire pit and picnic table. Yurts lock up too. If you fish, Hat Creek runs right through the middle of the campground and the fishing is plenty. My 8 year old grandson caught his first, second, and third fish! You can use live bait too. The campground is well patrolled and the groundskeepers are all very nice and ready to help. There is a store on the grounds within walking distance for anyone. The closest town is Burney so on your trip to the falls, if you want to do some major shopping stop in their Safeway market. It's a good size little town.Well, hope I helped someone know a bit more about Lassen. Although I am sure you can find plenty at the Lassen Park, there are plenty of other wonders in the area. Oh, and please do take some time to watch their 10 minute video at the Visitor center in Lassen. It is worth it. On a final note: TAKE MOSQUITO REPELLENT! Heed that warning. Also, a jacket will be needed at night although the days are warm.I am leaving again tomorrow for my 3 days at Hat Creek.

Mount Lassen,"Lassen Peak Trail is the most popular hike in the park. The distance may seem short, but the trail is steep and at high elevation. The NPS rates this trail as strenuous. I would allow 4 hours to complete. The hike itself is barren with switchback after switchback. The view at the top is breathtaking and gives you the rights to brag that you hiked an active volcano.Currently the trail is only partially open (due to a much needed trail restoration project).Hikers are unable to make it to the top of Lassen. Because of this I would highly recommend some of the following options…If you are looking for a strenuous hike try Brokeoff Mountain. The trail is full of enjoyable scenery with pleasing views at the top. I strongly suggest trying the Bumpass Hell Trail. The moderate hike leads you to the largest geothermal site west of Yellowstone. You get acres of bubbling mud pots with the aroma of rotting eggs (sulfur). This is an entertaining, educational hike that stimulates all of the senses.For smaller crowds try Mill Creek Falls, Crags Lake, Kings Creek Falls, or Echo Lake.","August 26, 2011",It doesn’t matter what trail you choose as long as you take the time to get off the road and enjoy the parks beauty.,47,"Chico, California",5

Mount Lassen,"In the last week of July, my husband and I, traveled to Lassen Park for camping and hiking. We checked the weather conditions at the Park beforehand and all was well. Arriving, the Park Entrance Ranger told us that our trail destination, Bumpass Hell (to the thermal pools) was open, and that the trail would be difficult but passable, muddy with some patches of snow. We arrived at Bumpass with our heavy hiking boots and sturdy walking sticks. The snow pack was incredibly thick and a small crowd was gathered at the trailhead with dubious looks. The trailhead sign said ""Hazardous"" . Yet several small groups had forged ahead, even some kids wearing sneakers. We started out slightly upslope, and began immediately slipping on thin ice, slogging in mud holes and sinking into soft snow. As we continued, we encountered many people coming back. We followed back as well, concerned that the trail further on would be impassable. We thought that the Park was crazy to have opened this trail. Indeed, several rangers we met in other areas deeper into the Park, were convinced that Bumpass was still closed. The moral of the story: Definitely call the Park beforehand to check specific trail conditions, hoping that the Rangers at the entrance are in agreement with the interior Rangers. Thankfully, the fishing just outside and below the Park was great!","August 16, 2011",Call beforehand for trail conditions,86,"Roseville, California",4
Mount Lassen,"Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California is one of the relatively undiscovered Precious Gems of the National Park System. It is simply stunning! As National Parks go, it is relatively small but what magnificent beauty and diversity is packed into this treasure. Simply driving the main road through the park will open up breath- taking vistas, such as Manzanita Lake, Lassen Peak,and Broke-off Mountain, to name a few! Hikers will have a great time exploring Bumpass Hell, Kings Creek Falls, Miller Creek Falls, Devil's Kitchen, and Cinder Cone, just for starters. There are many miles of hiking trails for backpackers too!","August 12, 2011",Undiscovered Precious Gem,223,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Mount Lassen,"Beautiful views in every direction and so many incredible sights make Lassen NP a perfect destination. The visitor center is fun and informative, showing an interesting movie about the volcano and the history of the park. A great gift shop with lots of childrens' books at reasonable prices, too. Pack a picnic lunch and stop at one of the many picnic areas. The park is wonderfully uncrowded and the trails easy for children to navigate. Take in the natural beauty and clean air everywhere you turn in this lovely place! ENJOY!!!","August 5, 2011","Oh so beautiful, pristine, fresh air.

Mount Lassen,"The drive from Redding is picturesque and rural and helps set the mood for this gorgeous park that is a little off the beaten path. We drove around and through all the campgrounds and really enjoyed the scenic beauty of this park. There was a lot of snow this year so unfortunately, we couldn't hike the mountain, but once they are done with the trail renovation, it will be worth the wait. All of the hikes in this park are worth it, and you feel like you are the only ones here much of the time. The hike to Bumpass Hell has a lot of activity on it, but it is fun to see the mudpots and smell the sulfur that is still escaping this active volcano. This is a great place to camp and we are coming back next year to camp. Not a lot of amenities, but that is what makes it so peaceful and keeps it pristine. Go spend some time if you like the outdoors and enjoy this truly beautiful park.","July 31, 2011",Beautiful National Park that is so overlooked and uncrowded!!!,4,"Victorville, CA",5
Mount Lassen,"Had a wonderful, uncrowded time at Mt. Lassen July 19 - 23. we camped at Crags campground and had our pick of camping sites. Unfortunately, the trail to the top of the mountain was closed so we spent our time checking out Bumpas Hell and Lake Manzanita. We brought our snow sled and spend time slidig down the peak trailhead snow into the parking lot. Ken","July 28, 2011",Mt Lassen and Crags Campground,2,"Sacramento, California",4
Mount Lassen,"Lassen is spectacular. It's not crowded, being somewhat isolated. We loved the Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center, and the Loomis Museum (named after B.F. Loomis, the photog that caught the Lassen 1914-1915 eruption on film). Massive mountains, tumbling streams, pristine snowfields. It's definitely worth a trip!","June 21, 2011",Stunning scenery and great hiking,58,"Shasta Lake, California",5
Mount Lassen,"If you live around Northern California, love the outdoors and look for a eduational place to bring young kids to, it is a great National park to go to. Fantastic volcanic geology, mud puddle and hot spots (Bumpass Hell). Great kid friendly ranger's programs. Great campsite too.","October 9, 2010","Very unique place, Yellowstone in California",3,"San Jose, California",4
Mount Lassen,"We visited here in August and stayed just outside the park in Mineral. Although it was really warm, we were surprised to still see snow on the ground. When we visited access to the Lassen Peak Trail was restricted, but we visited Bumpus Hell which the kids loved, and also visited Summit Lake which is really beautiful. Nice to visit a National Park that isn't overun with tourists in the summer, it was one of the most peaceful places I have ever visited.","September 7, 2010",Beautiful - Little Known National Park,129,"Dorset, United Kingdom",5
Mount Lassen,"If you have only a short time to visit Lassen, take the time to hike the Bumpass Hell Trail. This 3 mile round trip hike takes you into the area of the park containing the mudpots and hissing fumaroles. The hydrothermal basin has something for everyone, including the sulpher smells.This is uneven terrain, so have the proper footware and bring water. There are no restrooms once you leave the parking lot.Our 7 year old daughter was able to make this trip with not much of a problem. Thankfully we were preprared with a light snack which gave her a much needed second wind!Of course, this is nothing like Yellowstine National Park, but this trail will keep your interest. Besides the mudpots and fumeroles, there are lovely views of the moutnains and lakes.","September 3, 2010",Bumpass Hell Trail,283,"Castro Valley, California",5

Mount Lassen,"This is a strenuous hike -- about 5 miles round trip, but so worth the effort! This peak erupted on May 15, 1922, and this southernmost active volcano in the Cascade Range devastated nearby areas and rained volcanic ash as far away as 200 miles to the east. This was the most powerful explosion in the 1914-17 series of eruptions that were the last to occur in the Cascades before the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens. There are so many fantastic vistas of the park and surrounding areas from the trail. The summit provides one of the most spectacular views of the Devastated Area. I would recommend beginning this hike earlier in the day (before 12 noon), as afternoon thunderstorms are common, as are lightening strikes on the mountain.","March 13, 2009",Lassen Peak Trail,158,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mount Lassen,"I went on a 9 day camping trip which consisted of a 50 mile hike with Troop 315 of Middletown, Ca. I had such a great time camping out there. My troop and I went swimming at the lakes saw a baby black bear and climbed to the top of the old volcano and into the center. I miss those times dearly and I hope that I will get another opportunity to visit the Caribou Wilderness again.Jason LewisTroop 315Middletown, Ca","September 1, 2007",BoyScout Troop 315 Trip,6,Washington,5
Mount Lassen,"Took a drive from Reno to Mt. Lassen. Fortunately the weather has been good and the roads in the park were open. Tried to see most major areas: Sulpher Works--Short walk just off the road. Two steaming vents the first time, 5 or 6 on our way back. Boardwalk closed. I guess some of it has been destroyed and it didn't sound like it was going to be replaced. Trail to the peak-10 feet of snow at the start of the trail. I tried to navigate the trail, but couldn't get past the snow, btw the shop and snack bar in the parking are was very good. Bumpass Hell-It looked like it would be great to walk down there, but it was closed due to snow. Devastated Area-Amazing how those large rocks traveled that far from the mountain. Nice little informative trail. Summit Lake-Picturesque lake. Nice picnic area. Several photo opportunities. Mill Creek Falls-We were probably the last ones on the trail before they closed it due to the visitor center construction. Had trouble finding the trail head due to snow. Slid down the mountain until we found it. It took about an hour to walk to the falls. We crossed two creeks on the way (one by bridge and one over rocks). The trail a little steep in places, but it was still a fairly easy walk. The falls are real nice and it empties into a creek that flows through a gorge. It was worth the walk. We didn't see too much wildlife, 3 deers and that was about it. The park road-A nice drive with some great views. My only complaint was the lack of information on the roads. Had to double back several times after we passed an attraction we were looking for. I would like to go again when there is less snow and to hike a few trails we didn't have time to hike the first time.","June 17, 2007",Awesome,103,Virginia Beach,5
Mount Lassen,"Visited Lassen National Park in early August, 2005. We climbed to the top of Lassen Peak, which is over 10,000 feet up. The hike is fairly strenuous, 2,000 feet of elevation gain, although we saw kids doing it. There was lots of snow around still. The view from the top was worth it, you could see for many miles. It is also the highest point in the region so the view is unobstructed.","January 1, 2006",Top of the World,16,Sherman Oaks,5
Mount Lassen,"My kids and I hiked Lassen Peak one afternoon in August 2005. This is a very steep and challenging hike but can be accomplished by anyone in decent shape. All you need to do is take your time and enjoy the fabulous views along the way. It took us about 4 hours round trip with a stay at the top of about 30 minutes. The views from the peak are amazing. Most of the hike is well above the tree line so you can see forever. we encountered many small animals, birds, numerous butterflies and several varieties of wildflowers. All with the presence of deep snow in summer. The kids had a nice little snowball fight but tired quickly due to the hike and altitude. I have a small ""quicktime"" video of the hike on my site for anyone who is interested.http://www.ronhebert.com/videos/Lassen.movThis was a great hike!","August 11, 2005",Fabulous Hike,445,"Windsor, Canada",5
