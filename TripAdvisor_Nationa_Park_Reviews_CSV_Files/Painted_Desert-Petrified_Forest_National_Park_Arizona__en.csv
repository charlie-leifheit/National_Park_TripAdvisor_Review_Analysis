Painted Desert,We learned the Petrified Forest is part of a larger region called the Painted Desert. It is a national park with entrance fee of $20 per car. We had the lifetime unlimited pass so didn’t have to pay. Takes a while to drive and visit the look outs of the entire trail. The visitor information center is very helpful. Blue Mesa had the most petrified wood. All the look outs had spectacular views. ,"October 13, 2019",Petrified Forest National Park,100,"Ponce Inlet, Florida",5
Painted Desert,"If you are anywhere within the area, make it a point to see this. It is incredible and breathtaking, and be sure to take your camera. And, you can drive through. There are several look-out points, and walking trails, also.","October 6, 2019",Excellent and must see!,25,"Lake Wylie, South Carolina",5
Painted Desert,"The range of vistas in the Petrified Forest National Park is incredible. We spent 6 hours travelling the 26 miles of the park due to stopping at every view point and walking almost every trail. Highly recommend the Blue Mesa, Crystal Forest and Agate House trails to give the best idea of the range of terrain. Skip the movie at the visitor centre. Take water when you walk as it is hot in the desert, even in October!","October 3, 2019","Incredible colours, variety and size!",1,,5
Painted Desert,"We didn't think we'd make it to the Painted Desert on our recent trip out west but we were pleasantly surprised how well we could view it during our excursions through the national monuments north of Flagstaff. With the binoculars we could see the vivid colors quite well even though we were probably 60+ miles away. It appeared quite vast and was certainly quite beautiful. There is so much to see in the Southwest USA and even though our trip spanned two weeks, we could only cover so much ground. We were really appreciative that we could view the Painted Desert and the 3 stars is only because we were so far away.","October 3, 2019",Admired from Afar,4,,3
Painted Desert,"We spent a week in Flagstaff and were determined to see all the sights within a couple hours' drive. My recommendation is is you are seeing the Petrified Forest and the Grand Canyon in the same trip, go to the Petrified Forest National Park first, and the Grand Canyon second. We went to the Petrified Forest the next day after visiting the Grand Canyon. It is a solid hour and a half drive from Flagstaff with a long stretch of nothingness. Make sure you have plenty of gas. It is a great destination if you don't want to walk much. They have different hiking trails at overlook points if you want to hike, but you can see everything from the car with very little walking. They offer maps and a short movie in the welcome center. They have clean bathrooms and it is a beautiful place, it just was a little underwhelming after we had just visited the Grand Canyon. I wish we had seen this in reverse order. Very interesting and beautiful scenery. it takes about an hour to drive the park if you don't spend time at the overlooks and hike.","October 1, 2019",Go see this before the Grand Canyon,0,,4
Painted Desert,"I love to travel to National Parks. Of all the ones I have visited this one is easily the top. It is a beautiful landscape that I am thankful we have preserved. It is located easily off the interstate and allows for a drive-through with multiple locations for pictures. You have to visit - also, check out the welcome centers at either end as they have fantastic presentations and artifacts. It is an outstanding opportunity.","September 30, 2019",Lifechanging,2,"Phoenix, Arizona",5

Painted Desert,"It’s a nice drive and worth driving through. We were in a hurry and didn’t want to take the time to walk. The walks were all shorand would be a nice break after driving for hours. The petroglyphs are really no longer visible. Many people were taking pictures and trying to convince themselves they could see something. I’ve seen better elsewhere. But, overall a nice scenic drive.","September 27, 2019",Nice,2,"Mesa, Arizona",3
Painted Desert,"I love our national parks and each one has its own story. From the pullouts to view the desert landscape, the petroglyphs, forest of petrified wood to the visitors center, a fantastic time is to be had at each place. On one side of the interstate is the desert and then the other side has the forest. You can spend as much time as you like viewing the surroundings. There is a fee unless you have a pass, which I recommend.","September 20, 2019",Third Visit and Still Impressive!,40,"Asheville, North Carolina",5
Painted Desert,This is adjacent to the interstate. I think this is a must stop. There is a fee to pay and then you can drive through both areas of this national park (petrified forest and painted desert). You can go out the back gate and this will take you back to the interstate. If you are looking to buy some petrified wood sales start right outside the back gate and more is in the nearby town.,"September 12, 2019",Outstanding,267,"Charleston, South Carolina",5

Painted Desert,"I planned to drive through this desert on our way from North Carolina to Grand Canyon. I only planned to skim through this. I was surprised at what beauty was waiting to be seen. Not only did we enjoy the views from the top through the easily navigable roads with pullouts we decided to hike through the Blue Mesa. The colors were astounding. Easy view that was available to us to see was outstanding. In the summer it is extraordinarily hot. Make certain to bring water, wear hats, and wear clothes that cover you from the sun. Make certain to stop at the old Inn. The day we were there, an amazing jeweler was there selling gorgeous bracelets. ","August 17, 2019",Amazing Surprise,84,"Asheville, North Carolina",5

Painted Desert,"Wonderful view of the Chinle Desert in North Central Arizona. The view road is paved and there are sufficient pullouts for better gazing. Try the rim walk to the Inn from Tawa Point. It's only 1/2 mile each way. Definitely stop at the Inn and read on its history. If you ask, a docent will give you a tour. Use Exit 311 on I-40 for the Painted Desert. It's a 28 mile drive from This VC to the Rainbow VC at the south end of the Petrified Forest. With stops and short walks, this might take you half a day.","August 10, 2019",Watch The Desert Turn Colors With The Changing Position Of Sun And Clouds,677,"Henderson, Nevada",4
Painted Desert,"Even though most people are very impressed with painted desert, I was not. Sure it is a nice sight to see and it is worth getting out of the car to take a couple of pictures, but I would not detour to see it. We were going to see petrified forest (which ws the highlight for me), so we passed through Painted Desert. It is very colorful, considering it is only sand ans stone. The landscape is fascinating and there is zero life visible, plant or animal. Of course there is more to it than meets the eye, but it looks luke a lunar landscape. Interesting to see. Perhaps the colors are better late in the afternoon, or later in the season. We were there in June and it was not very spectacular.","August 7, 2019",only because I wanted to see Petrified Forest,231,"Leidschendam, The Netherlands",4

Painted Desert,Decided to drive through again on our way to Sedona. We had been through here years ago and usually zip by the exit but not today. Best deal was getting in free using my Parks Pass I bought years ago. The road is 2 lane with clearly marked signs to see the various formations following the map from the entrance. Loved the petroglyphs at the Puerco Pueblo. There are lots of them at Newspaper Rock but hard to see without the two telescopes. Blue Mesa turnout produced the biggest color contrast in the Painted Desert. ,"August 3, 2019",Worth the side trip on way to Sedona ,255,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

Since we had our dog, Mr. Snickers, we didn’t hike any of the long trails. Since we entered from the south, we didn’t encounter as many cars as we passed headed to the south. We stopped at the old historic Route 66 on the north end got a picture of the Studebaker that is displayed there.","July 12, 2019",Painted Desert - north side of petrified forest,36,St. Croix,5

Painted Desert,"Everything I read about the National park focussed on the petrified forest. The fossilised wood is pretty cool and it is great to see the colours and the fossils look like logs. But the painted desert is even better, the colours in the strata and the formations remaining are stunning.I would recommend anyone to take the time to drive around and through the park.

Painted Desert,"the last time i visited this park was on a school field trip about 45 years ago. Needless to say, i enjoyed it much more this time. The best way to experience this park is to enter on the northern part accessed from I40. The painted desert is the first thing you see as you begin a drive through history. The colors of the soil are something you just have to see. don't miss this park just because it sounds like its all about sand and old wood. its amazing.","July 1, 2019",unforgettable scenery,66,"Mesa, Arizona",5
Painted Desert,"Painted desert was a much needed break as we traveled I40 for several days. The Painted Desert and the Petrified Forest are part of the same park and on the same road. To drive straight through and return would take around an hour, but add time for viewing stops. The fossilized wood is amazing. Being able to walk among and touch the petrified remains is a memory for sure. If one is traveling from the East on I40, save time by exiting I40 at exit 285 to Holbrook. US 180 then will take you to the the south entrance. Do stop at the Visitor Center and see the dinosaurs and begin exploring. From there the road will take you directly through the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert, right back to I40. Reserve time for stops. Well worth the time and new memories.","June 30, 2019",Painted Desert/Petrified Forest in June,5,,5
Painted Desert,Plan enough time to stop & admire this portion of Petrified Forest NP. 200 million years of erosion have created an amazing palette of colors that are changing constantly.

Painted Desert,"This is a nice drive to see colors, formations and beautiful landscape views. There are several pull off points for safe viewing and photo taking. The Painted Desert is adjacent to the Petrified Forest and near the Grand Canyon National Park so if you are in the area, I highly recommend seeing all of these places. I was amazed by the stunning bands of color in the rock formations that resulted from irregularly eroded layers of red and yellow sediment and bentonite clay. Fabulous views.","May 31, 2019","Beautiful views and colors, nice scenic drive",82,"Louisville, Kentucky",5
Painted Desert,"The painted desert can be seen by driving in several locations throughout Arizona. You can see it for free by driving north on 89 from Cameron to Tuba City which has spectacular views, from Tuba City you can head south on 264 and drive through the Indian reservation for some more sweeping views of the country following the signs to Highway 40 you can either head west towards Flagstaff or East towards Winslow. About an hour from Winslow is Holbrook, which is the major city near the entrance to the Petrified Forest National Park which does have a fee associated with it, when we were there it was 25.00 per car. The drive through the Petrified Forest is all about the Painted Desert as well. The Painted Desert formations are the main attraction as you drive along. If you want to see the petrified wood you need to get out and do a little walking, someplaces are easier than others if you have any trouble walking up and down hills. Be prepared for the local weather. We were there May 20 and it was only 38 degrees and the wind was blowing so hard it would take your breath away.

The Painted Desert Inn- now a historical site- was most interesting. Wish they still served meals there. After leaving Painted Desert, I drove through Petrified Forest, and found that really fascinating- especially the long trees by the Visitor's Center.

Painted Desert,We love visiting the natural wonders that we enjoy in America. I especially looked forward to this trip because my parents took us there way back in 1957! We checked out their website ahead of time so that we could plan our day. We went to the Petrified Forest first and hiked out to the Agate House and Long Logs trails which were very easy and wonderfully rewarding. Later we drove up to the painted desert and enjoyed the late afternoon views and a meal at the cafe there.,"May 9, 2019",Spectacular,113,"Santa Clarita, California",5
Painted Desert,"We combined this visit with the Petrified Forest, and what a wonderful day of photography it makes. A red layer of sandstone is being exposed by erosion. Most viewing is either from the roadside or viewpoints. These are geologically fragile, so do not tromp among them. This means most shots will be telephoto, but a zoom lens on a DSRL works nicely. This is high country, so watch the white balance, exposure etc. A polarizer would be useful. We saw many of the locations as possible abstracts.","April 29, 2019",Beautiful red hills for the amateur photographer,535,"Seattle, Washington",5
Painted Desert,"The views of the Painted Desert are awesome! You can find excellent lookout points right on the rim. If you're just in it for the views, you can drive to the inn near the visitors center at the north end and park and take a look. You can also take a short, easy hike to the inn from one of the pull-off points along the road, or, if you're looking for a longer hike, you can walk along the paved path from the north visitors center, which is about a mile and a half each way and has some really cool views of the desert, although there isn't much coverage from the sun, so beware if you're doing it in the middle of a hot day.","April 28, 2019",Great views!,11,"Wayne, Pennsylvania",4
Painted Desert,"I hadn’t been here in over 40 years. It’s as beautiful as I remember and made a notable impression on our teen. But, we had to chop an hour off our time to make it to Chinle later as we hadn’t known that the reservation was on DST. That meant we couldn’t get out and hike any trails. Sure, you can just do scenic overlooks, but I recommend getting out to walk the trails if you can.

Amazing to see such a change in God’s majestic creation; from mountains red rocks to badlands as far as you can see! We got suggestions at the visitor center and stopped at each location they recommended. All had different vantage points of pure beauty! You will want to physically walk the Blue Mesa trail instead of just viewing from above. There is a very steep incline as you start down so just take your time coming up if it’s too strenuous (trust me, it’s worth it). ","April 24, 2019","Yes, Yes, Yes!",7,"Lafayette, Louisiana",5

Painted Desert,"We completed a round trip of fractionally under 400 miles to visit the Petrified Forest/Painted Desert NP but it was worth it.Probably the things most worth knowing are that the southern entrance to the Park is best for the Petrified Forest aspect while the northern part of the Park offers more to do with the Painted Desert.It also seems worth pointing out that the Visitor Centre by the northern entrance is much better equipped for those in need of gifts or refreshment than it’s southern counterpart. It also includes a small petrol station where they actually don’t try and rip off those in need of fuel.We travelled south to north simply because we wanted easy access to Route 40 at the end but for those most interested in examples of the Petrified Forest then Rainbow Forest behind the southern visitor centre is possibly as good as it gets and don’t expect upright ‘trees’, these are all fallen but fascinating and beautiful none the less.The landscape itself is both mysterious and desolate and reminded us very much of Death Valley but on a much more manageable scale.","April 4, 2019",Two for the price of one.,223,"Ashbourne, United Kingdom",4
Painted Desert,"Recently visited this area of Arizona and found it to be breathtaking. The colors and rock formations were truly inspiring and imaginative. Spent the whole day going to each point of interest and hiked all the areas that were available for the public. Pictures have turned out incredible.

Painted Desert,"Petrified Forest National Monument gives you two experiences in one -- the Petrified Forest AND a portion of the Painted Desert. The best Painted Desert viewing is in the north end of the park, with some unusual and beautiful scenery. You'll see petrified wood throughout the park, but the best Petriried Forest viewing is in the southern end of the park, especially near the Visitor Center, where there are two relatively short trails with lots of petrified logs to be seen. Be sure to walk the ""Giant Logs Trail"" to see the largest intact petrified trees. The Visitor Center has a good museum area that explains how these logs became petrified, starting 235 million years ago when when they were buried in silt during a flood. Over time, as silica replaced a tree's organic material, it turns into stone, or ""petrified wood"", as we know it. The Visitor Center also includes a 20-minute film along with displays of some dinosaur skeletons found in the park. It'll take you about 1.5 hours to go through the park, including stopping at the museum and walking the trails.

There were a fair amount of car and people traffic at the places we chose to stop at, but I had the most amazing opportunity to be totally alone at the fourth pull-out along the Blue Mesa loop.

(As well, if you're in the park, swing over to Winslow to check out who's ""standing on a corner in Winslow, AZ."") This is a great leisurely driving park that lacks the hordes of crowds many of the others are struck with. Views for miles and warm colors blending with nature as far as the eye can see. Stop at the old Harvey House, the Painted Desert Inn, and step around the back for the view. Red, blue, orange rippling mounds and lands for miles. Takes your breath away.

To see the vast expanse of the layered coloured rocks stretching to the horizon is spectacular. Then you have the chance to see up close the millions of years old petrified trees, with the coloured rock deposited in beautiful coloured rings where the wood used to be. It gives you a real sense of the history of the earth, the geological wonders that have taken place long before we were here and will continue long after. It really puts things in perspective and gives you a new found appreciation of the planet.

Painted Desert,Allow yourself some time here and enjoy the views. Be sure to check out the visitors center and get the history. Talk to a ranger and get the amazing details. Take a good camera and maybe a selfie stick for your phone pics. Don't forget to pic up a map to check out the view points. Do NOT pic up any rocks!

Painted Desert,"Only had 1.5 hours before closing and the ranger at the north entrance visitor center (Exit 311, I-40) suggested two spots to visit. One was about three miles out and displayed the reds and oranges of the desert, and one was about 15 miles out with blues and violets. You can spot petrified wood at many locations along the way. Wish we could have spent some more time hiking at the 15-mile spot, but had to turn back.","April 12, 2018","Just like the Grand Canyon,the Vistas are Unreal",72,"Coarsegold, California",5
Painted Desert,"Loved the colorful sediments exposed in this area. So beautiful when the lighting is right. You can see why artists have been so taken with the Painted Desert. We did the walk from Tawa point to the Painted Desert Inn. It was easy and very pretty. We wish that we had time to hike down to Onyx Bridge and to see if there were other possible short hikes within that part of the park.

Painted Desert,"We entered the south side of the park from Phoenix. Many people had tried to dissuade us from making a long drive, but as we are from the eastern US, a longer drive (3hours from Scottsdale) doesn't really bother us much. My kids both significantly preferred it over the Grand Canyon because it is much less commercial. I am not sure I would agree with that assessment, but would agree it is a don't miss. I loved the petrified forest and the huge remnants of another time. The painted desert was much like the Dakota badlands. The hides are generally fairly easy. One thing that is unexpected is that the gift shops and such are very reasonably priced. Park admission is $20 for a car, but is a bargain. We really enjoyed it and you can get both attraction is on a day.","April 1, 2018",Loved Painted Desert / Petrified Forest,26,"Roanoke, Virginia",5
Painted Desert,"We did the entire petrified forest tour. What stood out to me was how amazing the views of the painted desert were. The colors and how the sun brings it out on a clear day is so hard to describe. The park itself is incredibly maintained.

One of the best views is behind the Painted Desert Inn (there are restrooms downstairs). Picnic areas available. Several stop off points in close proximity whether traveling South to or North from the Pertrified Forest portion of the easily traveled 28 mile drive. We visited mid afternoon, but I am certain that on a clear day, sunsets must be amazing. Admission was $20 per vehicle.","March 22, 2018",Breathtaking and stunning!,81,,5
Painted Desert,"I’m going to be honest, this was something my husband was more excited about than I was but I am SO glad we went. I loved every minute of it. We started at the south entrance which is the entrance with the Visitor’s Center for the Petrified Forest. We worked our way north from there to the Visitor’s Center at the North entrance. It was a wonderful leisurely drive...about 27 miles worth. We got out of the car a lot at different points of interest and we really enjoyed all the history that we were exposed to. The scenery is wonderful. For us, the Blue Mesa was the highlight of our trip. We walked down to it and did the paved walk around...just gorgeous! It was very peaceful and I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that we went during off season. Highly recommend!","March 15, 2018",This is a must see!,13,,5
Painted Desert,"This section of the Petrified Forest National Park might have been a short drive but it took a long time to get through with my pulling the car over to take pictures and otherwise stare in awe of the beautiful colors in this desert landscape. I think the admission to the national park was $20 and worth it. [TIP:my receipt was later able to be applied toward an annual pass after racking up several National Park entrance fees that week!]. There was a nice little museum in what used to be the Painted Desert Inn. There's a public bathroom in there, too! too. It wasn't crowded at all when I was driving through, and I definitely recommend trying to visit when there aren't too many people, especially kids making a racket. This is a truly exhilarating place in our world. Petroglyphs, ruins from ancient Native civilizations, the petrified remains of trees, that existed in the time of dinosaurs! And just stellar desert landscaping and western skies that go on for ages!

Painted Desert,"On the way to Sedona from Chinle and the Canyon de Chelly, we decided to drive through the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest. We came down 191 to I-40 and entered the park from the north and drove the length of the Petrified Forest Road. The Painted Desert is an amazing blend of the tortured landscape and fascinating colour of the Chinle formation. I was fascinated by the first mudstone I had ever seen, particularly at ""the Teepees"". We ambled through the desert stopping at many of the outlooks, then stopped at the Agate Bridge which is a fascinating bridge created by a huge petrified log that has been unearthed from the mudstone and undercut by modern day rains and floods. Our next stop was the Crystal Forest which is a large area of petrified forest. The fossils are fascinating in that they look just like cut logs, but feel like stone. We walked the trail through the Crystal Forest marveling at the landscape and the petrified logs. We stopped in the museum/giftshop for a half hour or so, then drove on to Highway 180 and back toward Flagstaff.

As the sun moves around and the cloud cover changes so do the colours of the desert.....how I wish I had a good camera!The views are awesome and because it was in the fall there were only a few visitors and we were able to stop anywhere along the trail without any trouble. If you park your car and walk around the short trails the experience is even better.The desert moves on to the petrified forest where you can see wood millions of years old which has turned into a kind of multi coloured marble which is really fascinating.Definitely don't miss this park!!!......you enter from the I40 and drive the 25 miles or so through the painted desert and petrified forest and emerge on the 180 which quickly takes you back to the I40 or turn around and come back.,"September 17, 2017",Fantastic,148,"Stockton-on-Tees, United Kingdom",5

Painted Desert,"We did a day trip here from Phoenix and enjoyed our visit. We spent a good 7 hours at the park and easily could of spent more time. I brought my 4 boys (10,10,8 and 2) and we had a blast. Kids enjoyed doing the junior ranger programs and seeing the cool rocks! We started out at the Painted Desert Visitor center and then did our jr ranger program books as we drove through and stopped at the pull overs. We struggled with the booklets and I highly suggest starting at the Rainbow Forest museum and visitor center as you can do a lot of the booklet in there and your answers are in there. The way we started there wasn't displays or such at the painted desert visitor center and we had to look most of it up on the phones (I did get 4g throughout the park) . I like when the kids can search , read and find their own answers in displays and centers around them. I love that this park has the water bottle refill stations, I think I counted 3 or 4 of them around the park. Start at one end and drive through to the other. We only hiked one little trail, but did stop at all the pull overs and let the kids run around and see what there is to see. We only saw two rangers throughout the entire park which was odd, even the guy doing out jr ranger pledge at the end wasn't a ranger. Even with others around it seemed we had the park to ourselves which was NICE! Deff a great place to visit and take the family, we all enjoyed ourselves.","August 27, 2017",Great park!,25,,5
Painted Desert,"There are two ways into the Painted Desert. The 28 mile stretch starts either from the Petrified Forest entrance off 180 or if you are on 40 you can enter from the Painted Desert. Once you are in the park one will lead to the other. We arrived at four in the afternoon. Our trip through the National park took us about three hours with plenty of stops along the way. When you get to the Desert Inn be sure to stop and walk around. The Sunset in the Painted Desert is something you should not miss. Because of it's beauty, we decided to stop back on our trip back to Phoenix; it was much earlier in the day. The colors were awesome! The Painted Desert is about 2 miles long before entering the Petrified Forest. You have to do the whole length to catch up with 40 (28 miles). We turned around and caught 40. The Petrified Forest is interesting because of the history of the formation of the trees that seem to have turned to stone. Lots to read when stopping off at different sections. We missed the Pueblo engravings and walking on some of the trails. Something to do next trip. ","August 17, 2017",Vistas with lots of colors,26,"Long Island, New York",5

Painted Desert,We spent a most enjoyable day visiting Petrified Forest National Park which includes the Painted Desert. The Forest side is a genuine wonder especially when you realize that the area was once a tropical rain forest and sat at about the latitude of Costa Rica ! A quick stop at the info center will give you this overview and prepare you for the wonders ahead.

Painted Desert,One of the greatest joys of the Painted Desert (and Petrified Forest) is that it never appears to be crowded. For us it is absolutely wonderful to be able to drive through with our big rig (60' truck and fifth wheel). There is plenty of space allowing us to visit whilst on our way through Arizona heading west. The Painted Desert is just off of I40 so very accessible. You then carry on the road to the Petrified Forest and all that that has to offer. The park map is very legible and informational. The road is approximately 28 miles long with many turn offs. Once at the end if you want to return to I40 just follow the road to Holbrook. This park is suitable for all ages.,"August 7, 2017",VERY big rig accessible!,58,"Branson, Missouri",5

Painted Desert,"If you love amazing vistas and you have a couple of hours in the area of Winslow, Arizona, please do yourself a favor and visit Petrified Forest National Park. The park encompasses the Petrified Forest and also the Painted Desert really two attractions in one.Ever since I was a little boy I have wanted to visit the Petrified Forest. From the first time I read about trees turning to stone I was enchanted. Petrified Forest National Park includes tens of thousands of petrified trees that are incredibly multi colored and the many hues and shapes are amazing. There are trails where you can easily walk among the petrified wood, touch them, and marvel at the manner in which Mother Nature Works. The trails are mostly level, paved or gravelled and easy.The northern entrance to the park off of I-40 is the easiest access to the Painted Desert area. The vistas are absolutely breathtaking. I have been to most of the national parks and the vistas of the Painted Desert are a must see. Most of the rim trails are very easy and access is open and readily available. The southern entrance to the park off of Route 180, I believe, in Arizona is the best access to the Petrified Forest. Either way, you win.","July 8, 2017",Please Visit Petrified Forest/Painted Desert National Park,101,"Carmel, New York, United States",5

We have been before and know how spectacular the colours are but in the dull cloudy day we would probably not have stayed long. As it is we drove around for about an hour and by the time we were ready to go the sun finally broke through for a short period. It totally transformed the vista, not only with great colours but also greater depth to the view. Probably made it even better as it was quite drab earlier.

The National Parks Pass was able to be used and we were inside the park in no time. Following the road we came to a few pull over stops and was able to get out and take some pictures. Pictures we had seen made the colors looked more vibrant. We continues on to the Inn built in 1924 and purchased by the parks services in 1936. During WWII it was briefly closed. The Inn was almost torn down but was saved at the last second. The park has a visiting artist that stays across the way and has some items to purchase and the artists change often. They are in the process of making the downstairs an area to buy ice cream.

There is the ranger station and a small gift shop/mini museum at the Painted Desert entrance. There is a very good restaurant as well. I recommend the chile dog. It's local red chile with a Nathan's hot dog. Do not mistake this for ""chili."". It's much better. The staff is taciturn, but it's largely cultural. The onion rings are also very good.The drive through the park doesn't take too long, but it is long and winding. Stop at every turn out. There is so much to see and many pictures waiting to be taken.There is the old inn at the park. The docents bring in old china and dishes and there's photographs and furniture. The inn is cool and comfortable. It has a very old Route 66 vibe and is built from petrified wood. The history is of the inn and the photos is wonderful, but you can't stay there.Further down the road, there is a rest area just north of I-40. Please stop.there is a short walk with an archaeological dig of a village with plans and some very nice pictographs. There is also a local crow who likes people. He will get fairly close. Please make sure you feed him only good foods. He is rather a love and we'd like to have him around for a long time.As you drive you will see a lot of varied topography.

Other recommended hikes were Puerco Pueblo (simple introduction to Pueblo life), Blue Mesa (felt otherworldly like you were on another planet - unusual geology), and the Rainbow Forest Museum (nice dinosaur exhibit) and a walk through the Giant Logs in the back. This is a ""must see"" park!","April 27, 2017",Incredible scenery and many easy walks,13,"Austin, Texas",5

We did not do any of the hikes on this section because we were tired and had already walked about 8 miles that day so we only stopped at the various places in our car and got out to take pictures but it was still worth it. LOVE this place.,"April 19, 2017",Beautiful,79,"Boone, North Carolina",5
Painted Desert,We visited this park the day before we went to the Grand Canyon. It was $20 a car. You can drive to each spot and walk a small amount to get to the areas.

Painted Desert,"We started on the South end and enjoyed the Petrified Forest first. I have an older vintage ring of petrified wood, probably from the 50's or 60's. I always wondered about it, but never thought I would be able to visit a National Park where I could see and learn much more about. Now I think that is where the ring probably originally came from, maybe a gift shop in the area or ?? I really enjoyed this part of the park. It really is fascinating to look very closeup to the pieces scattered here and there. You look at it and say, this was wood, now it is a gemstone! I enjoyed the landscape. It is different, sometimes in an almost eery way. But you must see it to appreciate the works of nature's art.So as you drive on, you start to enter the other part, the Painted Desert. I loved how the landscape blends, but changes ever so gently and you want to stop so you can savor this feast for the eyes! We visited in January, and we were lucky to have a pretty nice day, overall, but I've heard it gets pretty hot in the summer, so probably spring or fall might be good. Also, if you have a good lens camera, where you might want to focus in, bring that or binoculars. You will enjoy that, because a lot of views are distant. Now go and enjoy!","April 11, 2017","Two parks, really, for the price of one!",368,"Lemont, Illinois",5

Painted Desert,We were rather disappointed with the painted desert. The coloured cliffs are not especially interesting with only red and white to be seen. There are far more spectacular views of coloured cliffs elsewhere in Arizona. We would not have bothered except that the painted desert is continuation of the Petrified Forest National Park and therefore covered by the same fee.,"April 9, 2017",Rather disappointed,550,"Derby, United Kingdom",3

I could see distinct patterns in the scenery but no real standout colors. further down the road I could see on the Buttes clearly defined lines and better colors, although this is not technically the painted desert. Oh by the way, buy your lifetime pass ASAP before the Congressional price increase hits, It's a pretty drastic rise in price. Gee thanks, I get to pay an exorbitant price to see a park I already own!!!!! The plus side is that the pass covers a group of 4 I think so only one will be needed per family.

Enter from the South gate, go to the museum/visitors center, and then drive the distance to the North gate. Stop at every point of interest and enjoy each part of this natural wonder. Every mile boasts a new vista, color, and formation. I went there as a day trip from Sedona--totally do-able, still allotting plenty of time to see the whole park. Pack a lunch and stop and any point to eat. April weather was perfect, but still intense sun (remember you are at high elevation) so pack the sunscreen. If you go any later, be prepared for the heat. There is no shade in any part of the park.","April 7, 2017",WOW!!,34,"Atlanta, Georgia",5

The colours are beyond description: layers of volcanic action and erosion have sculpted an abstraction. The stillness of the desert make this contemplative place where time can disappear. The didactics and pullouts make exploration safe and accessible. We simply did not have enough time to take it all, and we did not want to miss a thing. I would come back here again and again.

It turned out working out perfectly for us. We were able to do all the activities and by the time we got to the North entrance the kids were hungry and the cafeteria there was clean and reasonable. The kids did the junior ranger activities and we took advantage of the table and chairs at the cafeteria to help them with their answers. They got sworn in by Park Ranger Mitt Walter and were super proud and happy to receive the patches. The process of petrification is very well explained in the short movie available at the Rainbow Museum. The basic trails are easy and paved. You can even take a wheelchair!

Painted Desert,"These two areas are amazing and, unlike many national parks, not crowded. The fact you can drive through the park and see most of its beauty is great for people with mobility problems, yet active people can head out on hikes to see more of the picturesque scenery.

It was really neat and there is a lot of really neat stuff in the shops and welcome centers. We drove through a little quicker than I would have liked because we had to be in another city at a certain time but it was still a wonderful experience, especially for my so who is a rock-hound.

Painted Desert,"The Painted Desert and Petrified Forest are really one destination. It is a 26-mile route, with many places to stop or take extra short loops by car or by foot.I recommend starting at the north entrance, just off I-40. You can watch a short film and get a map at the Visitors Centre, which will show all the places worth stopping. Once you start the 26-mile route, it's nonstop with exit until the end. This is not a big deal, but good to know for planning food and drink needs. There are bathrooms along the route. When you're done, it's an additional 18-mile trip back to Holbrook where there are lots of shops selling petrified wood and other souvenirs, plus restaurants and hotels.The actual route is amazing! It's a quiet drive, with lots of desert in all directions. Many opportunities for photos, and the colours and shadows are different at various times of day.Blue Mesa is probably one of the best stops - well worth the extra 3-mile loop to drive into, and then a 3-km path to walk through it. It's a paved path, so strollers and wheelchairs could do it, but note that there are some steep grades and sharp curves. It's an easy walk downhill, but what goes down must go up again, so be aware of that if you have walking issues.Lots of petrified wood here that you can see up close. Some look like someone was chopping firewood, it looks so much like freshly axed logs. Also many opportunities for beautiful photos.Through the route, be sure to read the plaques to learn about what you're seeing.

Painted Desert,"Enjoyed a quick drive through the Petrified Forest National Park on our way to Holbrook after leaving in early morning from the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta.Used our America annual parks pass (otherwise $20 entrance fee per car). Arrived at the Painted Forest Visitor Center and watch a short film about the site before we started our drive. As it was midday and I was feeling a bit tired from the Fiesta, I didn't want to do much hiking in the heat so ended up mostly stopping at each point of interest to take a few photos and moving on. The only exceptions were the Blue Mesa and Crystal Forest. I thought the former was the best place to see the different layers of sediment which seemed to create a rather alien landscape. The Crystal Forest had a short loop walk through a fascinating scatter of ancient wood trunks turned mineral rock over a number of hills. This area, as with the others, is unshaded so I would definitely advise a hat. There was a good breeze when I visited so it would be easy to get sunburnt without noticing.Overall an interesting side trip, well recommended if you are in the area.","October 5, 2016",Fascinating landscape,87,"London, United Kingdom",4
Painted Desert,"The Painted Desert appeared from nowhere and what a pleasant surprise it was. There are numerous viewpoints along the drive to stop and take many photographs.

Highly recommend.","October 4, 2016",Amazing Colours,84,"Queensland, Australia",5
Painted Desert,"If you are interested in geology, dinosaurs, and/or human history, this is a nice place to visit. Easy drive, lots of pullouts. It might be a bit warm in high summer and cold in winter, but late May/early June was perfect. The big trees are, of course, the major attraction. So many and so huge. Easy trails, some even paved. Also a chance to see some wildlife. We saw our first wild bighorn sheep (wearing a radio tracking collar) walking along the road, mule deer, lots of birds and various small lizards. Kids would especially enjoy this, but we old kids liked it too.","October 1, 2016","Great scenery, history and prehistory",27,"Mesa, Arizona",5

Turned out an an early visit was best. We drove the 28-mile road and enjoyed the beautiful scenes of the desert. Road is perfectly paved, big improvement from a visit years ago. Visitor Center is grand, has indoor plumbing. Go before you go! We have the senior Park pass so avoided the $25 entry fee.

Although i stopped for curiosity and I was absolutely tired of riding in the truck, I was amazed at what I saw. Turns out the park is a several hour to day trip to really enjoy it or if you want to do any of the hiking. My curiosity turned into a 6 hour delay on my route but it was so beautiful and mind boggling.There are 10 main stops along the park road. If you start on the I-40 end you will start with the beauty of the painted desert and work down towards the petrified forest area.About 1/3 of the way you can sit on the route 66 bench and then cross the Sante Fe Railroad (or visa versa depending on direction)The park is super clean, nice rangers, and quite a few facilities and places to fill up a water bottle.","September 18, 2016","If you don't think a desert can be beautiful, come here!",80,"Waikoloa, Hawaii",5

With the time change, we made it to the park an hour before closing and still got to see everything we wanted to see.Even though we were on a time restraint, the park is small enough to enjoy the scenic drive through it and stop at all the scenic points. We were there at sunset which was the perfect time to take in all the colors of The Painted Desert.

The painted desert (north of the park) especially so. It's $20 for a whole park ticket and you get to see everything.

The weather was extremely warm the day we visited, but we managed to walk the Crystal Forest and Giant Logs Trails. I would have loved to hike the mile-long Blue Mesa Trail, but it was getting later in the day and pretty warm, so we drove through instead. It was a gorgeous drive. The trees were amazing; the petrified wood is like rock, and some of it actually glistens. Had it been cooler, I would definitely want to try most of the trails here. Many were paved and easily navigated. The scenery here reminded me of another one of my favorite parks: The Badlands of South Dakota. I am hopeful that we can return some day during cooler weather.

At the end of the drive prior to the exit (route 180), there is a petrified trees ""garden"", where you can get up close to some amazing petrified trees.

At the gift shop you can buy some petrified rock samples and other tourist trap stuff. Some of the prices, especially on the rock, beat the local tourist trap stores. Then you drive through the park (fee based, if you have anyone over 60 you can get a year pass for $10 which gets a carload in any national park for that one time fee). You go through the painted desert first. It's truly amazing what God has created! You also realize how small we really are in comparison. The one road leads you through various stops and picture opportunities. Then you will cross under I-40 on your way to the Petrified Forest and more stops.

This park is long and narrow. The blacktop was fresh and smooth, but there were few places to pull over, and even fewer trailheads. So many gorgeous sights, but it was getting late and we were worried about slowing down what little traffic there was by stopping on the narrow road. Apparently nice hikes exist, but 100° heat kept us close to the car. Do visit the quaint gas station and shop just outside the north gate.

Painted Desert,"The painted desert and the petrified forest are basically one and the same. Entering from the North stop by the visitor center to get oriented. Then enter the park by car, pay your fee, and you're on you're way. As you drive the 30 mile road from North to South you will have several opportunities to pull over and get out of the car to enjoy some incredible vistas. Be sute to stop at the old pueblo inn, which is now a museum, basically the inn frozen in time, and very interesting; it's a 15 minute thing. Your main event is just before you exit the National Park. Pull into the lot for the South visitor's center and park. You have two excellent options for seeing incredible petrified wood. Before you and up onthe ridge are ""Giant Logs."" An easy walk, and where most people go. Behind you, and a short walk, 1/2 mile back over the bridge is the trail head for ""Long Logs."" This 2-3 mile loop is for those who want to walk further. This is an area that was flooded 210 million years ago. Trees were swept into the area creating a log jam. When the waters receeded the trees were covered in sediments and then the organic material crystalized and ""petrified"" into stone. Hence, you are walking through an ancient log jam. Visit the Agate House, one of hundreds of structures built in the area so etime between 1100 and 1300. Walk among the longest petrified wood logs you'll ever see. It is amazing. NOTE: The walk is easy and 75% of the trail and loops are paved. Yes, bring a bottle of water, it is hot and arrid, but you are VERY close to civilization as at all times you can see where the guest center is and where you parked. When you leave, stop at the gift store as they sell some beautiful polished pieces of petrified wood at prices considerable lower than the tourist trap just outside the exit.

Google Maps gave us directions to what would turn out to be the Painted Desert Visitor Center. However, before we got there, we saw a sign for the Petrified Forest NP. Needless to say, we were very confused. When we got to the Painted Desert Visitor Center, we discovered that the previous sign would have taken us onto Rt. 180, then into the Petrified Forest Park, and a 25 or so mile through scrubland drive up to where we were (think of it as a triangle). Needless to say, we were more than a little frustrated.

It is longer and one does have to loop back into Holbrook to get back to the interstate, but what's another 20 miles. The Petrified Forest is a wonder to see.

It takes a while to stop, view each overlook/marked post, take photos and even walk through the trails, some are basic and others are serious hiking paths.

There is lots to see and touch as you walk around. If tempted to take home some please be aware that not only is there a very stiff penalty and you are ruining a national treasure, it is totally unnecessary as there are two stores right outside the south exit with lots of privately owned and excited wood for sale.

I was greeted by two beautiful and talkative ravens as I entered the park. They will become art as SOON as I have the time. I was flabbergasted by Newspaper Rock, although saddened by how far they had to keep the tourists away (MUST be done, but still sad)The trees were pretty spectacular. I know, if you are not INTO trees made of rocks, it may not be your cup of tea, but they are much more amazing in person... and NO they are not standing up... they have fallen down. Just to be clear. When I was rounding the hill out of the Crystal Forest a seriously majestic lone Bighorn Ram was atop a ridge and I got out the zoom and snapped all I could. Traffic and I were stopped and slowed and it was such an amazing opportunity!Then, driving up to Colorado three times this year, I was missing the pronghorn or antelope of my youth. I had not seen them at all. Within sight of the gate, three of them were blending into the grassland. I must have gotten 40 or so shots and came home laden with photos for paintings. I was happier with this trip than I would have been to actually encounter Duke Mantee!!!!","June 6, 2016",Mother nature smacked me in the face! More than trees made of rocks.,16,"Mesa, Arizona",5
Painted Desert,"You can see both the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert in the same stop. If you enter the park in The Petrified Forest end, you will drive through and end up in the Painted Desert. And vice versa. There is only 1 admission charge. We took about 2 hours to drive through and explore the parks. That included us getting out at the different lookout points and doing several of the hikes. You could definitely drive through it faster if you don't stop at every lookout or do any of the hiking. You could also spend quite a bit longer if you want. Our favorite stop was the Blue Mesa trail. It's rather steep at the beginning and you definitely need to be able-bodied to do it. Once you get down the steep incline, there are just gentle rolling hills that take you in a loop prior to the steep ascent back up to the top. It was in risibly beautiful and really neat to be so close to the mesas. Make sure you go either early morning or later evening time to get the best colors and most pleasant temperatures if touring in summer months. Check the park schedule for opening/closing times depending on time of year. We went in the evening from 5:45-7:45 and saw gorgeous different colorings on the rocks. If you go in the middle of the day when the sun is high in the sky, people say the color is washed out. The rocks aren't as interesting to look at and don't have as many of the different shades of blues and pinks, etc. Would definitely recommend doing this before the Grand Canyon if you plan to do both. We were really able to appreciate the beauty of this park prior to going and being blown away by the grandness of the Grand Canyon. ","June 5, 2016",Incredible Beauty!,9,"Newbury Park, California",5

There are lots of hiking trails throughout the area. The information that is available in the park office is astounding. Knowing that sea fossils have been found in the area is confusing until you look at the displays and find that what is today Arizona was once, billions of years ago, on the equator. Due to the continental shifting over the years we are able to see things that would never have been possible. Don't miss out on the petrified forest if you are even close.

Painted Desert,"My husband and I have passed signage for the Petrified Forest National Park several times over the last many years while traveling Route 66 or just going West in general. As a child of the 70's I recall my grandmother going on and on about the Petrified Forest and the Painted Desert and having to look at her photo album, pages upon pages of photographs taken with her Kodac 110 camera -- boring, one-dimensional, washed-out vistas that all looked the same despite her insistence they were taken in different areas of the park. She even had small pieces of petrified wood in her curio cabinet which were only slightly more interesting. I suppose I was of the opinion that I had experienced enough of the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert through grandma's photographs and mementos as well as looking out of my car window while traveling 75 mph on I-40. Recently, however, my husband and I found ourselves approaching Holbrook, our planned destination for the evening, around mid-afternoon and and decided ""why not?"". In retrospect, I wonder whether my new openness to this experience was largely driven by my need to pay homage to my grandmother who died a few years ago. At any rate, the Petrifed Forest National Park is approximately 28 miles of newly paved road, bisected by I-40, with twelve designated points of interest and accessible walking trails of scenic overlooks ranging from a quarter of a mile to two miles. Many of these points of interest have restrooms. We chose to enter from the North, or the Painted Desert end, and travel southward to the Petrified Forest area which dumped us out on a secondary highway to Holbrook. Needless to say, Grandma's Kodac 110 camera did not do adequate justice to the beautiful landscapes, including the magnificent ""John Ford"" clouds, and we got much better photographs with my husband's higher-end camera. And yes, we could have probably seen similar views from our car on the Interstate while flying by at 75 mph, but not in a mindful way, and at our own leisure. We particularly enjoyed the scenic walks at the Painted Desert and Blue Mesa points of interest which allowed us to get our FitBIt steps for the day. We saw lizards, ground squirrels and what was either a deer or an antelope (my husband and I still disagree!). I recommend bringing sunscreen and water. Also, it occurs to me that some children and/or teenagers may find this park slow-paced and boring, but then again, why else do they have electronics? In all, we spent a very enjoyable two-three hours slowly snaking our way through the park and now have beautiful, new photographs to display from our iPhones. Thank you, Grandma.","June 3, 2016",Cinematic Views,66,Texas,4
Painted Desert,"Petrified Forest National Park has two sections: the bottom half is devoted to the story of the petrified wood and the top half is the Painted Dessert. The park drive is approximately 26 miles. We entered the park from the south entrance and would suggest starting from the north side if there is any chance that the clouds will come in during the day. The colors of the painted desert become muted with the clouds in the afternoon. The views from the Painted Desert Inn and adjoining look outs showcase a lot of red and pinks but the Blue Mesa area was astounding to see. We hit the petroglyphs at Newspaper Rock, Puerco Pueblo, Agate Bridge and all the rest of the stops through the park.The most amazing part of the park is the southern area with all the Petrified logs. It is amazing to realize that 200+ million years ago Arizona was a tropical lush rain forest located where Costa Rica is today. The story of how the trees fell into the streams and turned to stone is amazing. Visit the Rainbow Forest center and walk the many trails in the southern section to see all the examples of petrified logs.","June 3, 2016",Millions of Years in the Making,27,"Ludlow, Massachusetts",5

Painted Desert,"This outstanding natural phenomenon is a neighbour to the Petrified Forest which it abuts, so you can ""do"" two great features immediately after the other. The best way to start to understand and appreciate this natural phenomenon is at the Visitor Center, a modern, spacious, well-appointed (and well-stocked!) information center which houses, amonmg other things, a Museum, gift shop, bathrooms, and the inevitable tourist memorabilia but, surprisingly (to me, anyway) of high quality and reasonable prices. But you come to see the Desert, and what makes it apinted: all the various colours which time, wind, water and erosion have made in to a wondrous palette of different colours. Each time you come around a bend there is another vista of something different from the previous one. We have phenomena similar to this one in the remoter noerth-west of Australia, but the outstanding feautre of this one in the United States is that it's all squeezed in to an area that is really quite compact. The walking trails are well signposted, the driving is easy and you'll be rewarded at just about every twist and turn in the road with yet another marvel of nature.","June 1, 2016",Words alone could not do it justice!,492,"Gold Coast, Australia",5

After all, we, too, have semi-arid areas in our island continent (the same size as the continental United States) which equal or, (ahem!), are better than, e.g. the Painted Desert, but the adjoining Petrified Forest just blew me away! The scenery, of course, is hugely impressive, but to see such an amount of beautifully preserved ancient, fossilised logs scattered in profusion all around was, for me, a unique experience. And the ever-helpful National Parks Service provide you with a detailed map, informative background detail and interesting photgraphs from yesteryear showing how, even way back then, this natural feature was a tourist attraction of great interest.

It was really beautiful, and I wish we had more time than the 5 hours we spent there. It is definitely worth spend a whole there.My girls did the Junior Ranger program at the park which gives them a strong understanding of nature and what they are seeing.

If you can get to the park in the early morning (before 9 am) and walk the Blue Mesa Loop, then you will have a very rewarding experience.

Painted Desert,"Petrified Forest Nat'l Park really has two parts the bottom half is filled with petrified wood and the top half is the Painted Dessert. How petrification occurs the fact that trees 225 million years ago were buried in silt and that as the wood cells decayed water heavy with dissolved silicate replaced the wood combined with oxygen and crystalized to form quartz is fascinating. Quartz is white but it is other minerals like hematite and amytyhyst that give the wood its color and beauty. If not for the frequent earthquakes, volcanoes and colision of the NOrth American and Pacific plates the Chinle formation (230 million yrs old) would be buried like it is elsewhere. The story of how the collisions of these plates changed the latitude of this land from tropical and humid near Panama to its present location is fascinating. I suggest you do more than walk the brief paved walkin trails i.e Giant Logs, Crystal Forest, Blue Mesa. Allow at least 3 days here. Do the LOg Walks but also do the LOng Logs Agate House Walk visit Puerco Pueblo (Anazasi ruins) and Petroglyphs, Drive the Painted Desert part of the park.

This place can easily take an entire day IF you are not in a hurry and enjoy nature. We went a little over a week ago and the weather was great. A bit windy at times and a few small showers, but mostly nice. Not sure if this place would be too fun in the summer. There are a few places you can hike at and several photo spots to stop at.

There are a handful of overlooks on the Painted Desert side. The day we went was a clear bright sunny day and the colors looked fairly washed out. You can see similar views from outside the park. We only saw two or three other cars during our visit, so at least it wasn't crowded. There is a gift shop and more importantly a gas station at the North visitors center.

Painted Desert,"We entered through the South side, and drove along all the lookout points. It is a fascinating picture of shades of red, pink, yellow, gray and black. A picture may be worth a 1000 words, but these tell stories from millions of years. Although most are great, our favourite was the very last one, just before one exits from the North side to I-40.","May 12, 2016",There are several views...But the last (close to North side) is the Best!,52,"Sugar Land, Texas",4
Painted Desert,"On a travel day from Gallup to Meteor Crater (near Winslow AZ) we stopped at the Petrified Forest National Park visitor's center in our 42 foot coach pulling a tow car. No problem finding parking and the entire park is dog friendly! Not very many vehicles in the lot.We entered the park off I-40 and once past the ranger station we were in The Painted Desert. This park is like Denali in Alaska, only one road so impossible to get lost! We stopped and parked at many scenic turn outs (avoiding Agate Bridge and Pintado Point as there wasn't enough room for us to turn around). There are many walking trails and we stopped and walked to he Puerco Pueblo ancient dwellings. It's a marvel that so much of the 100 room pueblo arranged around a central courtyard remained! Lots of petroglyphs too!We walked around Jasper Forest, the beginning of the petrified trees. There were some fallen logs that must have been 80' long! The best stop was our last, at the Giant Logs! Wow! The hiking trail was to the right side of the Rainbow Forest Museum. So many logs and one with roots! There were colorful pieces of petrified wood, one resembled a melted candle.This was the best ever park visit with a big RV and a dog! The vistas were magnificent and I learned much why the logs look as if they've been cut in regular sections (they haven't, the hill does it!!)

Painted Desert,"I would definitely recommend this self guided drive. It was really beautiful and the gift shop had a lot of affordable stuff as well. But the beauty of Arizona can not be beat. Also, we purchased senior citizen passes good for all parks for $10 and it allows entrance to parks for the whole car. Since most everything can be seen from the car or from short walks, it would be easily done by small children, people who can't walk long distances and people in wheelchairs.","May 12, 2016",Painted Desert,11,"High Ridge, MO",5

Painted Desert,"One of the smaller National Parks and lacks the dramatic scenery of most of the other parks in this amazing region. However, it makes a interesting change from staring into vast canyons or gazing at amazing rock formations. This is a more intimate experience which offers both the scenery of the pastel coloured rocks of the PaintedDesert in the northern section and the curiosity of petrified logs and tree trunks strewn across this high desert region. The easy trails allow you to get right among these remains of a once tropical forest and appreciate their texture and coloured there is an informative Visitor Centre at the northern entrance and a fascinating museum at the southern end, with dinosaur exhibits (they once roamed this area) and information boards about the formation of the petrified wood.

We got lucky by coincidence that we did not have to pay admission that day. We did not expect it to be so large and did not plan for it to be that extraordinary so we're planning on coming back one day to really spend some time here including walking some of the trails and visiting the museum and gift shop on the grounds.

Painted Desert,"Visited this place on the way to Vegas (driving from Austin). It is just off of I-40 (< 1 mile) and has appx 28mile loop once you pay and enter the national park.Most of it is desert badlands but there are good view points along the way. It kind of reminded me of joshua tree, death valley etc combined together.There are several hiking places but the one I liked best was the blue forest hiking trail. You walk down the canyon to the wasteland/bandlands and it is fantastic. it is a short trail and you get to see some amazing landscape. It has a very steep down walkway initially so might not be good for pregnant ladies or folks with difficult walking/climbing.Another good trail is the crystal forest where you get to see a lot of petrified trees. when I got here it suddenly started raining so was not able to complete the whole trail.overall, worth a visit for sure if you are travelling on I-40. Not sure if I would drive to this place to just see this but if you are in that area it is surely worth it.","May 4, 2016",Good 2 to 3 hr detour off of I-40...worth a visit...,21,"Austin, Texas",4
Painted Desert,"I stopped here as part of a circular tour of national parks in northern Arizona/Southern Utah and this was my last stop before heading back home to California. I recommend starting from the southern entrance off highway 180 and driving north through the park. I stopped at most of the pull-offs and scenic overlooks and also walked some of the shorter trails like Crystal Forest, Blue Mesa and Newspaper Rock. I then crossed over I-40 and briefly drove the north loop. I believe this is a sufficient way to experience the park and see all the major points of interest in approx. 2-3 hours. I recommend this park primarily because of the novelty of seeing so many petrified objects in one place which I’m assuming would be an unusual sight to most people. Otherwise, I don’t feel the park has much to offer beyond that so don’t go out of your way. Most of the drive between the specific stops was basic desert environment and fairly routine if you’ve previously seen this topography. Still, it was a nice, pleasant way to spend a spring afternoon and there’s no denying that the petrified wood was really cool.","May 3, 2016",Pleasant stop but of limited interest,212,California,4

There are several short and mainly ""easy"" hikes, all worth the effort, to see incredible landscape and petrified trees. Be sure to spend a few minutes in either the Rainbow Museum or the Visitor Center at the North entrance (just of I-40). You'll get an appreciation for what you're seeing throughout the part. The gift shops are pretty nice as well; well stocked and reasonably priced as well. A camera is a must and binoculars are good idea.

Painted Desert,"Spent only a hour or two at the petrified forest area and was of interesting enough but a bit overly manicured with concreted pathways. However we then headed to the Painted Desert area and did a three hour hike to the valley floor which was wonderful. We didn't see any other people the whole time we were there which made it feel very special. Lots of wildlife, birds of prey and lots of lovely jack rabbits all over the place . Strange rock formations in odd colours made this place feel like we were on the moon. Make sure you drop a Google map pin where you start as it's quite easy to get lost . take lots of water and sunscreen too. Would recommend very highly if you love really odd desert landscapes.

I stopped at almost every location to take some beautiful pictures (to come soon) and to read the informational signs. I really wish I could've spent more time looking at everything. I believe the entire park is 26 miles driving through- so make sure you have enough gas to get through! I recommend ending on the south side where the rainbow forest is located too.

Painted Desert,"This review is about the Painted Desert, near to Arckaringa Homestead.East of Cadney Homestead on the Stuart Highway in Central Australia is the Painted Desert. To get there it is about 90 km on a dirt road, which my satnav told me would take nearly 3 hours. The road was in good condition so it only took me 90 minutes each way, including a couple of photo stops. It is a very pretty area with crumbling mesas in many colours. Very remote, so be sure to take water in case of vehicle problems.Earlier in the day I had visited The Breakaways, near Coober Pedy. They are similar to the Painted Desert and much easier to get to.

All places were equally impressive and made you feel like walking on another planet. Beautiful views scattered with petrified logs in all shapes and sizes.

The Blue Mesa was my favorite stop, although the petrified wood, the carved rock, and the Route 66 car were pretty awesome too.","April 14, 2016",One of my favorite stops on our road trip,40,"Fremont, California",5
Painted Desert,Stopped here while killing time on a business trip. It was an interesting way to kill a couple of hours. The views of the Painted Desert were more interesting to me than the petrified wood. It's about a 28 mile trip through the park.

Painted Desert,"Who knew a desert could be this beautiful. This was an unexpected stop on our drive from Naples, FL to Los Angeles, CA. We got there shortly after sunset and spent most of our morning playing and and exploring this national forest. The Painted Desert was my favorite. I couldn't believe the colors. It wasn't crowded or super hot yet, so we took our time and looked around and just took in the incredible views. A must see","April 12, 2016",Beyond Words,44,"Sussex, Wisconsin",5

Painted Desert,"After starting in the Petrified Forest to the south, we continued on the road to the Painted Desert. The scenery was great and there are numerous places to pull over and take pictures. It was a little cloudy and the colors were slightly muted. It is my understanding that everything jumps out more on a sunny day, so you may want to keep that in mind. ","April 10, 2016",Great scenery,54,"Tacoma, Washington",4
Painted Desert,I haven't been to the Petrified Forest since I was a little kid. It was great to bring my family here for a visit. We started from the south side and worked our way north.

We spent a half day driving the road to the other end to the north enjoying the beauty. ,"April 10, 2016",Really enjoyed this,54,"Tacoma, Washington",5
Painted Desert,"We had toured years ago, but really enjoyed yesterday's visit. The weather was cool, the sky was mixed clouds, and the colors were really dramatic. We needed much more time to do more walks on established trails and plan to return. The Blue Mesa trail looked especially inviting, but it was already starting to get dark.The park was not crowded at this time of year and we had many viewing sites to ourselves, for very intimate experience. Signage and the pamplet guide/map are terrific. Our National Parks are wonderful!We entered from I-40, exited at the south end at dusk, and spent the night in Holbrook AZ. Four hours was definitely not enough time.","April 10, 2016",Really worth the time! Get out of the car and do the hikes!,84,Oaxaca,5
Painted Desert,An amazing place to visit and take photos. A wonder drive with stops to view the amazing colors.

They helped me with my passport stamps and gave me great advice about the park... they were awesome!We started driving through the park and to be honest I was kind of bored.... but then.... we came upon a 360 degree overlook that took my breath away. It was insane! I've never experienced a panoramic view like that in my life. I could have stayed there for hours! I was blown away.If you're traveling from Flagstaff to Albuquerque, this is an awesome way to travel!","April 8, 2016",Was pleasantly surprised!,6,"Denver, Colorado",4
Painted Desert,Easy access to the whole park without back tracking. Park personnel were very friendly and helpful. Almost every car in the parking lot was from a different state.

Painted Desert,It's hard to believe that this once had vegetation similar to Costa Rica. You definitely want to first stop at he Museum. The exhibits are edifying and the staff circulating among the visitors very knowledgeable. The area/trails behind seem to have the greatest deposit of petrified wood and are an easy level. (FYI The museums /gift shops at the entrance are commercial enterprises and not the actual Park museum which is a short distance past.) You will probably need more time than you allotted to see it all including the Painted Desert which you have to drive through to get back to the highway. The actual driving distance is considerable and there are various stops along the way that you will want to see and explore. I was very impressed!,"April 7, 2016",AWESOME,42,"Castle Rock, Colorado",5

There's so much history here and so many stops, each of them different. The Blue Mesa Badlands was probably my favorite from this visit and it's definitely worth getting out of the car and walking the trail. I love all the blues and grays of the mudstones. It's astonishing to learn that it's over 200+ million years old. Expect to spend at least half a day to a full day here.","April 3, 2016",A lot to see here,46,"West Covina, CA",4

We were not disappointed. The 40+ mile loop through the park should be taken in early morning or late afternoon to capitalize on the reds, brown, and green in the terrain. The petrified logs are mainly to the south of the park. I would advise entering in the northeast entrance and leave from the SW.

As it was, we managed to see quite a lot in that hour including some beautiful views as the sun started setting. While we didn't plan very well and got there late, our reward was some spectacular views of big sky, the Painted Desert with shadows and light, and a less crowded view of the petrified logs around the landscape.

If you plan ahead, you can see this park in one day.Recommend starting at the South entrance. From there stop at the museum which also is your chance to top off on water and take a restroom break.I stopped and visited each of the turnouts and the associated trails. Not all turnouts have trails. Most trails are paved so seniors not accustomed to hiking should be OK. The exception is the Blue Forrest Trail - that trail is steep and has many steps to it.There is some backcountry hiking opportunities in the wilderness area on the North End. BE ADVISED, that although the trail appears well marked next to the Painted Desert Inn, it's NOT MARKED or MAINTAINED. That's apparent once you drop into the canyon floor. Take a GPS or COMPASS with you. Cairns are NOT present. Also- don't follow others footprints - that could lead to trouble. Be prepared: I had my daypack, 3 liters of water, food and layers.

The park is amazing, for all ages. There were several handicap accessible walkways, but if one is capable of getting out and walking, some hikes are the best.

We by-passed the visitor center and showed the Ranger my National Park pass, where we recieved a map and headed out to the Painted Desert Loop. Out on the paved road there were places to pull off and take pictures, it was very peaceful and quiet. Not sure what I was expecting but there were mounds of painted rocks and if the sun hit just right they were brilliant. The Sun is an important part in all the scenery that you see in AZ. We stopped to take a photo at the old car and bumper that says Route 66 but i didn't see the road?? Traveling under 40 (there is not reentry to 40 at this point unless you turn around). The landscape started to change and I guess I was looking for alot of downed petrified trees, I didn't see alot unless they were hiking distance from the road.My wife found Newspaper Rock interesting and the Park is doing construction and repairing roads, but it was worth the time spent. We caught the sunset at the visitors center on the way out. NICE","March 21, 2016",Not what i thought,23,"Indianapolis, Indiana",3

I only say that, because we had a 5 hour drive plus 2 hours at the park with 2 teens and a toddler. We were exhausted by the end of the ride.

I am not sure what I expected but it was not the acres and acres of chunks of trees lying about the grounds. At first glance they all look pretty much the same and to really appreciate their color and individuality requires closely looking at them one by one. I lost interest fairly quickly. On a positive note we took the path (partly paved and partly loose surface) to visit Agate House. This is a ruins of a ancient structure of petrified wood built by the indigenous people. This is a great photo op! The last .1 mi+- of the path is not only not paved it is uphill as well. Sadly, I think a visitor using a wheelchair would do fine on the first part of the path but not the second so would not get much of a look at the ruins. The visitor center is very nice and has some grand fossils and models to look at. This building is accessible. Rt. 40 is under construction on the way out of the park area. We were warned about that on the way in but still were not expecting the 1/2 hour wait followed by a stretch of road that required one to use his/her off-road skills. Cost is not exorbitant.

Just off I-40 (part of the Old Route 66), it is one of the world's largest concentrated areas of petrified wood. The story of how wood was petrified is most interesting as it happened about 225 million years ago when a pine forest thrived in the area. Fierce volcanic activity buried the forest in ash, with silica turning the dead wood into stone. Be sure to look for a 1932 Studebaker marking where the old and revered Route 66 used to cross in the park. Though it's a rust bucket, it makes for an amazing photo op.","March 10, 2016",From Badlands and Tepees to Ancient Wood-turned-to-Stone,236,"Placitas, New Mexico",5

Painted Desert,"I spent most of today visiting this park. The painted desert area was beautiful, as was the Painted Desert Historic Inn. The Crystal Forest and the Blue Mesa are two short hikes that are well worth anyone's time.

Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest/Painted Desert was our Route 66 adventure from Flagstaff (approx. 100 miles). This drive features 180 degree wide open country with endless sky.I would recommend starting at the visitors center of the Petrified Forest. Walk the trails behind the center where you'll see some amazing vistas and the beautiful petrified trees. You can also walk the trail to the Agate House, a 700 year old pueblo built from petrified wood, from this parking lot. The road through the Petrified Forest N.P. has several stops which include Newspaper Rock and Jasper Forest. I highly recommend the trail through Blue Mesa which was one of our favorites trails.Continue along the road to the Painted Desert N.P., but make sure you stop for a picture at the antique car that sits on the original Route 66 that ran through the park.The Painted Desert N.P. is less interactive , so it's a great place to end and enjoy the views.On your way home make a stop in Holbrook to see Wigwam Motel & Curios (811 W Hopi Dr,), one of the last teepee motels and in Winslow to have your picture taken ""Standin on the Corner"" (100 E Second St). You'll also have an opportunity to see Route 66 as it stands today (the movie ""Cars"" was not exaggerating the sad condition of this road). Your ride back to Flagstaff will take you directly by Meteor Crater.The pass to the Petrified Forest includes the Painted Desert or use your America the Beautiful Pass to access these National Parks. Our family includes three 19 to 22 year old girls who loved the two parks and the Route 66 attractions.","March 7, 2016",Beautiful National Park,35,"Chelmsford, Massachusetts",5

I must say the lady, we forgot her name, was so informative we had a better insight of the park. This made the drive easy for us. Take your time and stop at all the turnout and take in the views. Stop at the museum inside the park. I suggest having a national park pass. This will save you a lot of money there and all over our beautiful country.

Painted Desert,"So glad I decided to do a day trip here from Phoenix! I am an amateur photographer so I'm always trying to find something interesting to shoot. The Petrified Forest is one of those places that you can't comprehend until you see it in person. It's mind boggling to wrap your brain around the fact that 200+ million years ago this was a swampy, forested land where the trees eventually fell...and landed in a river bed where over million of years they crystallized into all of the petrified wood you see today. The colors of the petrified wood will blow your mind...I highly recommend making sure you see the better highlights such as the Giant Logs, Jasper Forest, and the Blue Mesa. And don't just go to the viewpoints and read the signs! Get out and do the short hikes! You won't be disappointed. After a full day of enjoying the Petrified Forest, we drove over to the Painted Desert and stopped at a few of the viewpoints. It was a great way to wrap up our day before we headed back. My only complaint was the park entrance at the south gate did not open until 7AM so we were unable to shoot the sunrise in the park. Other than that, it was a fantastic way to spend the day!

Painted Desert,"but ended up being fascinated by this park! To some it might be a bunch of rocks in a desolate landscape; to others it is an amazing place with everything from desert wilderness to easily accessed viewpoints and walks to view petrified logs and chunks of wood from the time of the dinosaurs in addition to ruins and petroglyphs left by more recent (but still ancient) human inhabitants of the area. It is difficult to comprehend the natural processes that occurred here to leave these remains of another time. A volunteer at the museum/visitor center in Holbrook recommended if we were short on time to start at the south/southwest entrance near Rainbow Forest Museum, then drive north, stopping at several overlooks, and choosing as many short trails as we had time for. We could then turn around and exit the way we came in, or drive on toward the Painted Desert entrance near the Interstate. That worked well for us, except we did choose to enter from the Painted Desert side. You could easily spend an entire day or more here, but allow a minimum of two to three hours.","March 4, 2016",Husband wasn't sure about visiting....,161,"WestSlope,CO",4

You get to stay in your car and drive the 28 mile park road and stop whenever you would like at various stops to see this amazing Painted desert. We stopped at Puerco Pueblo, Newspaper Rock, Agate Bridge and Giant Logs. The Newspaper Rock was crazy cool with petroglyphs from over 2000 years old. Giant Logs was a neat walk as well with logs laying all over the place. It's amazing to think that this was once a rainforest.","March 4, 2016",Amazing,338,"Green Bay, Wisconsin",5
Painted Desert,"Carload fee of $20 gets you into both petrified forest and painted desert (in the north) - good for 7 days (which was helpful to us). Also federal park passes are accepted. Note there is a separate entry in tripadvisor for the painted desert so this review will focus on the petrified forest portion of the national park (check out the painted desert in tripadvisor as well). Two entrances to the park - north and south. The south entrance goes to the Petrified forest areas and the north to the painted desert. The road goes all the way through so you can either go into the south entrance for petrified forest or the north and drive through the painted desert to get here - about 1 hour or so w/ no stops) . Nice visitor center (after you go through the entrance gate) w/ film and gifts/snacks gets you started from the south entrance. As you travel through, there are a few pullouts w/ short little hikes. If you take your time, you can get out of the car - (there are longer hikes that you can take into the backcountry). For geology buffs, this place is incredible - you can see (and get close up) to giant petrified logs. For some maybe they all look alike but for others, they just keep getting more spectacular. Can get some incredible photographs if you are interested. Makes you think what our world was like so long ago. Look at the national park website for times as the hours change with the months (both opening and closing). Although sometimes there are restrooms at the smaller exhibits, the main ones are located at the main buildings (visitor centers, inn etc.) so plan accordingly.It is desert weather so dress accordingly - can get quite chilly (and hot in the summer months). Weather was ideal in October when we went for hiking and checking it out.Depending on where you are planning on ending up, I think most people go through the park and come out of the opposite entrance. We liked it so much that we decided to get a place in Holbrook and visit the park over several days. This way we were able to not drive so much each day - and enjoy the park's beauty at different times of the day.I will leave descriptions for the various hikes so you can get out and check these out yourselves.","March 3, 2016",Go back in time,117,"Vista, California",5

Note there is a separate entry in tripadvisor for the petrified forest national park (so check that out as well). Although the painted desert is very large, most people visit only the portion within the petrified national park (in the northern section) - the rest is backcountry only and I believe navajo land in many areas. As I said the painted desert is in the north and so can be accessed by the north entrance (you can also enter the park by the south entrance - drive through the petrified forest to get here - about 1 hour or so w/ no stops) . Cool little visitor center w/ film and gifts/snacks gets you started from the north entrance. As you travel through, there are many pullouts w/ vistas and short little hikes. When we went it was not very crowded and most people seem to just snap a photo and then move on. We are a little slower choosing to hike around and get out of the car - (there are longer hikes that you can take into the backcountry). Even if those that cannot hike, the overlooks provide some beautiful views. For the photographer, timing of the day will be critical for all the colors (cannot say enough about the colors!). Look at the national park website for times as the hours change with the months (both opening and closing). A couple of miles into the park (from the north) is the Painted Desert Inn. This is currently a museum (used to be inn, diner & trading post). It was very interesting to us to see the pictures and exhibits (and the architecture of the inn). Recommend that you stop in here.

It is fun ( unless it is too hot) . The shortest walk they have is Martha's Butte: about 2km round trip. There is no trail, but it is not difficult to find.

Painted Desert,"On Day 2 our plan was to visit the Petrified Forest, which also is located within the Painted Desert. It was quite cool, 18 degrees so we took our time going out there. We started at the North entrance where we were able to watch the 18 minute movie on the history of the Petrified Forest. Afterwards we relaxed over a cup of coffee at the gift shop. Finally it was time to head out, there is a entrance fee for the park which is good for 7 days at that park. Here was our first lessoned learned, with our plans for the week we should have just purchased the annual interpark pass and been done with it; that was successfully resolved the next day.The park rangers let people know it was about a 45 minute drive without stopping and 4-5 hours if you took advantage of all the stops which we did. They were right, we spent a little over 4 hours. You might wonder why come here in the winter, it quickly got up to 40 degrees and I did not wear a jacket, the reason for coming in February... no crowds. Sure there were a few people but we were able to enjoy the park without the crowds. Starting at the North end we were treated to what we considered the highlights for the end. Don’t get me wrong, we enjoyed each stop, every corner was another treat to see. We walked the Blue Mesa trail, it was nice but we didn’t feel we saw what we expected when it came to petrified wood. It was the Crystal Forest and Long Logs trails that we experienced what we were looking for.

We also got some great shots of newspaper rock near sunset as the setting sun shone brightly on the petroglyphs. The painted desert was also stunning. We later visited the dobell ranch (mile 19 of hwy 180 and right 3 miles to Mesa)to see their free museum and harvest a bucket of their beautiful specimens. Really nice and knowledgable people.

The Park Rangers threaten you with the death sentence if you pick up the tiniest piece of wood and say your car will be searched as you exit. Don't risk it.

Painted Desert,"Out of the way and so worth it! Never seen anything like this, it was really spectacular, made me feel like I was on another planet. The painted desert and petrified national forest should be done together, can take about 2.5hours, part driving and part walking and whole extraordinary.

Painted Desert,"We stopped here on our long drive from Maryland to Las Vegas. It felt great to get out and stretch our legs for a few 1-mile walks and take in the scenery and geological history over a few hours. Funny that someone mentioned the person working in the Painted Desert Visitor Center...we had a laugh over her. Normally the people who work in the visitors centers go out of their way to be welcoming and helpful. When we asked for recommendations on short hikes, she said (with an attitude) ""Depends what you want to see"". When we asked about the Painted Desert walk that started 1/2 mile from the Visitors Center, she said ""I don't know, I've never been on it."" You can't make this stuff up (We took the walk anyway). So whoever is managing the visitor centers, you might want to think about employee training!","January 26, 2016","Beautiful, easy to see in a few hours",54,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

Painted Desert,We've heard good things about the Painted Desert so did research and made plans to visit. When we got there we found out the fee for cars to enter had recently almost doubled in price. While it still may be a reasonable value for a large family or van load of people it doesn't feel worth it for a car with 1 or 2 people in it. We decided to drive south through the free roads.

Make sure you give yourself a day to be able to go through the whole park starting at one visitor center and driving to the vistitor center on the other end. There are great hiking trails and lots to see along the way. There is so much petrified wood in so many colors and sizes it was amazing. I was not expecting the amount that was scattered everywhere. This park also has very beautiful multi colored badland formations, the remains of a native american village, part of old rte 66, petroglyphs and a museum at the Painted Desert Inn an old historic inn going back to the days of the Harvey girls. I highly recommend going through this park if you have the time.","January 20, 2016",So Beautiful,36,"Big Bend, Wisconsin",5
Painted Desert,"I was cruising down I-40 and saw signage advertising the park. I remembered stopping at the park on a family trip in the 1970's. I had a bout three hours, so decided to pull off the Interstate and see what was there.I entered on the I-40 entrance which is really about 25 miles north of the ""old"" entrance on the state highway 180 that goes to Holbrook. You can spend all day doing hiking in the painted desert areas and there are an ample number of trails and such. If you just want to see the giant petrified logs, then you need to enter off Highway 180. I went in December and there weren't too many tourists there that day. I didn't have to wait to see anything. I pulled off at several of the scenic overlooks to take photos.I can imagine this place can get super crowded in the summer with folks stopping by as they come and go from the Grand Canyon.If you have a few hours, I would stop at the historic buildings and overlooks on the park road. Really worth seeing.","January 19, 2016",A MUST STOP IF YOU HAVE THE TIME,31,"Greeley, Colorado",5

All the trails were walkable for all ages and abilities. It can be windy out there. The Blue Mesa offers an otherworldly special landscape, we enjoyed wildflowers on the Agate House trail and on the rim of the Painted Desert, and the Crystal Forest trail offered large petrified chunks to be appreciated up close in fascinating displays.","January 16, 2016",A Quietly Beautiful & Relaxing Park Experience,1,New Mexico,5
Painted Desert,"Note that this park closes its gates at 5:00p and there is no lodging/camping except Holbrook. Mostly badlands landscapes and of course petrified wood. I drove through the entire park and stopped at the overlooks and walked the paved trails at Giant Logs and Crystal Logs. There are several places to stop and view the Painted Desert although I thought Chinde Pt. was best since it is closest to the dune formations. Giant Logs is also impressive, but the best part was hiking to Jasper Forest. This is an ""off the beaten path"" designated hike without trail or markings. I suppose it's possible for someone to get lost, but you'd have to have zero sense of your surroundings. To the east is the park road, to the south the mostly visible overlook area, bluffs to the north, and a broad sandy wash to the west. This area blew the ""designated"" paths/exhibits away!! Some large logs, good density, blue mesa type cliffs, and areas where you're walking on small fragments of brilliantly colored wood. Of course no piece, large or small, should be removed from the park or even moved from its original spot. Go to Jim Gray's store in town; they've got some amazing (and pricey) pieces.","January 15, 2016",Off the beaten path hikes brings solitude,120,"Bowling Green, Kentucky",5

The trail near the visitor center is short and you can see the best petrified trees there. It doesn't take long. The drive to see the painted desert was just eh for us. Pretty but not much you do but snap a picture.

It's heartbreaking so much of the artifacts have been stolen over the years but still it is an amazing site to see these ancient trees and rocks. The park is well maintained as are all our National Parks. You can drive through and visit numerous side trails that are easy to navigate. I saw people with significant disabilites using wheel chairs, etc. who were able to see the sites. It's sunny, sunny, sunny so bring sun screen and water.","January 14, 2016",A must for school kids,10,Concord,5

The park is well laid out with lots of overlooks and several short hikes so that you can see the variety of the landscape. My favorite was the hike at the Blue Mesa. A steep start down but then flat at the bottom as you wander up close and can really see the blue, green, white layers. Definitely worth the time spent and reminded us of how old our planet really is.","January 9, 2016","Wow, just Wow!",10,"Dunwoody, Georgia",5

The desert is very appropriately named - the mix of colors actually make it look like someone had to have painted it! The main road through Petrified Forest National Park offers about 7 or 8 overlooks of the desert, and each one is equally beautiful and worth stopping for. Even if you are more interested in the petrified wood attractions at the southern end of the park, you should definitely make a stop here!

Now...So much to see and learn here. Trees that have turned to stone, some with geode-like crystal formations inside. The terrain with hills, canyons, and dried creeks. Just wow.Stop at the museum/visitor center first to learn a bit. It is free. Walk the area around it on the short trails to see some very cool petrified trees if you are able.Next, have your camera ready and drive through the park. If you cannot walk or hike you may drive through it and still have a great experience. If you can walk or hike, walk some of the trails to get up close to some amazing geological formations as well as some huge petrified trees. If you are anywhere near northeastern Arizona, this is worth a visit. Then, after the visit you can stop and purchase some petrified wood samples and/or geodes at any of the many vendors in the area.","January 3, 2016",Amazing experience.,9,"Los Angeles, California",5

The first part of the park was ok... The later part. Much more of the petrified wood and very cool. Take the opportunity to take a few of the walks, they are worth not only to stretch your legs, but awesome to see and touch ( no souvenirs from the trail!!!).

If you get off 40W exit you can not reenter the express way, so make sure you really want to do the drive. The information center is right there and you can do the first little loop drive and then go back over the express way and continue with the rest of the drive to the south exit. Right before you go back over the express way, make sure you stop by the Route 66 photo stop. The road actually went right through the park at that point years ago (my family traveled the whole Route 66 home) and I remembered that stop! There are great photo stops and small walks (all paved) that people with disabilities can handle. At the south end there is a nice shop and a very interesting museum. I loved the memories it brought back and was happy to share it with my husband.Just remember, if you enter the south entrance you have to drive the whole 26 mile loop drive and then drive it back again to exit.","January 1, 2016",Great photo shoot,65,"Melrose Park, United States",5

At that time there was many large logs along the drive. My husband and I decided to visit again in September. We were a bit disappointed compared to our first visit. There wasn't nearly as many large pieces remaining. I can't really understand as to why. It is highly illegal to remove anything from the park.

Driving the park road from either entrance works well.There's no real difference in which order you go. There's nothing to stop the sun, it's all flat and barren, so you won't get any shade. The northern section of the park (where you get in from I-40) is probably better off after noon because otherwise the valleys will be in deep shadow. But sometimes that's what you want to see.There are a bunch of overlooks, each one worth stopping for a few minutes.Newspaper rock is cool, but it takes some time to find it if the telescopes aren't already pointed in the right spot.Giant Logs and Crystal Forest are the best trails to take if you want to see and touch the petrified wood up close. But don't take any, you have to go out of the park if you want to buy some.This is a nice park to do in half a day or so, which is good because unless you live in the area, it will take half a day to get here from wherever you're coming from.","December 9, 2015",A Half a day's worth,120,NYC,4

There are a few trails that even I could limp on for a little time. I would love to return and really do some hiking. When I arrived at the south end they told me that a snow storm was predicted arriving around 11am. I decided to start driving and would see the movie at the end of my visit. Off I went with one jaw dropping vista after another. My favorite was Blue Mesa which due to the clouds looked like shades of purple. Indeed shortly after 11 it began to snow with no visibility. Since the park was empty I knew I would be able to drive to the north visitor center with no problem on the road. The movie last about 20 minutes and when I came out the sun was shining. I returned to the park and was able to see the areas I had missed. The 28 miles took me about 3 hours to drive and was a beautiful national park to see.

I definitely recommend taking this detour of about 1-1.5 hours. You can enter from the South on 180 (if you are heading East on I40) or the other way round. Make sure to stop at the visitor center.

Aside from being a historical showplace, it also houses the famous cougar petroglyph that the Petrified Forest uses in its marketing. It was found in the 1930s and now resides here.

Painted Desert,"On the first day of our road trip from Tucson, AZ to Ann Arbor, MI, we took two hours to visit the Petrified Forest and the Painted Desert which is part of the same park. Despite 40 mph sustained winds, we were not disappointed. You need a car to tour this desert because it’s at least 20 miles long from one gate to the other (you can exit to I-40 at either end), and there are a ton of things to enjoy along the way. Because we didn’t arrive until 3pm, the wonderful park ranger who admitted us explained that we had to be on our way out by 4:40p and made some great suggestions. Using the map she supplied (which described each stop) we decided to begin with the Petrified Forest (my husband’s main point of interest) and work our way back. There were few other visitors so we pretty much had the park to ourselves. Did I mention the wind? We walked the trail through the PF portion; it was worth it despite the fact that we had to walk literally bent over. “Newspaper Rock” fascinated me, and the telescopes on the cliff overlooking the rock make it easy to see the petroglyphs. The colors on the rock formations in the Painted Desert as the sun set were breathtaking. We’re both very happy we made time to visit this park and could have spent a third hour there.","November 11, 2015",An American Natural Wonder,73,"Saline, MI",4

Painted Desert,Excellent visit to this park. You're mainly driving through and stopping along the road to check out various sights and vistas. The fee is $20 for a car. I think it's good for 7 days in case you're staying in the area and want to return. I got there around 3PM and the park closes at 5PM. The entire road is about 28 miles long. With my limited time I had to bypass a few spots which I wish I had gotten do see. At 5PM they want you in your car and heading towards an exit. Not sure how strictly they enforce this. I did see a few Park Ranger trucks pass by. But I also saw some people stopping after 5PM and walking around. The main entrance off I40 has a gas station and visitor center as well as some food options. The other entrance/exit lets you off kind of in the back roads near two souvenir shops. Not much around until you hit old Route 66 in Holbrook. Visiting this park is definitely worth it. My suggestion is just get here as early as possible so you can take your time to soak it all in.

To think of those trees having been there for 200 million years. . . . I could have stayed there all day.

I could appreciate how crowded it must get in the summer with the road full of visitors and everyone attempting to park at the same look-out place, but for us, we felt we had the park to ourselves.

Wear a hat and sunglasses, it adds to your ability to view the sites without the sun interfering, Comfy shoes a must. There is a lot of sand, so sandals are a bad choice. There are restrooms spaced throughout the park so no worries. There is a 25 mile trip from the north to south ends of the park so gas up before you start your trip. The Harvey House gift shops in the park turn out to have better prices and nicer stuff than the icky stores outside the south entrance to the park...who would have guessed? Finally, and most important of all, don't just drive the park and not stop at the turn outs, you will be very disappointed if you don't go down the little side roads.

Allow at least 4 hours for this visit as there are numerous stops an photo opportunities. Some of the notable ones are Painted Desert Inn, Blue Mesa trail and the South entrance log area.

It is very picturesque. Make sure to stop at most of the look-outs (a few look-outs in the beginning are redundant).

Painted Desert,"As a child I saw photos of this National Park and dreamed of one day visiting it. It was one of the reasons that I began collecting rocks and minerals as a kid. While collecting specimen samples is no longer permitted - getting the opportunity to actually visit the site is enough for me.The Park actually includes four treats - a panoramic view of the painted desert in the Northern section - and the petrified tress in the Southern - and in the middle is a site with petroglyphs and a preserved sectionb of historic Route 66 (where you can ""get your kicks""). All are worth seeing! For me the sight of the amazing display of agates which have displaced the wood in the logs - preserving the fine details including the rings and know holes - is awe inspiring. Even today, after years of study, the exact process by which such granularity of preservation was possible remains a mystery waiting to be solved. I have included a few pictures I took but they don't do justice to the rich colors that you can experience in person. Before we arrived my son keep asking me what was worth seeing and I kept saying - the petrified logs. It was kind of like explaining rock-and-roll to an alien being. But once he saw them himself he understood. If you want to really appreciate the park you really need to get out and walk - so bring comfortable shoes and plenty of water. But even those who are less ambulatory can still witness the majesty of these trees enough to justify the trip!For those with a desire for solitude, reflection and roughing it. The painted desert area overs literally thousands of acres of wasteland in which to find (or lose) yourself.The petroglyphs must be viewed from afar. But there is a mounted set of powerful binoculars that allow a great ""up close"" view. Unfortunately I had only my cell phone camera (with no zoom lens) so no pics are available for posting. While there are still many unknowns related to these works of art - scientists have determined that one purpose was to track the seasons.My only regret is that we had only a few hours to spend at the site -","October 13, 2015",A Childhood Dream Come True,42,"Vienna, Virginia",5

Painted Desert,"Had been wanting to see this NP for years but hadn't due to it's location. We have never had a reason to drive that section of I-40. Finally pulled the trigger and booked a room in Holbrook, AZ and hit the road. The Painted Desert park entrance is little over 20 miles east of Holbrook on I-40 and easy to find. There is a fee but you get to visit the Painted Desert section along with the Petrified Forest. Be ready to take few hours to drive the park and bring plenty of water. The drive from one entrance to another is over 30 miles. We drove the entire park and exited at the Rainbow Forest Museum on the south end. You can also enter the park there from highway 180. As a caution there is literally no shade and the sun will beat you down on a hot day. There are many view points along the route and several short hiking opportunities. Most of the petrified trees are at the south end of the drive but there is plenty of incredible vistas in this desolate area. Was it worth an out of the way the trip? For us it was just to scratch it off our bucket list. Will we go back? Highly unlikely. I don't recommend this for anyone in a hurry.

After that, go south in the park both for the petrified wood and unusual formations. I particularly liked the Blue Mesa hike and the beautiful colors in that valley.

Painted Desert,"Within the park there are 12 separate attractions, all with their own special attributes. It is necessary to drive between them. It isn't all about petrified trees; the Indian artifacts are every bit as interesting. Don't expect to see an actual forest; that has long since past (about 225 million years ago) when trees as high as a dinosaur’s eye (or higher) covered the land. And then came rain and the trees were felled, riding their way down the river, where they soaked up water and settled down into the primordial ooze of the river bottom. This would have happened during the Triassic period.What we have today is a fast-forward of the evolutionary process; minerals seeped into the wood, replacing tree’s cellulose with minerals that eventually turned into the beautiful petrified creations of today.This particular National Park has the distinction of being the locale for the greatest concentration of petrified wood on earth.Best to begin the trip with a visit to the Rainbow Forest Museum and Visitor's Center.","September 25, 2015",28 miles of National Park,1377,Tucson,5

When I imagine a forest, I imagine a lot and a lot of trees. I agree that the number of trees' fossils are impressive (even if we can only approach a few of them), but the quantity of trees (that were carted by the current) are more like a wood. I was still impressed by the quality of some fossils conservation, you can see the xylem and phloem, and ring growth in some of them while in other are like kaleidoscope crystal colors.

You can stop and really give each area your full attention without having to worry about rushing off to the next. We've driven by this park several times on cross country trips and never stopped thinking it would take too much time. I'm sorry we didn't stop.

It put us way behind schedule (but, we had crossed over into a new time zone so that was okay. It was not insanely busy like many parks that we visited were this summer.

The petrified forest is also something to behold, trees millions of years old literally turned to rock like state by natural occurrences over time. There's a museum also which documents the history of the area and park and they also offer guided tours.

We drove into the park from the south entrance and made several stops along the way. We stopped first at the Rainbow Forest Museum and also did the Giant Logs trial just outside. It was very hot so if you go in the summer bring water. The Giant Logs trail is very easy and has several large petrified logs. We next stopped at the Crystal Forest Trail, lots of petrified logs about. Next we stopped and hiked the Blue Mesa trail which I highly recommend and finally stopped at Puerco Pueblo which is also a great spot to see some Petroglyphs.

Painted Desert,"Ever gotten sunburned in a forest? Well, in this forest it's possible. All the ""trees"" are on the ground and have been transformed into stone (quartz to be exact). These former trees (their trunks, that is) are scattered around the south side of the park. There is a small visitor's center that you can visit. It covers some of the history of the forest tree-wise and animal-wise (from the dinosaur age). It is not large, so you probably won't be spending a lot of time there. There are places you can hike to, so you can see interesting things. Many places allow you to drive close to them with only a very short hike. As you move north through the park, the scenery becomes more about the interesting geology of the land with erosion making for some ""out of the ordinary"" scenery. Some of the places to visit are where former inhabitants from long ago once lived ... and made art (petroglyphs) among other things. Your park fees will take you into the Painted Desert, too. This is another part of the park all about the beauty of the geology of the area. It has quite a few scenic stops. I do wonder if it might be better enjoyed in the early morning and early evening. That might cause the colors to enhance even more. That's just a guess, though. There is a large gift shop/restaurant at the north entrance. It's was our eating destination, since there wasn't much else around in the way of a place to eat. It wasn't the best ... it wasn't the worst, but it did fill our stomachs.My best tip ... wear sunscreen.

Stop at the visitors center on the way in, pick up an excellent map, & then take your time driving through the park. It is worth stopping at each of the overlooks - the views are different from each. My recommendation is to enter the park from the north (exit 311) on I40 and drive north to south - it's easier to get into most of the pull-offs.

That being said, if you do not mind walking a bit there are trails you can go on to get different views. Most of the trails are short, but you need to be in fair shape for several because they drop you down in elevation and you have to be able to climb back out...not suggested in very warm weather. Having been there many years before and forgot how cool it is. We also forgot about the trails and side trips which meant we had to skip a few because of our time schedule. Next time we plan to stay close by so we can spend a whole day there and take a few hikes we had to skip. There is a North entrance off Interstate 40 and a South entrance off Highway 180. We did the North entrance both times we visited and intend to use the South entrance next time. We suggest you try the South entrance and if you are traveling West to East and the North entrance if traveling East to West. Whatever you do, if you like to do more than just stop at view points and are willing to explore some, go early and plan on the better part of a day.

Painted Desert,"We went to see this in the fall and the weather was great. To call it a forest for those that are not familiar with it is not quite accurate. It is a lot of petrified wood lying down, but it is such a great experience to see them and to see the ancient things of the earth is worth the time and money. It is run by the Federal Govt. National Parks system. If you have a park pass, bring it and get in free or with a discount. The price also includes the Painted Desert which is just north of the PF. It is a very good experience for children 5 to teens. The younger ones with just love running around. There are some teaching areas, so don't just pass by, they are worthwhile. Cell phone pictures are ok, but trust me, bring a camera, and a big memory card. Painted Desert is not to be photographed with a cell phone.

The total drive is 28 miles so you'll want to allow at least 2-3 hours since you'll be stopping. The sand dunes get more beautiful as you drive north as the colors become more vibrant.

There's several different pull offs, and picturing taking areas. Each has a board with information on it. It's a great drive -- pretty sights with some historical information.

As we pulled away I scoffed a little at the thought that it would take that long. Fooled me! We actually left the other end through the gate about 15 minutes after the official closing time. A ranger actually was starting his drive through to (we guessed) make sure everyone else had cleared out. There were so many incredible pull offs to view the desert and parts of the Petrified Forest and to take pictures that it took WAY longer than I thought it would.

Painted Desert,"This National Park, not far from Holbrook in Arizona, is well worth a visit. Just off the Interstate 40, it also straddles the ""Mother Road"", Route 66, now virtually defunct of course although parts remain. We entered at the Painted Desert end of the Park. We watched an 18 minute film presentation in the Visitor Centre and then had a look around the Centre itself where a Ranger, Kenneth, was a mine of information about the Park and the surrounding area. There are a number of places from where you can view the Painted Desert landscape which is breathtaking. We visited the Lodge and were given birthday cake and soft drinks to celebrate the 99th birthday of the Parks service. For the same reason we didn't have to pay an entrance fee which is normally $10 per car which in itself would have been a bargain in our view. Unfortunately, we had just reached point 5 from where it is possible to view petroglyphs when a storm hit the area and we had to take shelter in our car for the best part of an hour while lightning flashed and rain lashed down. It was still raining when we completed the drive and whilst we were able to view the petrified wood from our car, due to the rain we were unable to see the other petroglyph site. We had just reached the Petrified Forest end of the Park when the heavens opened again and, once more, we took shelter in that Visitor Centre. Whilst we were sheltering, we viewed the various exhibits and they were extremely interesting. During this time, one of the Rangers received a 'phone call from his wife to say that their dirt road had washed away but he didn't seem too worried. We were heading for Winslow and we asked him if we would be able to get there given the weather. We took his advice and carried on to find that Winslow and the surrounding area was completely dry whereas the roads around the National Park some 45 minutes away were awash!","August 27, 2015",Fantastic!,176,"Marden, United Kingdom",5

Its about a 26 mile drive all the way down from the visitors center, and then depending on which way you are heading (we were going to Gallup) you may need to turn and head all the way back, so make sure to allow yourself enough time for the driving as well as the stopping/sightseeing. Lots of different views and changes to see staring with the Painted Desert and then winding down to the Petrified Forest. Beautiful drive and lots of pull-outs for stopping and taking pictures.

Painted Desert,"Growing up, my family traveled to Arkansas from Los Angeles to visit my grandparents, frequently. We generally left LA early Saturday morning and arrived in Arkansas Sunday night with an overnight stop in Albuquerque, NM. Dad was always on a time schedule, so stopping to visit one of the sights advertised by roadside signs was out of the question, no matter how much we begged. The only exception to this that I can remember was ""The Painted Desert,"" since we could see this sight from the side of Hwy. 40 during a 5 or 10 minute rest break. Visiting the Petrified Forest nearby was ""too far"" off the highway and would ""take too long.""Once I became an adult, I have visited all these sights that we missed growing up, and this was perhaps my third or fourth time stopping to observe the colors and formations of The Painted Desert. It was my teenage grandsons,' aged 16, 15 and 14, first time. I did not remember that The Painted Desert was part of The Petrified Forest National Park, but it is. And so, if you visit one you should take the time to visit the other. There is a 28 mile road that cuts through the Park going south from Hwy. 40. On this visit, it was pretty cloudy with sporadic rain. The colors were deeper reds and blues than I remember when visiting on extremely sunny days.The Painted Desert and its colors alone are worth the 28 mile scenic drive through the Park.","August 24, 2015","The Painted Desert, Stunning Views and Colors on Cloudy or Sunny Days!!!!",176,"Los Angeles, California",5

Painted Desert,"This was my third time visiting the Petrified Forest and I have been impressed on each visit. This visit was part of a cross-country road trip with my wife and grandsons and we stopped on our return from a family reunion in New Orleans. The road thru Petrified Forest National Park is 28 miles long beginning near Hwy. 40, but the most spectacular sights of petrified wood occur near the end of the road thru The Park.Growing up in Los Angeles, we passed the signs leading to The Petrified Forest on numerous occasions when my parents took us to visit our grandparents in Arkansas. No matter how much we begged, our father would not stop at this attraction (or any other attraction). It was always a trip to Arkansas and return with an overnight stop about halfway in Albuquerque, NM.My first visit was when a brother and I returned to Los Angeles from a summer in Arkansas with our uncle during the 1950s. We were successful in getting him to stop, but only briefly at the edge of the park where we saw a few samples of petrified wood and were able to buy some souvenirs. My second visit was in 1983 also on a return trip to Los Angeles from New Orleans with my wife and our 13 year old daughter. This was part of The Road Trip to end all Road Trips (LA to Seattle, to Banff Canada, to Yellowstone, to Mt. Rushmore, to Arkansas, to New Orleans, to Houston, to San Antonio, to LA) when we travelled 8200 miles and attended two family reunions (one in Seattle and one in Little Rock, Arkansas), and experienced a major Hurricane in Houston, Texas. Having experienced all this in one road trip, I still was quite impressed with the number of petrified logs, whether whole or broken, along the Hwy. through The Petrified Forest. I mention this because my sister was quite disappointed when she did NOT see standing petrified trees in ""The Petrified Forest.""On this trip, I had my teenage grandsons in tow, not my daughter who is now in her 40s. I must say that I was just as impressed with The Petrified Forest on this trip as I was when I toured The Petrified Forest National Park with my daughter 32 years ago!!!!","August 21, 2015",Third Time's A Charm at the Petrified Forest!!!!,176,"Los Angeles, California",5

We entered the park at the North/Interstate entrance which worked perfect so we could drive through the park and head strait South from there, avoiding having to go back through. When you enter from this direction you are actually at the bottom of the painted desert. There are some very pretty sites. There is a visitors center at both entrances, and like other National Parks make sure your kids get a Junior Ranger book and fill it out on the way. They get a great badge at the end. Memories that last forever. The best Petrified forest sits are on the South end of the park. Be sure you get out and see them. Its hot, but the trails are well defined. The office also has a good film about how the park was formed.

Stopped at Newspaper Rock where we could look down from the overlook to see the petroglyphs, some as old as 2000 years. 'The Tepees' were dozens of stratified rock formations. At Agate Bridge we saw a large petrified log spanning a gully. The Flattops were well named, as if someone had come along and lopped the tops off the hills. Lots of petrified wood lying around and some fine examples round the Rainbow Forest museum. Our last stop round this awesome park was into the museum, with lots of dinosaur bones and geology information on the area. Overall we would mark the park ten out of ten, wonderful!","August 18, 2015",Wonderful!,102,"Kilwinning, United Kingdom",5

The park ranger was very helpful in showing us which overlooks we should stop at in the amount of time that we had to spend in the park. The trails are nice and fairly easy to walk. Hiked Giant Logs and Crystal Forest and stopped at numerous overlooks, all of which were very scenic and worth stopping for.Cons: Bathrooms are few and very far between.Tips: Start at the south end and head north through the park. Bring your hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, camera, and some good shoes for walking.","August 18, 2015",A Forest of Stone,180,USA,5

From the north part where vermilion, mauve and yellow dominate to the South part where yellows, blacks, greens and tans dominate, it is worthwhile...

We walked the trail around the petrified logs. Most are sections of old trees but there are a few ""logs"" lying around. Even the logs look like they were cut by a woodsman, but it's just natural. There is one log called ""Old Faithful"" that is huge, you can see part of its root ball. There are several spots to stop and take pictures or walk/hike around. After walking around the Rainbow Forest Museum area we drove on to Jasper Forest, Blue Mesa, Newspaper Rock, Puerco Pueblo, Route 66, and Painted Desert Inn. One of the best places is Blue Mesa - the dirt is a bluish purple and is just amazing. Newspaper Rock has a lot of petroglyphs as does the Puerco Pueblo area. Route 66 originally passed through here but the only thing left is old telegraph poles. The area around the Painted Desert Inn is like a mini Grand Canyon.

We entered the park at Holbrook and stopped at the Rainbow Forest Museum. This is a small museum that houses a few exhibits of fossils and petrified wood. There is a path behind here that has numerous samples of petrified wood. Rangers were on hand to provideinformation and answer questions. From here we continued our drive through the park. Favorite area was the Blue Mesa loop. We had several locals tell us the PFNP was really worth the time but I strongly disagree. It was one of our favorite things we did in Arizona.

The light was completely different from one minute to the next. If I were a photographer, I think I could spend years here playing with the light on the desert. The visitor's center is great, too, with a little film about the history and geology of the park. I'm told that the Jr. Ranger program here was the first in the nation, and that the Jr Ranger badges they give out are the only ones in the country that are the same size as the regular Park Ranger badges.","August 3, 2015",Beautiful in the Rain!,31,"Tyler, Texas",5

Painted Desert,What a great national park! The Painted desert views were awesome and certainly picture worthy! The park visitors were just enough on our visit so as not to make the experience too crowded! The park is divided by the Interstate Highway with the beautiful Desert on the north side and the equally beautiful Petrified Forest on the south side but the park road passes over the Interstate plus there is a Route 66 Monument where old road was inside the park near the Interstate! The petrified wood is abundant and beautiful and you can find souvenir wood at many local shops out side the park to take home without scavenging the park! The Painted Desert Inn (restored to 1930's glory)is worth a short visit while in the park! You can enter and exit at both ends of the park for reasonable access to the Interstate and local towns. You will be able to see the Painted Desert again from east side of South Rim of Grand Canyon! Highly recommended stop!

Painted Desert,"The painted desert is part of the Petrified Forest National Park, located at exit 311 off of I-40 NE of Holbrook, Arizona. The Painted Desert Visitor Center will be the first building on your right. This is also the Park Headquarters. The Park covers over 145 square miles north and south of I-40. Generally speaking, most of the painted desert vistas are north of I-40, while most of the Petrified Forest logs are located south of I-40. $10 per car. In season, generally open between 7 am and 7 pm. Colours includes deep Reds, yellows, pinks, greys, blues, whites and tans. There are many stops along the 28 mile road through both the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest. Photo points north of I-40 include Tiponi point, Tawa point, Kachina point (and the Painted Desert Inn, an old lodge now an art gallery/museum), Chinde point, Pintado point, Nizhoni point, Whipple point, Lacey point and the Route 66 marker. Regarding this last, the Route 66 marker is not the site of the actual original road. The actual,road went along a series of telephone poles several yards to the south of the marker. Crossings over the Interstate to the south, observation points include Puerco Pueblo, where you can see some ruins and also some Indian petroglyphs. Then newspaper Rock, a much more well known petroglyphs area, blue Mesa spur, Agate Bridge, Jasper forest, Crystal forest and the Rainbow Forest Museum, specialising inpetrified wood - where the first Visitor Center did not.. Pieces of petrified wood can be extremely colourful or fairly boring, depending on the combination of minerals crystallised within the piece. Picking up either coloured soil or petrified wood from the par is illegal, and upon exiting the Park, you and your car may be checked by Park Rangers! Buy only from the Park gift shop or from authorised rock shops. When you exit the south side of the Park, turn right onto U.S. Highway 180 and drive into Holbrook (after a couple of miles there will be a 'T' intersection, turn right to stay on 180). Stay on the road through the old section of Holbrook (many rock shops) passing under I-40. Be in the right lane and rejoin I-40 west at junction 286.

Painted Desert,I really had no idea what to expect from the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert. We were on a driving tour and it was along the way - so we had planned to stop. So what do you do there ? It is a driving tour of a park that is about 28 miles in all with many things to see along the way. This National Park is the perfect Route 66 stop as it is made to be seen as a drive. Along the way there are stoping points with beautiful scene and interesting sights -- opportunities to stay longer with brief additional walking tours if you are so inclined. I would allow at least 2 hours to see the whole thing and then you would be rushing it a bit. My Teenage son liked our visit more so than Carlsbad Caverns so that is saying something.

But, if you have a camera along and you want to explore the trails (most very easy and relatively short) plan on at least four hours to spend more time taking pictures of the rock formations and the wonderful color gradations. The petrified tree logs are very interesting but in my opinion are not the highlight of the park. Also, as you exit the park there are several places where you can buy pieces of the wood. I think your experience of wonderful colors will depend on weather conditions and time of day that you drive through.

This park is easily enjoyed in 2-3 hours on a car tour, with stops and short walks. You don't have to do a great deal of hiking (though, if you have the time and the stamina, there is plenty of that, too.) Some other highlights are the Blue Mesa, and the Crystal Forest loop trail.

It is amazing what sediments can do, it is like your are gong back in time, millions of years. Those trees may have observed Dino's walking by.

The only downside were the winds -- with heavy winds in the area that day it was kind of hard to walk/hike along. Our car windshield also got chipped during to small pieces of rock. I would recommend to grab some togo lunch/snacks before hand to save time and make best use of the day. The visitor center had good information and is worth a stop before exploring the area.

We went on a cross country road trip and want to explore want different parts of the country looked like. When we looked in our tour book, we thought a painted desert would be interesting to see. Sure enough when we visited the Petrified Forest National Park, we discovered the beauty of this region of the country. We have never seen anything so up close and beautiful. As we moved down the driving path, the more beauty we discovered in the desert-scape, dubbed the ""painted desert"". I would say by standing out on the hills looking out into the distance, it felt like standing in heaven looking at the creations of mother nature. Much of the scenery looked like pictures right out of postcards. Just describing the scenery does not give it justice. You have to be there to soak in the entire experience; the warm wind blowing in your face, the peace of hearing nothing, and the tranquility of being in touch of nature. When you are going to Arizona, do make a point to visit the Petrified Forest National Park, and experience the sensation of the ""painted desert"".

Painted Desert,"Petrified Forest NP was the ninth and final National Park we visited on our vacation through the southwest. Maybe my impressions would have been different if it was the first park we visited. In all fairness, each National Park is unique and really can't be compared to each other. While some of the ""as far as the eye can see"" vistas were incredible, in my humble opinion many of the overlooks lacked a certain sense of awe that made you want to stay as long as possible. We were actually quite content just driving along the 28-mile park road and soaking it all in from the car. However, we did stop at a few overlooks including Tiponi Point, Chinde Point, Route 66, Newspaper Rock, The Tepees, Agate Bridge, Jasper Forest, and Crystal Forest. These made for great photo ops, but we concluded that (for the casual tourist) most of the overlooks and stops all looked the same. In a trip that included the Grand Canyon, Arches, Canyon de Chelly, Mesa Verde, and others, Petrified Forest was the ""black sheep"" for our family. If you're a geologist (amateur or otherwise), this is your place. If you find stark, wide-open, desert vistas inspirational, this is your place. I am a huge advocate for the National Park System, so I do recommend seeing Petrified Forest at least once. Despite my mediocre review, I do understand why the park is here and can appreciate its significance. However, while I dream of one day returning to places such as Arches, Canyonland, and the Grand Canyon, I am content with my one visit to Petrified Forest and will likely not return.","July 16, 2015",Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!,490,"Malvern, Pennsylvania",3

We expected to just drive through it, get the passports stamped, and be on our way. Well, we were definitely surprised not only by the beauty of the painted desert, but by the sheer number of petrified wood pieces scattered throughout the property. If you could walk in some areas of the park, you would be tripping over the petrified wood. And the wood here is so beautifully colored. I think our biggest surprise was the number of Native American ruins and petroglyphs that were there. They are definitely worth seeing. We stayed longer than we anticipated and didn't want to leave because we wanted to do two more hikes. But a thunderstorm was imminent so we had to leave.

Painted Desert,We drove through Painted Desert on our way back from Petrified Forest. The views from the cliffs were breathtaking. The colors off the cliffs were all asters.

I recommend doing it once.,"July 10, 2015",Lots of overlooks...Go at sunset,50,"Yorba Linda, California",3

You can do the whole thing in 5 or 6 hours at a decent pace with walking a few of the trails. We skipped the longer trails at the south end due to temps and time, it was great to walk down into the forest and see the history up close. The visitor center was exceptional, lots of exhibits and information. Great trip and must see if you are in the area.","July 9, 2015",Fantastic history and great sights,70,"Neenah, Wisconsin",5

The story behind the fossilized trees is amazing, but there's trails, panoramic views for those that don't want to walk a long ways, and great petroglyphs. It's well worth the price of admission.

I thought the Blue Mesa area was prettier and looked more painted. Still, it is a nice drive from the Painted Desert visitor center to the Rainbow Forest center, but plan to spend more time in the Rainbow Forest area. Painted Desert is just a quick drive through.","July 8, 2015",Not what I expected,46,"Detroit, Michigan",4
Painted Desert,"Great place to visit! It is different from your typical national park- if you're looking for great hiking trails and majestic vistas, you won't find it here. There are only 7 trails and they are all fairly short. What you will find is the desert in all its splendor. The Painted Desert area was nice to look at, but not my favorite. The historical aspect of this park is neat- it used to be a major stopping point along the old Route 66- you can even stop at the historic Painted Desert Inn and see and old car where the route used to cut through the park. You can see lots of petroglyphs and remnants of old pueblos. It is in the desert, so keep that in mind when you plan. We arrived in the afternoon and it was HOT! The temp reading in our car said 106. Because of this, we didn't do a lot of hiking but still enjoyed our visit. The petrified wood is so amazing to see- beautiful colors and textures. I enjoyed the Blue Mesa area and thought it looked more ""painted"" than the painted desert area. There is a one-mile hike through the Blue Mesa area that is really beautiful. The Crystal Forest area was my favorite- tons of pieces of petrified wood, many really close to the trail so you can get up close, and beautiful colors. Be sure to stop at the gift shop and pick up your own pieces of petrified wood, as you absolutely cannot take from the park itself!","July 8, 2015",Fascinating,46,"Detroit, Michigan",4
Painted Desert,"This park is the easiest National Park we have navigated! We were able to drive then stop and look at marked viewing areas. The free map given at the welcome center was very accurate and helpful! The scenery was beautiful!! We hiked the one mile Blue Mesa trail- it was amazing!

Painted Desert,"with so many more spectacular sites within a day's drive, this has some fairly nice vistas and a couple of well preserved petroglyphs to view - if you've got nothing better to do (other than stand on a corner in Winslow Arizona), it's a worthwhile side trip - but as a destination... not so much.","July 7, 2015",a lesser attraction,64,"Gardnerville, Nevada",3

Blue Mesas were something to see.","July 6, 2015",Great unexpected stop,17,"Magazine, Arkansas",5
Painted Desert,This is an amazing place. Enter from the Southern gate and work your way North for the grandest view. We stopped and viewed at each area and each one is even more incredible. By the time you get to the Northern most areas you probably have had enough walking and viewing and will do a drive by when all of the sudden the whole sky and view opens up even more to see a fantastic display.

Painted Desert,"Allow a bout a half a day to really take in the all that there is to see. You can certainly race through, but I recommend you take your time to fully take in the view. The visitor center/gift shop is a great stop. There items are very reasonably priced and have a wide variety of items. There is another gift shop on the other end at the beginning of the Petrified forest, but not as expansive, more rocks and jewelry. It was definitely hot in July, but it was bearable while going in and out of the air conditioned car. Take the full loop and go into the Petrified Forest. There are lots of great views all throughout the loop, we did stop at most of them and each one offered a little something different. We had a 9, 10 and 12-year-old and they all loved it! We even saw a Pronghorn antelope! Take plenty of water and some snacks to keep the ""whining"" to a minimum. The whole loop took us about 3 hours with our stops, could have stayed longer.","July 6, 2015",Half a day excursion,6,,4
Painted Desert,"This is basically the north end of the Petrified Forest National Park. Lots of multicolored striations, especially highlighted when you run into some hills known as The Tepees. Right off of I-40 at exit 311. Worth a look if you're in the area. Set aside about 4 hours to get a decent look at the whole park. The park didn't seem to have an overwhelming number of visitors, so you can get some peace and quiet here.","July 5, 2015",Something to see!,258,"Williamston, Michigan",5
Painted Desert,"I've always wanted to come here since I read about it as a kid, and since I was visiting the Grand Canyon, I decided to incorporate this into the trip. It would probably be a 3 and a half hour drive from the Desert View east entrance of the GCNP if you didn't stop. There are other sights along the way like Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monument, but we didn't have time to stop for them. We passed through Holbrook and entered the south entrance of the park from 180. At first, I thought I was making a wrong turn, as there were some gaudy looking shops right there, but just drive past them and the park entrance will be further up the road. Entrance fee is $10 a car. Nice visitor center with a film and exhibits explaining the formation of the petrified wood. There's a huge log a short walk behind the visitor center. Afterwards, we did the drive through the park. Unfortunately, there was intermittent rain during our visit, so we didn't get to walk around as much as planned. We did stop at an area known as The Tepees, which were large hills with multicolored bands. Really unusual. Also stopped at Newspaper Rock, which is a rock covered with petroglyphs. You view it from a platform through telescopes because they don't want to risk visitors coming up close to it and possibly destroying it. Also stopped at Puerco Pueblo, which is a ruin complex, also with petroglyphs, including one which marks the summer solstice. There's the Painted Desert Inn, which is a national historic landmark, but it was closed by the time we reached it. Exited out the north entrance to get to I-40. There's a visitor center right outside the gate and also a gift shop where you can buy examples of petrified wood. Spent about two and a half hours in the park but if it wasn't raining and we weren't so late we could have spent another two hours there. Glad I went.","July 5, 2015",Unique sights!,258,"Williamston, Michigan",5

We stopped at to overlooks and pull outs to take photos of it all. Inspirational, but we had only scratched the surface. I noticed as we stopped at the visitor center that a rangers take was voting to happen at 2pm at the famous Painted Desert Inn. The inn is now a museum and the history of its nearly 106 years was interesting. Our ranger, Roy Pilgrim was excellent. We. Continued our drive and was awed at each stop. If you have the time, make the entire 28-30 mile drive. Expect to take about 4 hours if you include the ranger talk. At 5pm we made our way back to our chosen lookout point, pulled our our travel chairs, small cooler of cold drinks, our picnic basket and waited for sunset. Every 30 min I took a photo of the same spot. Each highlighted a different color of the desert.

This is a National Park with an entrance fee unless you are a Senior and have the ""America the Beautiful"" entrance card. There are so many petrified logs strewn thoughout the partk and the many colored vistas of the Painted Desert are simply spectacular. With each passing hour the sun changes and the Painted Desert comes alive with varied colors. One can actually drive in one entrance (I did off of Hwy 191 & 13) and drive out the other entrance onto to I-40 (about 26-28 miles in total). There are view points throughout the park and also hiking trails. The Visitor Center is very good and informative and one can learn a great deal of the ""how"" this petrified wood occurred; the film is just the right length to watch and learn. There is also a snack, water & tourist memoralbilia available at a close by location to the Visitor Center. I have been a fan of Route 66 for many years and I was able to get my 'fix' in with a stop where Route 66 is memorialized with an old Studebaker and a bumper with signage on a cement posting that is great for photo ops.

Painted Desert,We were nearby and had an extra day in our agenda so we decided to go. It was very pretty with unusual land formations and colors. There were many petrified rocks to look at and walking paths for viewing. at one end of the Petrified Forest resides the Painted Desert with more colorful landscapes to view. Go in May.

Painted Desert,Petrified Forest NP was pretty interesting.

Painted Desert,It's astounding to me that the long buried petrified wood has weathered out of its matrix rock and is seen just laying on the surface. This is beautiful rock in rainbow hues and there are great quantities of these logs just everywhere. And since it was springtime the temperatures were not too high and there were some beautiful wildflowers blooming in profusion. There is a welcome center at each end of the park. This is my second time visiting and it won't be my last. ,"June 26, 2015",Amazing petrified wood,45,"Pinckney, Michigan, United States",5

Painted Desert,"We visited the Petrified National Park as the third stop in our day. In retrospect, we did not allow enough time to fully explore the park, so plan accordingly. Traveling east on US 40 from Flagstaff, our first stop was Walnut Canyone, then to Winslow to stand on the corner, and then the Petrified Forest. We entered the park off of 180 (south entrance) and explored the trails next to the visitor center. It was a very hot day and you are out in the open with no shade...... so be prepared. With more time, would have liked to drive the main road through the park (25 miles end to end) and explore some of the other trails. The Blue Mesa trail has been named as very surreal and almost like walking on the moon or another planet. At the northern end is the Painted Desert, but it was a long drive back to Flagstaff so we weren't able to see the other trails. Glad that we stopped for a short visit to see this wonder of nature.","June 21, 2015",A step back in time...250 milliion years back,32,Cincinnati,4

Painted Desert,"I've driven on I-40 by the Petrified Forest dozens of times and finally decided to stop with my grandkids. The staff was wonderful. Very pleasant and helpful. They suggested that my grandkids become Jr. Rangers which was very exciting to them. The Jr. Ranger booklet was somewhat difficult and a little confusing for them. Fortunately they really didn't care what the kids wrote and passed them all off, which was very exciting for them. It was mid June and the temperatures were awful and we really didn't want to get out of our car. We walked the .75 mile trail and that was all my grandkids (ages 5,10 &11) could handle. I would not suggest taking younger kids. It was pretty boring for them. Not a lot to see. There were a few amazingly beautiful sites but not nearly enough to really make the 28 mile drive worth it to me. I guess it was worth seeing once but I won't make a second trip there. Also, the heat was awful. So plan your vacation accordingly. Arizona is not pleasant in the summer!The entrance fee was $10 per car.","June 20, 2015",Ok but not great,24,"Temecula, California",3

Be sure to visit both Visitors Centers (Painted Desert and Rainbow Forest Museum), for some nice souvenirs that are reasonably priced (a nice surprise compared with other VC's we were in!). A short drive from the Rainbow Forest VC, is a Nat'l Historic Landmark Museum, a Pueblo Revival-style structure. Fascinating history. At the Painted Desert (confused yet?) is a very nice cafeteria next to the gift shop, run by the Xanterra commissary group, and they do a great job of preparing hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, tuna salad,etc. with a variety of drink offerings at a decent price.

There is a couple handicap parking spots and handicap accessible. Also stopped in the gift shop which is jusr a walk down from the visitor center. Very easy in and out access. There is a gift shop before even entering the park that I wish I would have stopped in to compare the prices of items I bought inside the park. There is a $10.00 entrance fee to the park but well worth it in my opinion. Going E on 40 you get off 40 and follow the signs.

I recommend doing that...otherwise you may stop at a few that are the same, get bored, and miss the unique stops. Purchased a $20 piece of a petrified tree at the exit, then passed about a dozen mom and pop shops outside the park selling the same stuff (likely cheaper).

There were some areas with steps, but even in those areas most of the views were readily accessible without the climb. Entering through the southernmost entrance let us begin by viewing the short movie at the small museum. It helps with the experience and is quite interesting.

I learned so much about the history of this land area from the fantastic rangers on the job. I never knew how all these pieces of trees got to be scattered all over the desert. The pieces of trees are in varied degrees of petrification and the one that have crystalized already are fantastic. We also really enjoyed the blue mesa area and took the loop down into the area which resembles a moonscape...very eerie.

The way this works is that you once you enter the park, you drive a 28 mile road that travels the length of the park. Along the way there are multiple stops and side roads that allow different views and historical tidbits. If you enter the park via I-40, you will start at the painted dessert. Then as you follow the road you will reach Indian ruins with petroglyphs and the further down you'll hit the petrified forest. You'll want to stop at every point because each is unique and offers varying experiences. There are also a lot of hiking opportunities (and backpack camping). We decided to stop here on our way to the Grand Canyon. I only regret not giving ourselves more time. We had 2.5 hours until the park closed so we had to rush through everything.

Be sure to watch the video at the entrance. We didn't and was filled with tons of questions by the end of the road. A park ranger said everything we asked was in the video! Do not go past the newspaper rock and not stop!!! that was amazing all the petroglyphs and huge rocks. Every trail is paved and a short walk. The bridge is also very very cool to see.

Painted Desert,"My family and I visited here on our family vacation this year, on our way from Colorado Springs to the Grand Canyon. I had been as a kid and didn't remember much, but I really wanted the kids to see this amazing act of nature. It is huge, and took us practically all day to see everything. There is nearly 20 pull off- observation points as well as several short hiking trails. I was amazed at everything! Sometimes I had to touch the the trees that wee close the trail to make sure they were indeed petrified: Some of them looked so much like fresh fallen trees. The kids enjoyed the Junior Ranger program and it was a very great way to spend the day.","May 24, 2015",Amazing! Way more than I expected!,23,"Parker, Colorado",5

Painted Desert,"To imagine these 'trees"" are as ancient as they are, and they maintain the texture but display amazing colours. The terrain is quite harsh so wear a hat and long selves especially in the hotter weather. Well worth a diversion and the $10.00 park entrance fee. BTW. If you are considering visiting several National Parks or monuments, get yourself a $80 'America the Beautiful' year park pass...they also credit otherNP visits if you can show the Passes...I.e we could produce Sequoia, Death Valley, and Grand Canyon passes, so only paid an additional $15.00'for one year of unlimited US park visits...

Painted Desert,"I really underestimated Petrified Forest until I got there ... it's not just about petrified wood: the Painted Desert is there and is something completely unique to anything I have seen before. Lots of colored layers of what I believe are largely sand hills eroded over time, stretching for hundreds of miles. At one point, you can see the San Francisco Peaks located in Flagstaff from Petrified Forest -- 120 miles away! Not a lot of walking required, the park is 20 miles by road at least ... basically a driving tour with many stops that you can either take or skip. We skipped one stop because the park was closing (made it to exit with 5 minutes to spare) and I regret it. The pamphlet with a black & white photo of PFNP that we got at another park unit did not do it justice. The layers of color are fantastic. PFNP was a backup location for the trip, and we only made it as the rain in Sedona and Flagstaff made us want to veer away from the storm. We ended up staying ahead of the storm... the pictures of the rain from miles away in the background of the landscapes looked cool. Very glad we went.","May 18, 2015",Fantastic,11,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

There are many places you can stop and take pictures or just enjoy the quiet. There are bathrooms at only a few sights, so pace your beverage intake. We started with the desert and then went south to the Petrified Forest. There is a visitor center at the beginning and at the end. Take advantage of these.

Don't be fooled by the two big tourist traps just before you get to the park entrance. They're not park authorized. There's a museum and gift shop just a short way inside the gates that should be your first of many stops. So many great views and historical interest areas along the way. Just watch the speed limits, which change fairly frequently. They will stop you. We got away with a warning, but not sure that was always the case.

This beautiful forest has fossils of Tall Conifer trees reptiles, small dinosaurs and giant amphibians. Petrified forests is evidence of early human occupation in this area.

The entry fee is $10 per car and the park itself is stunning. I prefer the Painted Desert to the Petrified Forest as its a fantastic array of colours stretching for miles and quite unlike anything I have seen before (other than when I was last here of course).

Painted Desert,"While the petrified logs are cool to see, you can only look at so many before you get your fill. For me, the best parts were the hikes down in the Blue Mesa and the Painted Desert. The Blue Mesa trail is paved, winding and short; it takes you down for an up-close view of the purple/grey/white badlands. Even better is the Painted Desert. The steep trail leading down into the desert can be accessed near the park's headquarters on the left side of the old Painted Desert Inn. Once you descend you will be able to walk through a sea of rolling umber red rock mounds without any restrictions (except you can't collect pieces of petrified wood as souvenirs). It's the only part of the park where you can pretty much wander where ever you want--in all the other parts you must stick to the short paved trails. You can even camp overnight if you choose. There is also a short trail that starts to the right of the inn and skirts the rim of the desert, but I recommend the trail that actually takes you down into the desert. Not a lot of people make it down there so it's easy to find solitude.","April 28, 2015","Fascinating trees, but the landscape is even more interesting",21,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

We were in the park for about an hour and that was not enough to fully enjoy each stop along the park road. The park has a lot of great turn offs for amazing views. I recommend allowing a few hours to really take the time to see each turn off; we spent most of our time driving and only went to a few of the turn-offs. We even saw a coyote as we were leaving the park!,"April 28, 2015",Great visit; beautiful scenery.,12,"Banff, Canada",5

Heading south, we were soon amid the ""teepees"" of the Blue Mesa, and then on to the Petrified Forrest where 200 million year old silica logs made me feel young indeed.

Painted Desert,"A must for all rockhounds and for folks who've never seen ""rocks"" like this. A most amazing monument to see. The trees are huge petrified chunks now, but when alive these trees must have been incredibly tall. The minerals that seeped in during petrification have made the most beautiful colors. The park store has polished specimens that you can buy and take home as well as other great southwestern art.

Painted Desert,Rocks that used to be trees - what's not to love?!? We spent about 1/2 a day going through the park and I wish we'd planned for longer! Our boys (ages 8 and 6) LOVE rocks and gained an even deeper appreciation after this park! We were all enthralled with the ruins and the glyphs - amazing! This park was well worth the trip and I would love to go again some day!,"April 21, 2015",Amazing!,13,,5
Painted Desert,"We drove in the south entrance where the petrified forest was located and walked through some of the paths behind the visitor's center. It was pretty cool to see and there are just tons of logs/stumps to see, but once you've seen a few, you've seen them all. The road then leads to the Painted Desert with numerous pullouts/views to take it. It was pretty, but we had seen a lot of the same things on the way down highway 89 from Grand Canyon, and the ""painted"" rocks we saw in Utah were even prettier. Would recommend the Blue Mesa view and the Kachina Point (sp?) if you don't have time to see everything. Also, they tell you Sunset is the best time to view them, but they close the gates at 7:00 p.m. and sunset wasn't until 6:56, so it doesn't give you much time to get out of the park.","April 20, 2015",A little goes a long way,110,"Rogers, Arkansas",3

There is a very nice walk you can take in the Forest that allows you to see a lot of the petrified wood in various sizes and shapes......they are quite beautiful! Unfortunately, the light wasn't good when we drove through the Painted Desert, so it wasn't as colorful as it could have been.

Last but not least there is the Painted Desert and the beautiful Blue Mesa.But the star attraction is the Petrified Forest itself. It is astonishing. At both ends of the 28 mile drive there is a visitors center at which one can learn how the wood was formed. The park rangers were friendly, helpful, and well informed. They welcomed questions and shared their knowledge, all while keeping an eye on this beautiful national treasure.","April 19, 2015",Astonishing,8,"St. Charles, Mo",5

The museum is nice, though we had a park ranger ""force"" our daughter to do the museum activity for the Jr. Ranger program... We normally complete the entire book but we had zero diapers left for our younger child, we were done with the required activities but they would not allow us to get the badge. Very frustrating. We definitely got a lot out of the museum but I think the ranger could have allowed us to take the oath and get the badge because she did complete the activities.In no way do I attribute our negative experience to the park but the individual ranger- but I think his heart was in the right space. She did learn a lot... \","April 7, 2015",Well laid out,6,"Boulder, Colorado",5
Painted Desert,"My teen age son wanted to visit the Grand Canyon during spring break. We added a couple of days to the trip to explore other locations in Arizona. A side trip east brought us to the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert National Parks. Our first trip though the parks featured the stop at Petrified Forest Visitor center and a drive by for the rest of park with a stop near the end to view the sunset.. At the visitors center we got a newspaper type information piece that we looked through that evening and discovered that there was much more to visit in the park. So a return trip the following morning brought us to a different painted desert with morning light that produced different hues from our earlier evening visit. Amongst several interesting stops, one special stop was our first view of petrographs made by early Native American residents on great chunks of rock. We were also amazed at the extent of the 'petrified forest' that included other stops beyond the visitor's center. Take your time when visiting these connected parks.

Painted Desert,The painted desert and the petrified forest are one park connected by a road that runs from one end to the other. I would recommend that you only start at the painted desert end if it is early in the morning as that along with evening is when the light is best. There are information ranger stations at both ends. There are multiple places to stop and see the features of both so allow yourself enough time. The ranger station at the petrified forest end has a nice short walk that describes how the forest came to exist and has some nice exhibits about the park. The crystal forest has an easy loop walk and interesting information along the way. Although you can only see newspaper rock from a distance it is worth seeing. The blue Mesa detour off the main route is well worth it for some beautiful and unique views of the area and some amazing colors. The painted desert is beautiful. The historic building in the painted desert is worth a stop. Try to be there early or late for the light on the hills. This is a great small park.,"April 4, 2015",Painted desert and petrified forest worth a stop,186,"Cranbury, New Jersey",5

The Painted Desert provided a colourful magnificent backdrop to our half day journey. Worth finding the old car in the middle of the desert where the old Route 66 was originally. It's a wonderfully quiet isolated time capsule in a unique setting. Give yourself at least four hours to drive through the length of the park, you will want to stop and do a couple of quick tours, and check on line beforehand when the gift shop closes. I didn't and hence missed out on buying a couple of lovely souvenirs. ","April 3, 2015","Gorgeous views, quiet, peaceful",77,"Milton, Canada",4

We did most of the hiking trails. We liked it so much that we decided to go back for a second day and hiked and drove in the south part. There isn't a lot of hiking, but many short trails. If you ask at the visitor center, they can tell you about some other areas where you can hike around off trail. It was very windy, don't know if it always is but I think it often is, so be prepared. We were there in February.","April 2, 2015",Beautiful,27,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5

Painted Desert,"Interesting? Yes, very! Beautiful? I'm not sure about this. Our visit starts with a very unfriendly Park Employee at the Entrance who barks at us orders about payment, interdiction to touch anything and the fact that they are ""Federally Protected"". This is YOUR Park, so prepare to pay YOUR fee. Next, prepare to denounce and incriminate your fellow co-owners of the Park (a green piece of paper is handed to you asking ""Who did it""?) Finally, get a map and start driving. The map is very detailed and tells you everything about the 28 mile drive and all the stops and hikes. The car roads are all paved with some space for parking in the more interesting locations. A major part of the drive is dull, deserted, even ugly at times. We did see a lonely pronghorn. This was a forest more than 200 million years ago. And we pretend we can manage nature!  All in all, it's worth seeing, because of its uniqueness. Also, I find the views of the Painted Desert much better than what I've seen so far (from the other side of the desert). But don't expect too much or you'll be disappointed, like I was.

I am glad I visited anyway. Views in this park aren't grand, there are no tall mountains or deep canyons. What you have are vividly colored small hills or mounds receding to the horizon. Colors of these mounds range from light pink to dark (almost brown) red and these colors change with quality of light. Great place to hone your photography skills. In the Petrified forest part of the park colors range from cream to violet (see attached photo) and there are horizontal bands of different colors on the same hill. Simply spectacular.

That is so not the case when you visit the Painted Desert & Petrified Forest. It is beautiful. The colors are vibrant. The rock formations are unique and inspiring. And, the petrified forest is unbelievable - literally. To look at something that looks like a huge tree covered in bark and then to touch it and realize that it is a very dense stone is just wild. And, those trees were living in that area over 215 million years ago. Crazy! Also.. the facilities are clean and well appointed.

Make sure you go in one of the 2 visitor centers (north and south entrances have them) and get a detailed map, which is in the park newspaper they have there. The guy working there was fantastic: he highlighted all of the must-see places in the park.You could probably spend 2 hours here if you have limited time.

Painted Desert,"PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK THE JOURNEY INTO THE PAST (ARIZONA’S HIDDEN BYWAYS IX) There are many destinations in the southwest United States that offer superb Red Rock vistas, as well as oddities. You can find them in Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. The beauty of PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK is not only the colored stone and landscape in the Painted Desert section and Teepees region, but the fossilized remains of a large number of ancient tree segments.  This large accumulation of petrified wood was a direct result of living trees being destroyed in a flood and quickly buried under silt and sand. Over the ensuing eons, the carbon atoms were replaced by silicon, resulting in uncovered sections of multi-colored petrified wood logs, branches, and wood segments. PLEASE NOTE: THE PETRIFIED WOOD WITHIN THE PARK IS TO STAY IN THE PARK! THIS IS NOT A SUPERMARKET FOR PETRIFIED WOOD COLLECTORS. THESE RULES ARE STRICTLY ENFORCED BY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL LEVY FINES, OR WORST, ON ANYONE CAUGHT REMOVING THIS MATERIAL FROM THE PARK. IF YOU DESIRE SOME SPECIMENS, THEY ARE ON SALE AT THE GIFT SHOP NEAR THE SOUTH ENTRANCE (i.e. COLLECTED OUTSIDE OF PARK BOUNDARIES).  There are numerous ways of arriving at this pristine destination. My favorite comes across from Flagstaff to the west via Route I-40E to EXIT 311E. This drive will take you past Meteor Crater, which, in my opinion, is overpriced and not worth the stop.  You can also come west from Albuquerque in the New Mexico via Interstate 40 West to EXIT 311W. If you require lodging in the area, and are not passing through to another destination, the town of Holbrook, AZ is your choice. It is located near the park and has lodging and food for the weary travelers. As you exit Interstate 40 at exit 311, you will go through the entrance station of the park (fee area) and get a map. You will be warned about collecting specimens of fossilize material. Be sure that you have drinking water with you, because this park can get very hot.  We prefer late morning/ afternoon lighting to bring out some of the colors if you are doing any photography. If you are using an SLR camera, use a polarizer for dramatic effect. Try to stop at all viewpoints in order to sample the various flavors of the park. Your first stop will be TIPONI POINT (see image). This, followed by TAWA POINT (see image) give the viewer a grand vista of the PAINTED DESERT, with all of its muted colors and stark scenery. Any classical music lover will remember the musical depiction of the Painted Desert in F. Grofe’s “Grand CANYON SUITE” If you are there in September, the yellow wildflowers may be in bloom, allowing for a juxtaposition of colors. It should be noted that there are hiking trails in this area. If you hike, water, food, emergency equipment (i.e. snakebite kit), and sturdy hiking boots are a necessity.  As the road makes a loop, you will stop at both KACHINA POINT and CHINDE POINT (see images), both exhibiting beautiful vistas of the small canyons and arroyos present in the Painted Desert area. Note the colorful bedding that the canyon walls are made up of. This is the direct geologic result of various layers of different material being deposited in shallow water and turned into metamorphic rock water over eons of time. Before the road doubles back and goes under Interstate 40, you can also make stops at WIPPLE AND LACEY POINTS. These viewpoints, while quite interesting and photogenic, are similar to the aforementioned viewpoints of the Painted Desert and can be skipped if you are pressed for time. If you have the time, linger in this area and enjoy the Painted Desert.  After going past the Interstate 40 junction (no access), you will drive a few miles through some rather boring terrain, stopping only at NEWSPAPER ROCK to see the Petroglyphs. You may want to ask a ranger in order to get a good sightline on these carvings in the rock left by the Native Americans. After Newspaper Rock, you enter Wonderland. The gates to this wonderland are the TEEPEES (see image), formations made up of the Blue Mesa Member. Pass these muli-colored hills, pull off the road at the turnout, get out of your vehicle, and marvel at these geologic layer cakes. They grey areas are most important for geologists because of the presence of fossilized material in these areas. From a photographic point of view, The Teepees are gems to be cherished and photographed under various lighting conditions. After experiencing the Teepees, we can move on south, passing a side road on your left going to BLUE MESA. The view from the Blue Mesa pullout offers extraordinary views of the surrounding area. The best lighting is afternoon lighting.AGATE BRIDGE is next, with the bridge being made up out of a REINFORCED petrified log. Walk around the small stone building (closed) and enjoy the bridge, and surroundings, from various angles. The view from THE JASPER FOREST VIEWPOINT is a view into a canyon full of petrified logs. From this distance, one can imagine the amount of petrified material prevalent in this section of the park. The problem with this stop is the inability to access these logs and get a close inspection of the material. Fortunately, there is THE CRYSTAL FOREST (see images), where you can climb the hill and get a close view of the petrified material. You can touch them, admire them, photograph them, but you cannot try to remove them. You will find that these agate petrified logs exhibit a rainbow of colors and shapes. A small amount of water will intensify the color palate. Wander through here and enjoy the ‘cherry on top of the cake’, because this is the main access to this material.PLEASE NOTE: THIS AREA IS HEAVILY PATROLLED BY RANGERS AND IS UNDER CONSTANT SURVALANCE, INCLUDING THE PARKING AREA. DO NOT REMOVE ANY MATERIAL!!!!  After spending some time here, and drooling over the specimens sitting in front of you, you can drive further south to the GIANT LOGS/ LONG LOGS area and view some giant log specimens. You will find rest rooms, a gift shop, and food in this area. You can also satisfy your craving for the petrified material at the gift shop, which has many polished specimens gleaned outside of the park for sale.  You will now exit the south entrance of the park. It should be noted that some vehicles may be stopped and searched for contraband petrified material. Continue straight from the entrance station to the junction of AZ US180, where you can make a right in order to return to Holbrook, AZ and Interstate 40 (East and West).  I hope that this information will be of some service when you visit the glorious part of Arizona.

Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest National Park is really the Petrified Forest and the Painted Desert and both are well worth the time to visit. The scenery and the views are tremendous, plus you can get out of your car at multiple locations and walk or hike and just get up close to everything, In our opinion it is as much of an attraction as the Grand Canyon with absolutely no crowds. You can easily spend the day here without seeing the same view twice. It is easy to get to, plus if you enter from the Holbrook area, you can continue through the entire park and exit farther east to I 40 so you don't have to double back on the same road.

We drove through and stopped at many of the pullouts, taking photos and walking around. Definitely worth the time spent there, and worth the time learning about how it was formed.

Painted Desert,A beautiful desert that is truly unique. Easy drive and easy paths to explore up close. Best seen late in the afternoon when the colors intensify and take on beautiful formations. Try to time it before the park closes (see hours on line) or go with a camera or photo club that can get special permits for sunrise and sunset photography. Rangers are nice but will chase you out if you linger without the special photography permit. You will need to Google local camera clubs unless you can find a specific photo trip.

The Painted Desert was unbelievable. At different times of the day the colors are different, but they are always vivid and breathtaking. One of the things I liked about this park is that you can stop anywhere you wish and take pictures or just look. In addition to these two parts of the park there is also the indian petroglyphs and the Painted Desert Inn.

Painted Desert,"Petrified Forest NP provides a great opportunity to get up close to see the effects of time, climate and the environment on trees and the landscape.Depending on the time of day and the lighting conditions you see a variety of colors and textures that are a far cry from the original. The petroglyphs, badlands and views of the Painted Desert are worth the drive through, and many sites are only a brief walk from the car. The Painted Desert Inn was a pleasant surprise and contrast from looking at the scenery.We obtained permits to hike the newly opened Devil's Playground section (no marked trails) but had some navigation challenges even with topo maps. Saw some hoodoos, roaming cattle and a lot of mud, but due to limited time could not venture too far into the area.","March 17, 2015",Interesting look back in time,43,Metro Boston,4
Painted Desert,"Driving West from Santa Fe to Flagstaff.  Stopped enroute to see the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest which was amazing!!  Here's the link: http://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htmlStop at the visitor’s center for information and to pay the entry fee. There is a $10 fee per car, good for 10 days, unless you’re a senior in which you can get a lifetime pass to all national parks for $10! That's a great deal, a lifetime pass for the price of a single site visit. Westbound Interstate 40 travelers should take Exit 311, drive the 28 miles through the park and connect with Highway 180 at the south end. Travel 19 miles on Highway 180 North to return to Interstate 40 at Holbrook, AZ.Eastbound Interstate 40 travelers should take Exit 285 into Holbrook then travel 19 miles on Highway 180 South to the park's south entrance. Drive the 28 miles north through the park to return to Interstate 40. The park follows a 28 mile road through the wilderness. No trees, fences, lights, people, animals, etc. for 28 miles of great scenery – just as it was before humans arrived. There are plenty of photogenic overlooks and there’s a paved walk, about a mile, through the highest density of petrified trees. There is also a preserved Inn that is on the original Highway 66 within the park staffed by rangers who apparently live on site and raved about the night sky. We approached from the East and saw the Painted Desert overlook first and then drove the 28 miles south through the Petrified Forest areas. We exited at the South end of the park to connect to highway 128 and go north to get back onto highway 40. There's a warning sign that our vehicle may be examined for petrified we might have picked up - which is prohibited - but the examination station was not attended. Just outside the park gate are stands selling petrified wood, pretty rocks, etc by the pound. Apparently there are plenty of petrified wood samples for sale outside the park boundaries. In fact, on the 19 mile drive to connect to highway 40 to the north there are many, many petrified logs on the ground on private property. Like everyone else I shot hundreds of pictures while we were here, but other reviewers have covered the photo opportunities as well or better than anything I could add.Because of our travel schedule, we spent only about three hours on this loop, but could have easily spent an entire day. If you can find a suitable motel nearby, this would warrant an overnight stop. Highly recommended!","March 16, 2015","Awesome Land, easily viewed",221,St Louis,5

There are several scenic stops with explanatory signs. Even from the car you can see why the Spanish gave it this name! You can enter a no-longer used small inn in which had more common rooms than guest rooms! Very retro.

Either way, don't miss it. One helpful hint--the north and south visitors' centres have the same stuff and show the same film, so you only need to stop for one. Another hint--make sure you stop for at least one of the scenic overlooks north of I40--the views of the Painted Desert are spectacular and should not be missed.","March 12, 2015",Well worth the trip,98,"Ottawa, Canada",5
Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest National Park should be on your bucket list if you're at all interested in stepping back in time and seeing some beautiful geology.

The Painted Desert is an artists canvas of color and there are numerous short and easy walks/hikes you can take to further your adventure. If you want a longer, more difficult hike, those are out there as well. Be sure and hydrate well and carry plenty of water with you. All petrified wood and other objects are protected in this park and cannot be removed. There is a lot of life here as well as ancient history in the form of petroglyphs as found at Newspaper Rock. If you're just driving through doing some of the short hikes, one day would be enough, however, if you want to explore a bit, two or more days are possible.

Painted Desert,"There is a HUGE Amount of Petrified Wood from tropical trees that grew here 200 million years ago. There are many areas where you are able to get a close look at and handle this petrified wood. As with all National Parks, nothing can be removed. There are also many trails available to walk or hike. All the trails are an easy walk and most are paved. There is a museum at the south end of the park just off Hwy. 180. Outside the back door of this museum is an easy paved trail that meanders around and through a huge amount of petrified wood. Here you will walk past a 10 foot in diameter petrified tree stump that is sure to get your attention. This trail is perhaps 0.5 mile in length.The ""Blue Mesa"" trail is about a mile in length, round trip, and is also paved. We took this trail on a sunny afternoon and were captivated by the beauty of the smallish canyons with the variety of color and shadows. Along most of this trail you will also see lots of petrified wood, some an small as wood chips and others as large logs. There is elevation to get down to the canyons and back up. We highly recommend taking this trail.We also walked the 0.5 mile easy paved trail around a Native American village site. There is information posted throughout this trail explaining the daily life of this pre-history village. This is a loop trail.There are other trails available, all of which are easy & paved. In addition, you will have numerous pull-offs to observe the scenery and additional petrified wood. The Visitor Center is located just off I-40. This Visitor Center covers both the Petrified Forest and the adjacent Painted Desert. There is a restaurant & store adjacent to the Visitor Center. Approximately 0.5 miles NE of the Visitor Center is the 100 year old ""Painted Desert Inn"" which is maintained as is was in the late 1940's. You get a real look at what a traveler would experience in over-night lodging during this era.This Inn is staffed by the park service. We found the Petrified Forest very interesting.

Painted Desert,A fascinating tour - you can do it as a drive through if time is limited and still see much of the sights. Hiking the off-trail areas is permitted and gets you away from the stop and see folks.,"January 17, 2015",A Must See,16,Bettendorf,5
Painted Desert,"First, there isn't actually a forest. This is not about standing trees. What are here are partial tree trunks, many of them broken, laying on their sides in random configurations around the park - which is an approx 30 mile long drive with lots of interesting places to stop along the way. The tree parts are completely turned to stone now.Along the 30 mi drive are marked hiking trails highlighting some of the different colors and configurations of the surrounding desert area. At the south end of the park is a rangers station with a museum, gift shop, etc so we were glad we stopped there first. They sell an audio CD for about $10usd for your car that talks you through the drive. There's also a short free film that explains the petrified forest and its origins. It was worth the couple hours' drive from Flagstaff to see.This is a national park, so national park passes will give you a discount on admission.Note that the north end of the drive is the south part of the painted forest. It's a single destination, so I don't understand why these are separately reviewed on trip advisor. It's a single trip and I'm not sure whether you can avoid doing both parts?","January 17, 2015",Worth a look,43,"Rockville, MD",4
Painted Desert,"Even on a cold and cloudy day the Painted Desert was awe-inspiring and absolutely beautiful. The petrified wood is cool, too, although when you see the piles of it for sale outside the park it loses some its specialness. Lots of well-marked viewpoints ensure that you see the desert and wood specimens from every vantage point. The petroglyphs are very cool. There are even a few short trails that let you stretch your legs and get closer to the wonders.","January 16, 2015",Literally awesome,53,"Oberlin, Ohio, United States",4

Painted Desert,"As we were going across country on I 40, we took a break to stretch our legs, since I 40 runs right through the middle of the park. I was very glad we did. Since we have the national Park Senior Pass(Absolutely the Best deal going) it did not cost us any additional admission fee. It was a weekday two weeks before Christmas, and the park basically deserted. We enjoyed seeing the old hotel and history about the Harvey girls. What amazed me was how close we could get to the ancient Petroglyphs when we walked through the desert trail. I also loved the beauty of the sections the petrified trees. Even the unpolished ones were like giant gemstones. I wish I had had more time, but we needed to move on.","January 14, 2015",A welcome break on a long drive,13,,3

The colors are so beautiful and the hills/mountains/mesas with all of their pastels will have you in awe of mother nature.

I cant even wrap my mind around the fact that these giant trees turned to stone are 225 million years old! If you can, stop before the park entrance to buy some petrified wood (you are not allowed to take it from the park!). You will need at least 4 hours to go through it and the painted desert. Take advantage of all of the stops and hikes, as many photos as you take, you will get home and feel like you didnt take enough! Sometimes there are special hikes that you can do but you have to go early and get permits to do them (they are limiting access to certain areas in order to keep them untouched).

Painted Desert,"The Painted desert and petrified forest National Park was one of the highlights of my recent Route 66 road trip. It was a 35 (or so) mile scenic drive through the park with lots of parking areas with short easy walks to scenic view points. It took us hours to wind our way through the park and even then I felt rushed as there were walking trails that we hadn't had time to explore. Although the petrified forest/logs was interesting to read about I though the 'painted desert' was visually much more spectacular. My advice is to factor in 3-4 hours to see this properly. We arrived after lunch and left just before the park closed at sunset and I suspect the sunlight would have been more impressive in the morning, remembering we were there in winter ..","January 10, 2015",Awesome detour when driving from Alburquerque to Winslow,299,,5
Painted Desert,"I was always intrigued by the idea of petrified wood and finally got to visit the Petrified Forest National Park last summer The petroglyphs on Newspaper Rock and Painted Desert are prime examples of why you should save more time to savor sights in the National Park System: they often offer more than their names suggest! The painted desert was a wonderful sight with the red rock & contrasting blue skies. There is a short hike you can go on to explore the area a bit. We stayed at Holbrook and visited the Painted Desert first (entering via the North Entrance) simply because the color of the rock shows better in the morning than in the afternoon. Even in May, the temperatures were pretty high so make sure you wear sunscreen & stock up on water.","January 10, 2015",Multi-hued rock in a desert landscape,99,"Seattle, Washington",4

Painted Desert,"Just off I-40, exit 311, only a 1/2 mile drive to see Petrified Forest National Park. Cost $10 which is good for 7 days per vehicle. You can easily see the park in less than 1 day, unless you will be hiking various trails. We visited in late November and was too cold and windy to do much hiking. But the sites from the vehicle and several overlooks and shorts trails were doable. Stop by the visitor's center to speak with a ranger and get a feel for what you would like to see and do based upon the amount of time you have to enjoy the park. The summer would having longer park hours but during the fall the park hours were 8am-5pm. There is no overnight lodging in the park. WE opted to drive an hour plus to Flagstaff to stay the night before our trip to the Grand Canyon (the lodging in the small towns near the park are more like old motels and the area seemed unsafe). Make sure you check out the Newspaper rock which is about half way through the park. The entire park is a 28 mile drive.","January 9, 2015","Wow, what a beauty! No Crowds either",72,"Dallas, Texas",4

The rock formations & colorings are very beautiful. It reminded me of the Badlands of South Dakota at times. There is one trail that we didn't have time to take that goes down around some of the formations. It is paved and would be a nice hike to take.

Saw this on the map, turned into the north entrance, talked to a ranger and took his advice for a detour. So glad we did. Not an overwhelming vista, like many other places in the Southwest, but a very sedate, subtle landscape with the pastel colors best absorbed and appreciated slowly.

I would recommend starting at the south entrance and driving north on the park road. I was amazed at how much petrified wood is laying right on the surface. Stop first at the Southern visitor center to see the introductory video and displays. Then take the short loop walk to get your first viewing of the ancient trees. There are several trails within the park. I wish we'd had more time. We spent about 3 hours and I wanted more. Once you've finished with the Petrified Forest, drive to the connected Painted Desert.

Painted Desert,My first planned stop was Petrified Forest National Park just across the border in Arizona. I had picked up an hour so it was only 10.10 as I pulled into the visitor’s center. My plan to explore by bike quickly evaporated when I realized the area was larger than I had anticipated. In fact with the two hours I had available I could only really explore half the park.It divides into two clear areas – the Painted Desert and the Badlands where you find the petrified trees. The desert comes first and is viewed from a series of vista points that overlook the amazing landscapes below. It truly lives up to its name – the multi hued rock formations really would cover an artist’s palette. I chose to explore an area of the badlands called Blue Mesa. It was about eighteen miles to the loop that took me off the main road that interestingly enough is the old Route 66. The loop has a series of lookouts some with petrified logs showing but overall my impression was of some disappointment. There really is not much of a forest visible; there are pieces of fragmented fossils and at times it looks a bit like a badly managed clear cut. However the geology is spectacular. I reached a one-mile walking route that took me into the Badlands below and this was fascinating and the highlight of my visit' This is an area where prehistorically vast flows of water and sediment were laid down very quickly and buried the trees that were there. In fact buried them so quickly and so densely that they did not decay in the usual manner. Over time the sheer weight and time changed them to petrified wood.,"November 29, 2014",Incredible Geology,7,"Vancouver, Canada",4
Painted Desert,"It was the scale of this place that really amazed me. Not just one or two pieces of petrified wood but tons and tons of it lying in the desert. Apparently the most colourful parts were taken years ago by sightseers but there are still plenty of examples in reds, yellows and blues that are just fascinating. We went at the end of the day and, along with the Arizona sunset, it was quite lovely. Went back the next morning for another and walked a few miles amongst it.

Painted Desert,My family and I were just amazed at the geology present in the national park. The Painted Desert was spectacularly beautiful with its color caused by the different mineral layers. The Petrified Forest was just as awesome especially when one considers how long it took for the wood cellulose to be completely replaced by silica. It is an awe-inspiring place. The history too is very interesting especially the old ruins of a once bustling native American village.

Painted Desert,"The park has some very nice areas between which you have to drive. The park has a good trip planner / newspaper which contains a reasonable map outlining the whole park. Hiking can be done but only on unmarked trails. Rough maps for individual unmarked hikes can be obtained from the visitor center, but they can be quite inaccurate and do not show sufficient detail. Accompanying written hike descriptions also do not always describe the correct or best route to take. When told about inaccuracies discovered on the maps or descriptions, the rangers' typical response is a polite acknowledgement but one senses that nothing will be done about it.

Painted Desert,"The north end of the approx 30 mile Petrified Forest National park drive runs through the southern tip of the painted desert. It seemed a little confusing to us, but this is one-and-the-same as the petrified forest park drive. It really shouldn't be a separate review on Trip Advisor.We drove starting from the south at Hwy 180 (you can go either direction) to plan our arrival in the painted desert area toward sunset. There are about 8 points in the painted desert portion of the drive where you can pull over for photos. If you don't have time for all of them, I suggest these 3: route 66, Pintado point, and Kachina point. Rte 66 stop is the old famous rte 66 which has been reclaimed a bit by the desert. There is a romantic old rusted car and electricity poles lining the route. The paved road is no longer visible from here. It's a fun stop for a quick photo... shouldn't take long at all.Pintado Point offers western-facing vistas of the desert and the mountains in the distance with maybe 300 degree views of the surrounding area. Very nice for your panoramic photos. Kachina point has a red adobe? Building with restrooms and points facing both east and north facing for photo opportunities.For best photo opportunities, it depends on what you want to capture: facing the western sky at sunset will capture the sky, but may not get the desert colors. Facing north may capture the sunlight on the dunes and highlight the amazing colors of the sands, but maybe not the colors of the sky. The vibrancy of the colors of the desert are really light-dependent and may look flat midday, but still nice to see.Park admission includes both the petrified forest and this section of the desert. Since it is a national park, national park passes work here -- which may save money if you plan to see multiple parks.For this section of the park, I'd recommend about an hour -- but that's not including the petrified forest section... which is another 2-3 hrs depending on whether you want to hike the easy hiking trails on that part and how many you want to hike.Fill your gas tank on your way there... there's no gasoline stations inside the park.","November 3, 2014",A setting sun REALLY brings out the colors,43,"Rockville, MD",4

Painted Desert,Honestly for me once was enough...although in all honesty this was my 2nd trip. The first was probably 40 yrs ago... ugh makes you feel old. Anyway for me once every 40 yrs is enough. That said the petrified wood was interesting to see and the desert was particularly stunning at sunset.

Painted Desert,We visited the Painted Desert and Petrified Forest National Park in October and found it very interesting and not very crowded at all. Painted Desert is like you are in another world with all the colors and very desolate scene. Great photo opportunities. When you show your photos to friends it might be a bit difficult to explain. Very scenic. The Petrified Forest part is also very interesting with all the ancient petrified wood. Make sure you stop at the visitor center museum on the south end because they have a great variety of petrified wood behind the building.,"October 25, 2014","A very beautiful, colorful area. Not crowded in October.",133,"Naples, Florida",5
Painted Desert,"When I was planning my cross-country trip with my friend, he told me that we had to stop at the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert. I trusted his opinion, but wasn't really thinking it was going to be a big part of our trip. I could not have been more wrong. This place blew my mind with the natural beauty that makes you feel at points like you are on another planet. There is no way to explain to someone how unique you feel in the middle of some of these landscapes. Even the pictures, and I have a great camera, don't properly show the awe of this place. As for the accommodations that are easier to describe......................1) Entering the park costs $10.00 per car, and they will make sure that you don't take anything with you besides pictures and memories. Be prepared to tell the person who welcomes you if you have any rocks, sand, or other natural nick-nacks in your car. 2) The park does a very good job of providing a number of different stops to get out of the car and wander. 3) You get to see the original location of Route 66, which is a pretty interesting study in American culture. The road is completely covered in grass, but you can still see the telephone poles that followed the famous route. 4) The petrified wood was not as impressive as I thought, and the Painted Desert is definitely the focus of this park. 5) Make sure not to skip Newspaper Rock (we did skip it), because it is covered in Petroglyphs. 6) There is a small gift shop as you are leaving, and you will want to check out some remarkable postcards with great shots of the natural beauty. 7) Don't be afraid to stroll away from the normal path where allowed. You will feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, while some of the designed stops get a bit crowded.","October 24, 2014",Good Luck Explaining It To Your Friends And Family,36,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA",5

Lots of pull offs for some great photo opportunities. Something different and interesting at every turn. Information signs at most of the pull offs. The petrified wood was very unique. We would recommend stopping at the visitor center before going on the 28 mile tour. There is a minimal fee to get in, but it is good for 7 days. If we would have had more time, we probably would have gone through again.","October 20, 2014",Amazing!,12,Sevierville,5
Painted Desert,"WOW, This is a GREAT family adventure full of ancient history, geologic marvels beautiful colors and FUN. You cannot view these beautiful sites without turning off the freeway. Take the short drive off the hwy and be absolutely amazed. The Painted Desert is a photagrapher/artist's dream. The beautiful pastel hues are in constant flux, depending on the light. The Petrified tree logs are literally all over the place. Each one is a kalidescope of color, textures and patterns. Both areas are extremely child friendly. However, it is always best to watch the young ones closely as there are areas with vistas and sharp dropoffs outside the safety zones. Some hazardous flora and fauna may also be encountered by the overly curious adventurer. Please use caution and be attentative. There are many paved and unpaved, well marked and maintained paths, with ample parking available throughout the 28 mile drive. The Museum and Visitor Centers have clean facilities as do the gift shops. There are covered picnic areas at the southern entrance near the museum and a snackbar at the giftshop. The National Park Service will give you a complimentary, info-packed, handout that can guide you through all the beautiful and unique attractions. Remember, to take plenty of water during the summer months. This is a GREAT family adventure. Have Fun!","October 20, 2014",Painted Desert and Petrified Forest ROCKS!,107,"Cottonwood, Arizona",5
Painted Desert,"It was an hour and a half from our base in Flagstaff but well worth the trip. You can enter from the south which starts in the Petrified Forest, or the north, starting in the painted desert. I reommend starting in the petrified forest. It is a long road off I40 avoid the 2 commercial giant giftshops just before the entrance: the sanctioned gift shop in the park has much better prices. If you are interested in Hopi art, go to the reservation for best prices, or the gift shop at the North Arizona Museum in Flagstaff). The visitors center has an excellent orienting film that runs continuously, some amazing preJurassic fossils, and fronts the Long Log pathway which is amazing (but lots of steps). The Crystal Forest pathway is an easy walk with spectacular scenery. As you edge into the painted desert proper, amazing natural formations, looking like teepees and hogans arise. Some walks are easy, others, like that of the Blue Mesa, more challenging, but the Rangers are very helpful in telling you about them. At any time of day the colors of the desert are amazing reds, yellows, black, blue. My husband is of the opinion that in its unique way, this is a comparable site to the Grand Canyon.","October 20, 2014",Do not miss these wonders if you can!,63,ATLANTA,5

Painted Desert,"We entered the petrified forest NP from the 180 (ignore the enormous gift shops on either side). The fee for entering the park is very reasonable and certainly gives value for money as we spent about 5 hours exploring the different areas. We visited the crystal forest first-this is a short walk which gives you a chance to see an awful lot of petrified wood. I can't describe how odd it is, you'll just have to visit. We continued our drive through the desert, stopping at various viewing points including the agate bridge, until we reached the turn off for the Blue Mesa.The Blue Mesa itself is at the far point of the loop, so you can stop at each view point or just keep going until you reach the walking trail. If you have an hour or so and enough energy, I'd really recommend the trail. It is all paved, so although it gets quite steep in places there is nothing tricky. The landscape here is extraordinary, it looks like a different planet.After the Blue Mesa, we drove on to the painted desert itself, arriving just at sunset. The viewpoints are cleverly positioned to give you the best possible contrast between the different geological featueres. Extremely low angle of the light showed all the different colours to their best advantage and it looked gorgeous. I have visited a lot of amzing and beautiful places, the painted desert is the best place to see a sunset anywhere.","October 15, 2014",Breathtaking beauty,59,"Poole, United Kingdom",5
Painted Desert,"Driving back from Albuquerque, I wanted to check out the Painted Desert. I met people in NM who advised I should just go to Sedona instead. However, the Painted Desert had always been on my list and decided to go for it; I'm really glad I did. If you're entering from I-40, the first part of this park is the Painted Desert. If you're entering from the south, you will start in the petrified forest area, just FYI. You do end up looping through both areas regardless of where you start. As far as the eye can see, you're presented with the cinematic landscapes of the desert. It just seems to go on and on. The colors of the desert can't compare and are just so majestic and rich. There are many great trials (both easy and a bit more difficult). Unfortunately, time did not allow me to venture these paths. From what I saw, though, the paths could lead to areas that afford grander views of the desert. There are many viewpoints dotted throughout the drive that allow for varying views. It costs $10 per vehicle to enter the park which is well worth the fee. Essentially, you're seeing two parks for the price of one. The park is minimalist, don't expect it to be a Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. If you appreciate natural beauty, like to hike or get swept away by the desert, the Painted Desert is a must.","October 13, 2014",Holy Wow,244,"Portland, Oregon",5

Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest is an area where a 200 million year old forest became preserved under volcanic ash, and then petrified into amazing colours. There are about a dozen different types of tree, and this is one of the largest concentrations of petrified trees in the world. Visitors can visit a museum explaining the geology, and then drive around a huge area with numerous parking points which allow access to trails. About 200-300 years ago, a Spanish explorer stood and looked at the badlands and mesas with their logs of all different colours and called the region El Desierto Pintado-the Painted Desert. The landscape is rugged and awe inspiring. It is a truly amazing visit.","October 12, 2014",Fascinating visit,118,"Winchester, United Kingdom",5

Painted Desert,"On our way to Flagstaff, AZ, we decided to stop at Petrified Forest National Park, off Highway 40 / Route 66, and boy were we glad. The Painted Desert is one of many sites that you will encounter throughout the park.The Painted Desert Rim: This was our first stop near the north entrance and it was amazing. You will see a vast red-colored desert with many hills that contain layers of different colored sediments. Take as many pictures as you can. You will not regret this stop. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK:Pros: It's inexpensive; we paid $10 per car. There are several amenities such as a restaurant at the Painted Desert Visitor center, gift shops located at the entrance and exits of the Park, several restrooms throughout the park, several points of interest that are just as breathtaking as the Grand Canyon, paved roads throughout the 28-mile park from end to end, it's an approved ADA facility for those with wheelchairs. The park accepts cash and credit card. There is a gas station at the North entrance (not sure if it was working or not, since we did not use it, but gas was pricey in comparison to other gas stations).Cons: ""Federal law prohibits collecting petrified wood, fossils, rocks, plants, animals, and archeological objects"", and rightfully so. If you want future generations to experience this park, do not collect the petrified wood. There is a gift store outside the Petrified Forest National Park, near the south entrance/exit, that sells petrified wood that has been collected from private lands. Opinions: If you appreciate Nature and hikes, then The Petrified Forest National Park is a must. It is an all-in-one park with many points of interest such as, stunning red deserts, petrified forest, petroglyphs, mars-looking hills, and Indian pueblo ruins. In my humble opinion, it was equal in beauty in comparison to the Grand Canyon, if not more. Recommendations: Take sunscreen, plenty of water, hats, and I highly recommend you take your camera with plenty of memory cards. Take a snack with you. If you have an hour to spend, drive through the park and make stops here and there. If you have several hours to spend, walk some of the trails; they can be rewarding. Be cautious of snakes and other desert animals that may be harmful; we encountered a snake underneath a bush, near one of the walkway trails. Also, be cautious of cliffs and slippery slopes. Look at the website for additional information. I highly recommend you visit this hidden gem. You will NOT regret it.","September 9, 2014",Amazng,94,"Houston, Texas",5

We arrived about an hour before sunset, and the shadows were dramatic, but the colors not as bright. We didn't have much time, as the park was closing in less than an hour after we arrived. I would have liked to spend more time just sitting and looking at the landscapes. Definitely a place to relax and enjoy the scenery, or wait for the light to change for great photos. The visitor center had good exhibits but on a smaller scale than at the south visitor center. They have a small souvenir shop, and next door is a convenience market and gas station.

The Blur Mesa was also a nice photo shop. The painted desert was during the midday sun. Therefore, we did not see all the colors. It was muted by sunshine.Overall, it is a good park for 3 hours. We learned the geological history of the area so that is a plus. The park just doesn't compare to the big ones in the area.

Painted Desert,"We had already been to the Grand Canyon on this same trip and were blown away by that.Then we arrived at the Painted Desert - outstanding.Then, we stopped at the Petrified Forest - mind-blowing.The magnificent crystals that mother nature has formed in the trees over the centuries are something that you have to see in person.No pictures can prepare you.","August 16, 2014",Never Saw Anything Like It,76,"Bay Village, Ohio",5
Painted Desert,"We drove up through Payson into Holbrook at started our trek there. We stopped at the Visitor's station so my kids could do the Junior Ranger Program (great for young kids - they get patches (sometimes) and pins and do little activities). Behind the station, there was a lot of petrified wood you could go out back and see and touch. After we left there, we drove the 28 mile road up to the Painted Desert. As you come into it, you come to the top of the hill, (it was sunset) and the colors literally took my breath away. Best place Ive seen in Arizona so far. The Grand Canyon is gorgeous, but the colors of the Painted Desert is amazing. So much to see on your drive through. We didn't stop to hike but many areas for photo ops. Worth it to me.","August 13, 2014",Natural beauty in the middle of a desert,48,"Cocoa Beach, Florida",5
Painted Desert,"My 60yr old mother with with my on this trip but none of the options really fit..Anyway, we entered at the south entrance and drove the 26 mile loop to the north entrance where we them could get right back on 40 and continue our drive. GPS will take you to the north entrance so be aware of that so you don't backtrack! Lots of beautiful sites here and interesting history. Can get through the whole park in ~3hours but could have easily spent more time. Great photo ops","August 12, 2014",Very cool,8,,4
Painted Desert,"Another great stop for those on Rt66. At the main entrance to the park there is a visitor centre, café and gift shop. We picked up a map in the visitor centre and then had a bite to eat before we set off on our drive through the park.The map lists the viewing points, many of which have walking trails leading from them. Despite it being very overcast and raining off and on, we spent about two hours in the park. There are some amazing views in the park. The scenery is awesome – there’s so much of it you are in danger of becoming a bit immune to its “wow” factor.As we were heading to Holbrook it meant we didn’t have to drive back up through the Forest we exited the park at the bottom and continued on our journey on the US180.The Parks Service are extremely keen to ensure that none of the petrified wood is removed from the park, there are warning sign everywhere – you can of course buy plenty of it in the gift shop!This was a great stop, and I’d recommend it to anyone.","August 11, 2014",Awesome,205,"Halifax, United Kingdom",5
Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest National Park is really two parks in one. It has one long road leading from north to south. If you start at the northern end as we did, you are actually in the Painted Desert part of the park. There is a visitor centre here which is certainly the place to start. As you drive south you encounter lots of viewing points where you can stop and admire. There are information boards explaining the formations if you are interested, or you can just look and be enchanted by the shapes and colours that surround you.As you head further south you will enter the Petrified Forest Section.","August 9, 2014",Two parks in one,202,"London, United Kingdom",5

Painted Desert,When I was young I remember going on the old Route 66 and seeing the Painted Desert once. My wife had never seen it and so we traveled from Alabama to see this wonderful site. It is truly a magnificent site to behold how all the natural colors blend together to create a painting that no human hands can match. This is well worth the trip or side trip if you are traveling through the area anyway. Would be worth being a bus load of friends here to experience this.,"August 6, 2014",Reclaiming past memories,68,"Phenix City, Alabama",5

Painted Desert,"Being from the east coast, the landscape of the southwest was completely new to us. This was the first place we stopped on our road trip out west this summer. It was unlike anything we had ever seen before. The Painted Desert has amazing scenery for miles. The Petrified Forest was also truly spectacular. If you have kids definitely do the Junior Ranger program. You can pick up the packet at the Visitor Center and it keeps the kids occupied and engaged as you drive through the park (it's about 25 miles of driving getting out every mile or so). At the end they have to write an ""essay"" (I gave my 6 year old a little help), and then they get sworn in as Junior Rangers. One tip...there are bathrooms along the route, but they are just glorified outhouses. So if you get squeamish about that, there are ""normal"" bathrooms at the visitor centers at the end of the park.","August 5, 2014",Like nothing I had seen before,24,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest is as amazing as the Grand Canyon. It´s a natural beauty where mother earth worked quite well. It´s located in the Navajo and Apache countries, in Arizona.The reason I think it´s not excellent is related to the National Park, which is good, but not as organized and easy to navigate as it´s the National Park in the Grand Canyon.During a road trip through California, Arizona and New Mexico, in our way from Sedona to Albuquerque, my family and I spent half day visiting this forest. It was far from being enough. We only covered the Painted Desert and half of the park. Even dough in a superficial way. It was enough to see the Kachina Point, the Painted Desert Inn museum, the Pueblo ruins, the Newspaper rock and the Blue Mesa (if I´m not missing something we covered).We kept it in our to do list for next time, the Crystal Forest , the giant logs and the Rainbow Forest museum, which we didn´t have time.In any case, it was a big learning experience. I never saw petrified wood before. This area has some 380 km2 and was declared a US National Monument in 1906 and a National Park in 1962. It has a huge deposit of petrified wood from the late triassic (about 225 millions of years ago) and fossils from plants, reptiles, amphibians and early dinosaurs. It was discovered that the area has about 600 archeological sites. The first humans to live there arrived some 8000 years ago and the sites from the pueblos we saw dated from 1400 years ago.It was a pity, but we had not planned for the Petrified Forest until getting to the Grand Canyon, when we saw that our route would cross the forest. So we decided to stop by. However, this is not a place that you just stop by. This is a place to spend a day or a bit more in order to get to know its richness.","August 5, 2014",A natural treasure,397,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",4
Painted Desert,"Whether you enter the park at the grandeur of the northern Painted Desert or the southern stark beauty of the Petrified Forest, take the route with enough time to walk some of the trails and stop at the visitor centers.

Painted Desert,"If you love unique scenery or enjoy landscape photography, you shouldn't miss this park. The story of the petrified wood is interesting. Two gift shops right before you enter the park hold a treasure trove of petrified souvenirs, fossils and other such goodies, but for my money...the Painted Desert is the real jewel here. The blending and contrasting colors are a treat for the eyes. I will put a picture on here...but I only had my cell phone cam and I assure you, it doesn't capture the real beauty. Go. See for yourself. Take a GOOD camera along.","August 2, 2014",Scenery EVERYWHERE!,16,,4
Painted Desert,"We visited Petrified Forest National Park in Mid-May. The Painted Desert is the attraction. Only spend time in the petrified area if you have never seen petrified wood before, otherwise it might not be worth the trip. You can do this park and the Painted Dessert in half a day. The down side is the “non-Painted Desert” part of the park makes you feel like a criminal as soon as you get there. Signs everywhere announcing fines. While I understand the need to protect the remaining petrified wood from being taken, I do not agree with their draconian methods. This place has more rules than a prison camp. They encourage you to call in to report other visitors and they even have a, rarely open, vehicle inspection station with signs warning it is ahead.The weather was not too warm, but the day we were there was very windy. There is not a bit of shade anywhere in the park so if you go on a walk take a hat and plenty of water. The sun gets really hot even when the air is cool. As you drive toward the Painted Desert you will have places to pull off and check out some of the logs on display. You are not allowed to go off the short trails. After a few stops it gets to be about the same thing in each area, but the surrounding landscape begins to change.The view of the Painted Desert is hard to see in pictures. Some show it as more brilliant than it really is and others show it washed out. Something you should have on your list of things to see. I have been out west a few times and drove 3,000 miles in desert terrain on this trip and have never seen layers quite like these. Most will just drive through this area and stop for some photo ops. It is mostly open desert and not too inviting for hikers.","August 2, 2014",The Painted Desert is the reason to come,231,"Chardon, Ohio",5
Painted Desert,"Online pictures, descriptions, and postcards will ever do this Park justice. Must been seen.We serendipitously stopped at the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest Visitor's Center on I-40 in eastern Arizona for a break. We were in no real hurry to get down the road, and after visiting with staff for a bit, decided to take the car tour of the Park.I had no idea!We were there on a day when there were a few passing clouds and one or two rainshowers, but these just added stark relief to the beauty of this park. As we were standing on one of the overlooks on Blue Mesa, we talked just how long it had been since we had been in a place where the only thing you heard was the wind, and occasional rumble of thunder, and birds.We spent 6 wonderful hours enjoying the approximately 30 mile trip through the Park and have already started making plans to return near dawn or dusk in the future to be able to enjoy the wildlife.","August 2, 2014","Dirt, Rocks, Wildlife, Quiet",30,"Norman, Oklahoma, United States",5
Painted Desert,"Very scenic park. It has more than just rocks. There is a lot of native history in the park (dwellings, petroglyphs), nice visitors center. We were here in July and the park can be brutally hot. Be sure to bring plenty of water if visiting in the summer. The hikes are short but there is NO cover of any sort along the trails. A small cooler with a few cold waters was appreciated. We spent most of a day in the park soaking up the history and taking a lot of scenery photographs. Bring drinks, hats and anything to make walking in the heat more comfortable. I always wear light weight white cotton T shirts in the summer and a big floppy hat. I have several spare shirts in the car for when one gets too sweaty. Wear comfy shoes and cover up or bring sunscreen (there is VERY little shade). I saw people wearing dark clothes that looked like they were about to melt. I'd avoid dark clothes in the desert South West at ALL times during the summer. Watch the weather, it doesn't rain much but when it does it can be more dangerous than the heat!","July 31, 2014",Spent a good day here. Come prepared.,124,"Midland, Texas",5
Painted Desert,"Our concierge at our resort told us it would only take us about 2 hours to do the park. We drove from Sedona and entered the park from the southeast side. We first hit the petrified forests and spent time at the center. We didn't wait for a tour or the movie. I have seen petrified wood before but this is the only place where the rainbow petrified wood comes from. We made most of the stops on the park map. There are several pueblos and structures and explanations about the formations of the painted dessert and the forest. This took us most of the day. There is a restaurant further north, but we didn't stop. I was surprised at how many cars just drove on through the park without making in stops. It is hot.

But after driving a few miles into the area, I started seeing the layers of colors, one on top of the other like a jar of colored sand layers. It looked just like the photos I saw as a young girl. The colors were beautiful. I liked the fact that we could park at pullouts and walk around the area for better photo ops. I was fascinated by the hieroglyphs on Newspaper Rock. I also loved the rocks in the Petrified Forest - beautiful colors. I would go back in a heartbeat!","July 30, 2014",Exactly as I pictured it,26,"Fairbanks, Alaska",5

We especially enjoyed the Blue Mesa area. It was troubling to read about how the petrified wood was systematically taken over the years by visitors.

Painted Desert,"Our family was close to our final destination in Pinetop, Arizona when we decided to take time to drive through the painted desert and petrified forest for fear we wouldn't have time on our return trip home to Kansas. It was around noon on a hot day in July. We hoped to grab some lunch in the cafe to revive ourselves for the journey, however they had very minimal options except greasy spoon fare. So if you are looking for healthy choices, be sure to stop beforehand. I am sure the Painted Desert is beautiful at the right time of day, but mid-day it was all washed out and not as spectacular as I had seen in photos. The museum is interesting with pretty views from the back veranda. My family was underwhelmed by the petrified forest- so it is important you read the guide the park service provides so you can manage expectations. Also note that restroom facilities are limited - not all locations on the map were open.

There is a vistor's center to first visit so you understand what you will see and you take the short drive around the auto trail drive. This is a painters dream of colors as the desert view gives up a palette of colors that constanly change as the sun shifts through the day.

Painted Desert,"I'm separating the Petrified Forest into two parts, the Painted Desert and the rest. The Painted Desert, a beautiful, pristine piece of colorful, preserved natural history, is the best part of the Petrified Forest, and a reason to come on its own. This is basically a desert scene (sandstone, I'm assuming, much like the areas to the North of the Grand Canyon), cut through various wetter ages and sand-blasted since the area became dry. It's called the painted desert because you'll sit and stare at it for hours and not be sure if what you're looking at is real. The colors, the different layers, and the changes with even a slight shift of the sun, it's just beautiful.I highly suggest getting out of your car, putting on some old sneakers, and walking for a while.","July 14, 2014",Best Part of Petrified Forest,148,"Port Matilda, Pennsylvania",5

Painted Desert,"This review is for both the Painted desert and petrified forest. We started our journey on 180 just west of Winslow. We then turned north on 99 towards the reservations and Indian Rte 2. We proceeded north to 264 where we turned east through the Hopi Indian Reservation and finally south on 77 towards Holbrook where we picked up 40 east towards the park. The initial reason for this route was due to following the Gps navigation to the 'Painted Desert'. While you will be in the Painted Desert the entire trip, the views are not as magnificient as those found in the Petrified Forest National Park. However, if you have extra time and find yourself taking this route, be sure to stop at the corner of 77 and Indian route 15/N 153 for some authentic Indian Tamales!!! They were amazing! The lady sales them out of her vehicle and is very nice. Special note... these are about 4 times the size of the mexican tamales we were used to!Upon arrival at the park, we took the northern entrance and headed south. Words cannot describe the beauty found here! Going this route will take you through the best parts of the painted desert first and then down to the petrified forest. Here, you will encounter the most beautiful displays of petrified wood we have seen. There are park rangers available to provide you with assistance and answer any questions you may have.If you'd rather skip the painted desert, you could head south on 180 out of Holbrook and enter through the south gate. Special note 2... COMING FROM THE WEST, DO NOT TAKE HISTORIC ROUTE 66 TOWARDS ADAMANA RD. AS IT DEAD-ENDS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PASTURE... :)Special note 3...

There are stops where you can get out of your car, walk a few feet, and see the painted desert. It is beautiful. I would suggest going in the middle of the day. This may sound ridiculous, but hear me out. A lot of the colors are accented by the the sun. In the morning and late evening the sun causes a glare that takes away the color. Having the sun directly overhead really accents the colors. Trust me.","July 5, 2014",It doesn't even look real,27,"Joplin, Missouri",5

We were not disappointed with the drive or the views. The Painted Desert seemed to change colors before our eyes as the clouds and the sun moved and the Petrified Forest was fascinating. We stopped at several points along the way and enjoyed the landscape and let the kids out of the car for a bit. The restrooms at three of the parking spots were out of order, so that presented a challenge, otherwise, I would have given an excellent rating. I'm sure they have been attended to by now. It was a very interesting 2 hour drive through the park. As I said, we took a leisurely drive through and I think it could easily be done in an hour. We were able to stop at the gift shop near the end of the road to use the facilities and pick up a couple post cards and a cute little planter with cactus from Arizona.

Painted Desert,"We went to see Petrified Forest National Park. But when you start off from I40/Route 66 going through the loop (named Park Road North of I40 and Petrified Forest Road South of I40) - you will get these beautiful views of areas with eroded rock and gravel ridges coloured in red, brown, yellow, orange, white, black, grey, green... almost any colour except blue. But the sky is blue - so there you go - the whole rainbow of colours. Absolutely recommended! Following the Petrified Forest Road from North to South - you get to see the Painted Desert, and a small memorial where the remnants of an old rusty veteran car is placed close to the road - and some information boards telling about the Old Route 66 that once went there. It it really hard to see where the road once was.But the Painted Desert is not hard to spot! And as always when it comes to colours - early morning or late evening gives you the best colours for your pictures. Unfortunately that does not comply with the opening hours of the Petrified Forest National Park. (I will describe Petrified Forest National Park in a separat review.)Eventually you will leave the park in the South end - getting on to the 180.Actually the petrified wood and trunks you get to see more and more of as you drive south through the park has all once been buried in the same type of rock and gravel as the Painted Desert is all about. It's just the colours of the ""stuff"" that changes throughout layers and areas.So you might say that Painted Desert is actually not a separat area - but more like a feature throughout most of Petrified National Park itself (though some areas are more beautiful than others of cause). These layers of differently coloured stone (heavily eroded) got their colours due to the presence of different minerals and metals. When we rafted Colorado river a week or so earlier - Our guide told us that Little Colorado River got its water-colour (semi transparent milky bluish/white) from underground rivers running below the Painted Desert). Pretty cool!The colors are truly awesome, and similar to those found in parts of The Valley of Fire State Park - North east of Las Vegas. The latter one beeing the best (in my opinion) - when it comes to colours and shapes!But the Painted Desert you actually get as a ""bonus"" on your way to see the petrified wood (if you go from north to south) - and isn't that a treat?!If you want to see some more images than the ones enclosed this review, I have an album here:https://www.flickr.com/photos/by_geir/sets/72157645012521250/","June 29, 2014",Painted Desert - Fitting name for a beautiful area,16,"Oslo, Norway",4

Painted Desert,"My first experience with petrified wood was as a young girl. On a family trip we stopped at the Gingko Petrified Forest State Park. I was smitten. Since then, any time we are near a petrified wood attraction I have to stop. We had been to this Arizona park before, and since we were traveling from Flagstaff to Pinetop I added it to our itinerary. Because of our route we entered at the north entrance (exit 311 on I-40) and exited at the south entrance. This way we drove the entire 28 miles, encompassing the Painted Desert AND the Petrified Forest. While the Painted Desert is interesting, it was not what I really wanted to see. Next time I would enter at the south entrance, drive 5 miles or so into the park so I could see all the best petrified wood stops, then turn around and exit again. I would also go when it was cooler, so we could take our time and explore all the trails that wander through the petrified wood. This time we stopped at one of the shops just outside the park and I bought two pieces of petrified wood to bring home, on unpolished and one polished.","June 24, 2014",I love petrified wood,139,"Surprise, Arizona",5
Painted Desert,"The place has improved since my last visit 10 yrs ago. This part of the park sports a very nice visitors center, a museum, a gift shop, gas station and cafeteria.

No cost to us since we have a Senior Pass.I'm so glad that we stopped to view this area of Arizona. The colors were amazing and enjoyable for the eyes. The turn outs were plenty and very scenic.

Painted Desert,"This was a last minute stop for us on our drive from Santa Fe to Prescott. We entered the Petrified Forest from the WB I-40 and got our passport stamped at the Painted Desert visitor center. We got in for free using our senior pass and drove directly into the Painted Desert. It was a hot sunny day and the colors were beautiful. We saw a nice looking hiking trail at the Painted Desert Inn lookout and wished we had more time here. The desert scenery is beautiful, but a hike would have enabled us to perhaps view vegetation and some animals. We continued driving to the exit, stopping at the Crystal Forest and Route 66 marker (not done well at all) and to take photos of the stunning badlands features like the Teepees. Would love to come back for some hiking and ranger-led tours. We exited on route 180 and drove about 20 miles to Holbrook to get back on the I-40.","June 16, 2014","Great drive, not enough time",79,"Buffalo, NY",4

Painted Desert,"The Painted Desert provides a striking landscape that is both colorful and peaceful. It is not wholly encompassed by the Petrified Forest National Park, but great views may be enjoyed while driving through the park. We entered the Petrified Forest at the south entrance and drove the park road north to the I-40 entrance. As we drove, we noticed the changing landscape – from scattered petrified logs to colorful mounds and hillsides. We enjoyed the beautiful landscape from several pullouts as well as from Painted Desert Inn.

Painted Desert,"The park is very easy to find, right off HWY 40W. I thought we had seen every kind of rock formation and color of rock until we saw the Painted Desert. The sun was out and the colors just stood out all the more. This is not an area you want to hurry through. There are many pull offs where you can get out of your car and marvel at what you are looking at. You can see forever into the distance, and the peacefulness and quiet is amazing. The Painted Desert reminded me a lot of the Badlands, but the reds and blues of the rock formations were more pronounced here. The Petrified Forest is not a ""forest"" at all, but rather pieces of trees that have been cut and are laying all round. Who would have ever thought dead trees could be so beautiful. The colors are magnificent. A reminder for those of you who like to pick up little mementos of your visit....the Ranger will ask if you plan on picking anything up while driving through the park because it is all protected and there is a sign when you are leaving saying stop at the Ranger post because they will check your car. I don't know if they would or not because we were just waved through, but the fine I believe is $300. I would allow at least two hours if you plan on just driving through the park, naturally more if you plan on hiking. It's a beautiful place to visit so don't miss it.","June 2, 2014","Unusual, Beautiful and Worth The Stop",117,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

Painted Desert,"If you are passing through, do it! It is about a 30 minute detour off I-40 and is really pretty at sunset. If you are thinking about a side trip from Flagstaff or the Grand Canyon, think twice. Not really worth the long drive out there for my family, which included a 9 and 6 year old. The jr ranger program is pretty simple, they did earn that so that was fun but otherwise they were bored. We could no go at sunset as it was summer and that would have been 8pm, plus there were major thunderstorms in the area so the sky was black. This seems best suited for someone already passing through, at the right hour of day so the beautiful bright colors appear. There was apparently a restaurant there but it had closed already. There is a gas station but holy cow it was expensive.","May 27, 2014",Not worth a special trip,50,"Phoenix, Arizona",3
Painted Desert,"We visited the Petrified forest as a planned stop on our AZ to CO road trip. We gave ourselves about 4 hours but it took about 7. It is very beautiful. If you start at the north entrance you can see the painted desert, the south end is more desolate but has loads of things to see and it beautiful in it's own way. You have 28 miles of scenery, plus hiking trails and various scenic loops. May is a good time to visit because there are few tourists and you can get through the park easily. A ranger told me that in June and through the summer it would be bumper to bumper RVs. Great place to see. Make sure you don't touch or take anything in the park, if you take any petrified wood the fine is $350 an ounce + possible prison time, we asked a ranger.","May 27, 2014",Worth The Time,100,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

It was a partially cloudy day, which made for beautiful skies and ever changing colorations in the painted desert. One moment the colors would look one way and then out came the sun and they had a whole different tone. We came through in the middle of the week, so there were very few visitors.

As a photographer I enjoy the taking photos of the various desert colors especial during the morning and afternoon hours when the colors seem most vibrant. While there is a temptation to quickly drive thru the area especially in mid day, doing so would be a mistake. The subtleties of changing colors is something you need to behold and if you take the time to enjoy the vistas you will return time and time again. If you take the time and drive slowly thru the park you will be as awe struck as I always am - the beauty of the landscape is beyond belief and well worth the time it takes to visit.

We entered the Park via Route 180 and traveled the approximate 26 miles north to I-40 before returning via Routes 60/77 south toward Show Low, AZ. The petrified forest is an amazing experience of the chemical reaction that takes place turning wood into stone. There is a slab of petrified wood in the Rainbow Musem that explains it took about 10 hours to cut through the stone. In comparison it would have take about 2-1/2 hours to cut through the same size granite. There is a walkway available for those who want to venture out to see many many beautiful examples of petrified wood. It is only about a half mile.

Painted Desert,"As you drive towards the southern entrance you pass two retailers selling petrified wood. It really seemed sad. A limited resource being sold from under the park service. But when I asked about it I was told that is a good thing. Only 10-15% of the area is under park protection, and having retailers help keep theft from the park down. Then you enter the park. I expected to see a few trees here and a few more there. They were everything. Virtually piled upon each other. The little loop behind the visitor center is a good place to start. From that parking lot you can do the long tree loop with the agate house. Massive trees, full length, all over the place. Really fascinating.The ""painted"" part was cool, too. Did one of the walks into the painted desert and the placards along the way did a good job of explaining the geology of what you see. A bit of huffing and puffing on the return loop, it was well worth the effort.","May 12, 2014",Fascinating!,94,CHAPIN,5

But what we saw were beautiful mountains and hills in the most amazing colors. We drove the 28 mile road from the painted desert to the petrified forest. I have some great pictures of petrified wood and the mountain peaks. As you travel through, you will come upon the original Route 66, with a genuine ole jalopy greeting you. They still have the telephone poles up that adorned the route. Also you can visit the Painted Desert Inn with all the original booths and menus. There are many trails that you can walk on to view the petrified wood, but the winds were so fierce that day that we limited our walks to just a few minutes.

Painted Desert,This is a great National Park. The landscape feels other worldly and the history evident in the petrified forest and layers of rock are incomprehensible. We entered through the south entrance (coming from the west on I-40). I'd recommend stopping at the Petrified Forest museum to get a full grasp of the history behind the petrified wood if you come in from that direction. We took the 1 mile hiking path at the Blue Mesa - I would highly recommend it. There is a steep slope for a short distance but the 65+ year old with us didn't have any trouble with it. It was very cool to be able to walk through the badlands. Check the weather before you go!

Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest is in Arizona just off the i40 on a side road leading off from Holbrook. The first fossil/petrified rock shop/gallery is huge and has some amazing fossils on show as well as lots of polished petrified wood made into whatever their imagination could come up with. The wind from the previous day had reduced a lot and if you found a protected spot in the sun, it was quite warm. My Allstays app showed that the campground was in the southern section of the park. Just before the entrance there are two shops selling polished petrified rocks and other nick knacks. One of them told us that camping was $10.75 a night on both sides of the road, while the other one said it was free but there were no facilities. The actual sites were on the “free” side and it was probably once a thriving business with shelters and tables on concrete pads. The electrical outlets were now non functional but we don’t need power all the time.Unfortunately, the park is only open from 7am to 7pm, outside the hours of sunrise and sunset, and the rangers enforce it. Once in the park, the Giant Logs surround the visitor centre where you can also see a documentary on the park. The area dates back to before the dinosaurs and the area has many fossils. The water is undrinkable because it contains sodium and iron, just some of the right ingredients to preserve fossils and petrify the wood. Before the area became a national park people took thousands of the petrified trees by the wagon load. The first afternoon we explored the area around the visitor centre, the Crystal Forest where we saw a green lizard sunning itself on a piece of petrified wood. There is a good walking trail that takes you around many examples of the petrified trees which are all laying on the ground and look like someone has come in with a chainsaw and cut them all up. Incidentally, I’m yet to see a real tree in the park. Next stop is the Jasper Forest which apparently had a huge collection of the petrified wood but it has been mostly removed. The Agate Bridge is a petrified log with the soil underneath having been washing away. They reinforced it in the 1920’s with concrete underneath to stop it from breaking; these days they would just let it fall. Our last stop was the Blue Mesa, and area of badlands which is silted soil that they likened to an elephants skin. We had been warned that the walk into this area had a steep entrance and he wasn’t kidding, a few people didn’t even try walking down but I’m glad we did.The woman at the shop had reminded us that there was a moon eclipse, the blood moon that night at 10:30pm. After checking the time on Google, Lindsay set the alarm for 12:30am as it was due at 12:45am, she was only a few hours out. I had no intention of getting up as I knew it would be freezing! He got some good shots, they aren’t sharp, but you get the idea of what it looks like.On our second day, we ventured further into the park, visiting The Tepes (cone shaped formations with layers of iron, carbon and manganese), Newspaper Rock (petroglyphs) and an ancient village of the Pueblo at Puerco Pueblo, then up to the Painted Desert section of the park and the Painted Desert Inn. Well worth coming to.","April 22, 2014",Worth a visit,34,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest National Park is utterly amazing. Every step you take changes the view and it's hard to tell which part is more breathtaking. We spent about six hours there and I'm sure we didn't see everything, that would take a couple of days. My wife shot 1680 photos. Thank heaven for digital cameras.First you go through the Painted Desert. Stop at the visitor center and see a very friendly and informative gentleman named Guy Van Bloem. He will see that you get a map and show you which stopping points have the best scenery although all of it is fantastic.Once you get to the Old Route 66 stop you can take your photos on a concrete bench with an old Cadillac grill mounted on it. The unstrung telephone poles show the path of the old route.Then it's across I-40 to the Petrified Forest where you will see thousands of pieces of petrified wood that are absolutely stupendous, but don't take any home with you as it is highly illegal and not very nice. There are plenty of places nearby where you can buy petrified wood legally. Don't miss the Agate Bridge which is a one piece log of petrified wood crossing a gulley. In recent years it has been reinforced to keep it in one piece.You'll finish up at the museum where you can walk the path through gigantic pieces of petrified wood and if you see one you think has pretty colors in it, pour some water on it and see how it brings the colors out.I could go on forever but I'll stop and let you go see for yourself.

Painted Desert,"We entered from the South entrance which is not the main entrance, and maybe that's why the park had to creep up on us. At first, it was a little unimpressive. Yes, there was petrified wood. Loads and loads of petrified wood. The most vast amount and largest chunks of petrified wood I've ever seen, but after you've seen one extremely large tree of petrified wood, it feels like you've seen it all.But we kept driving and slowly the desert badlands and then the pueblo ruins and then the painted desert crept up on us and pretty soon we could not believe we were initially unimpressed.The blue mesa trail is not to be missed. This is an otherworldly landscape that we didn't expect at all. Crazy. Also, newspaper rock (bring binoculars. They have binoculars there, but you can generally see better with your own) for a very large collection of petroglyphs. Puerco Pueblo is very interesting... a large base of a pueblo ruin and a solstice rock which is very cool. And of course, the amazing colors of the painted desert near the north entrance. Definitely the most desolate national park I've been to and maybe under-appreciated, but in the end, very cool.","April 1, 2014",Alien landscape,231,"Madison, WI",4
Painted Desert,"We added this to our week long trip in Arizona. The Petrified Forest and Painted Desert are in the same area. It is beautiful. Stop at the Visitors Center at the south end. There is a short movie which explains how the Petrified Forest came about. There is a book of letters from people who have returned pieces of wood that they stole from the park, claiming that it brought them bad luck. It is very interesting to read through. You should allow at least two hours to drive thru the park. There are many vistas and oerlooks to stop at. Breathtaking !

Painted Desert,"This is one of the most understated parks we visited this March. However, for people who like short hikes into the scenery, it is fabulous and requires very little effort. The drives through the park were a bit long, but sometimes you turn a corner and a spectacular view presents itself. The best views are close to the Painted Forest visitor centre in the north end of the park, but the chance to view petrified logs in the southern stretch should not be missed. Count on spending no more than three hours in the park, as the hikes do not occupy a lot of time.","March 31, 2014",great short hikes and lots of spectacular scenery,12,"Guelph, Canada",5

Painted Desert,"I'm a huge fan of all the National Parks so its hard not to rank them all very high. The Painted Desert is just a small portion of the final leg (or first leg, depending where you start) of the Petrified Forest National Park. However it is well marked with some beautiful outlooks and is a wonderful part of our natural wonders. Both the Painted Desert and the Petrified Forest National Parks are fantastic.","March 26, 2014",Beautiful Part of Petrified Forest NP,86,"Franklin, Indiana",4
Painted Desert,Wanted to see the Petrified Forest and had to drive through the Painted Desert to get to it. It was breathtaking. I believed I would enjoy this portion of it but it really blew me away. We thought this stop would last 1-2 hours but enjoyed it so much we spent almost 6 hours in the park.

Painted Desert,"We went to the park after Grand Canyon and it was still incredible. It's astounding that there are all of these trees turned rock and the beautiful colors. This is not just a drive through spot. You need to spend some time here to truly appreciate it. Get out and walk around, touch things and really look. The people who claim it is underwhelming scare me because it means you have been made numb by our fast paced society. How can you not look at this and see how incredible it is. Consider that this particular phenomena has not occurred for millions of years. The trifecta of ingredients required to create the landscape before you is incredibly rare. It is definitely worth a stop. We went too early for the Painted Desert (March) so we missed out on that. Just another reason to go back. $25 park entrance fee. Pets are welcome on leash.

Painted Desert,"We started our trip on the south end of the park where most of the petrified trees are. It's a good idea to stop at the visitor center and view the 20 minute video along with other park displays. The petrified wood comes in an amazing array of colors. And the backdrop for all those old trees is the Painted Desert. Just beautiful colors and so many interesting shapes and features. We didn't have a lot of time, and since we had been here before, we only got out at about half of the stopping points. But we did drive into each of them and just looked from the car at the spots we did not get out. We did spend some time at the old Painted Desert Inn and that was really enjoyable. That must have been a rocking place at one time along old Route 66. The friendly ranger at the inn shared a lot of interesting info and we appreciated seeing the weaving process of an elderly Navajo woman. We also thought the petroglyphs in the park were worth seeing.The trip is 28 miles from one end of the park to the other. Only problem we encountered is the access ramp to I-40 going east is blocked due to construction so we were forced to drive west on I-40 for about 8 miles before we could cross over and head back east. Other than that, all was good.","March 5, 2014",Beautiful colors and shapes,82,Nebraska,4
Painted Desert,"We took the time to visit the two conjoined National Parks in a long day of driving to south Arizona. It was our first visit in 30 years. The colors of the painted desert are just as stunning. We stopped at the visitor center to stamp our passport, and also went into the restaurant/gift shop. The prices for the polished pieces of petrified wood were the lowest of any we saw at the off-park places on the south exit. Buy here...there are posted signs reminding you that no pieces of petrified wood are to be removed. The exit has a vehicle inspection stop in case you get tempted. The large logs of petrified wood on the surface of the park are spectacular. The wood is fossilized, and the color variations are spectacular. Take lots of photos.","March 3, 2014",A perfect slow down on a driving vacation.,19,Missouri Ozarks,5

Painted Desert,"This is just a geological wonder. We pulled off the road enroute to Sedona as a lark, and then wound up spending about 3 hours going through the driving and walking paths. It is an amazing and totally natural wonder. Could not have been mort than 10 cars in the entire 10 mile drive. Most of the time we were by ourselves. Just awesome.

Painted Desert,"We were told not to visit this park because it was terrible with young children. I found just the opposite! My children loved spotting the petroglyphs, seeing the levels of rock in the canyons, and going through the Jr Ranger Club book. Once done, they enjoyed repeating the oath and having an honorary Jr Ranger badge pinned on. It was quite a bit of driving, but we took it as a learning opportunity and supplemented their school, adding this as history, geography and science. THEY ATE IT UP!!This is worth the trip!!","February 24, 2014",Wonderful trip!!!,30,"Clovis, New Mexico",4
Painted Desert,"We spent about 4 hours between Painted Desert and Petrified Forest but you can go at your own pace.. We entered from I-40 North side. Detour takes you to an extra exit and you back track. There are many pull-over stops - each one with a little different view. The old rusted truck near the ole route 66 was a pleasant surprise my husband loved. It amazed me how varied the scenery was. From purple to reds to various shades in between both colors and rock formations varied.The multiple visitor centers were very helpful - recommend stopping at each one. In the Petrified Forest we stopped at every pull-over, loop and walked when there were paths. Highly recommend going.","February 20, 2014",Loved it!

Painted Desert,"I visited this national park with two friends the day after seeing the Grand Canyon. Some people on here warned that it could be a bit of a letdown to come here right after taking in something as spectacular as the canyon, but we didn't feel that way at all. It's definitely a different experience but so cool in its own right.One piece of advice at the onset: make sure to pack food and water! The park is in the middle of nowhere, and there aren't places to buy refreshments aside from the two entrances. We were there in the low season, so the restaurant at the south entrance was closed. We got to the park at about 10:30 and didn't leave until close to 5 and had to subsist on chips and trail mix from the gift shop during that time. There are lots of great picnic spots, though, so pack a lunch!Anyhow, the park is great. It's built around a 28-mile road that goes from the south entrance up to the north (or vice versa). Along the way there are lots of lookout points and trails (never longer than a mile or so), and we did them all. What's nice about the park is that just when you start to feel like you've seen enough of a particular feature, the landscape changes drastically. We started at the south, which is where most of the petrified wood is located. After hiking through a few trails that were surrounded by tons of the wood, we got to the badlands, which felt like being on mars. Definitely do the ""moderate to difficult"" trail through the badlands--it's really not that bad, just a bit steep at the end, and it's an amazing, otherworldly experience.After we'd had our fill of the badlands, we were treated to a couple of stops where we could see some really well preserved petroglyphs...and then, after 5+ hours at the park, right when we felt we'd had enough, we hit the painted desert, which is otherworldly in a completely different way from the badlands. Throw in a bit of more recent history--crossing over Route 66 and checking out a lodge restored by the WPA in the 30s--and it was an incredibly pleasant, well rounded experience.You could easily do the park in a day--it took us about 6 hours--but even if you don't have that much time, definitely spend a while there to take in the highlights. We were glad that we did!","February 9, 2014",Definitely Worth Exploring!,17,"New York City, New York",5
Painted Desert,"The Painted Desert Visitor Center was nice; the gift shop had a friendly and helpful staff. The restrooms were clean. The park has a small and pricey convenient store/gas station that is located right before the Painted Desert entrance. If you love cruising and nature, then you will love the park’s 28 mile paved road with its points that showcase nature’s masterpieces. My family and I enjoyed stopping at every point and loved loitering on a section of Historic Route 66. Afterwards, we continued our cruise, crossed the bridge over I-40 and entered Petrified Forest. We saw The Tepees and petrified logs as we cruised in awe. We drove to the Rainbow Forest Museum. When we arrived the museum was closed, however the short trail behind the museum was great. It was an easy walk that led us to giant logs (about 5ft in diameter). We drove back towards Painted Desert and stopped at Agate Bridge. This natural bridge, that was formed by a petrified log, became my favorite stop. Newspaper Rock was impressive too, with its petroglyphs (the view point has free scopes to view the petroglyphs). Every stop/overlook/point will wow you.","January 30, 2014","If you love nature and cruising, this is a must!",22,"Austin, Texas",5
Painted Desert,"We didn't know anything about this place, it was marked on our map and we thought 'let's have a look'. What an incredible sight this place offers. It is unbelievable, as though transported back to when the dinosaurs lived on earth. The landscape in front of you is painted in colours of red, brown, beige, and it stretches for miles and miles. Easy to drive around, beautiful shop, and most of all a memory for a lifetime.","January 15, 2014",Do not miss this place,17,Berkshire,5
Painted Desert,"We started at the Painted Desert side of the park north of I-40. This is a good starting point and is where the signage off the interstate will take you. NOTE: when driving eastbound on I-40 you must drive beyond the exit normally used to enter the park. You will drive to the next exit, turn left and then take I-40 westbound - this is due to construction work on the overpass normally used by eastbound traffic. Check for updates on NPS website.Here is my best tip for those with limited time and are looking for pretty colors and some petrified wood - take a walk down into the valley directly below the Painted Desert Inn. We looked around the Visitors Center for 20 minutes and then took the short drive to the old Inn for a walk down into the eroded landscape. We did this after I prompted my large, family party to get off the asphalt. I do this wherever we visit, whether it's for 10 minutes or a few hours. The driving tour is good and will allow all but the most mobility challenged to see things easily. That said, the walk down is easy for most and will lead you down a trail where you will come up close to some colored earth and sandstone formations while also finding petrified wood lying here and there. This little walk (10-15 minutes one way) may have been the highlight of the day for me. The wood is much larger and more prominently displayed on the south side of the park but that is in locations with all the people and signs not to leave the asphalt paths. If I had it to do over again I would walk below the Painted Desert Inn area for 30-45 minutes one way and spend more time on the dirt trails, rather than spending so much time looking at the larger petrified pieces at the Crystal Forest and Giant Logs at the south end of the park.Other side trips are available but I had about 5 hours to spend and that is probably plenty of time for the average person to get a taste of the scenery, the petrified wood and the beautiful colors. Colors are always best when the sun is lower in the sky, so get there in the morning or stay until later in the afternoon/evening if you can.","January 13, 2014","Easy access to sites,worthwhile for an hour or a day",45,"SF, CA",4
Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest National Park includes the Painted Desert. There is a 28 mile road through the park from I-40 to 180. There are visitor centers, lots of pull-outs, and walks to see the sites. We didn't take all the walks but did check out all the overlooks. The petrified wood is pretty but didn't keep my interest very long. We enjoyed the painted desert and all the colors. We were at the Painted Desert Inn as the sun was setting. It was pretty but not striking. You need to see where the hills are and where you will get the sun. Also, they want you in your car by 5pm in the winter - so getting the sunset is challenging. Plan accordingly.","January 5, 2014",Great overlooks,130,"Charlotte, North Carolina",4

Its nice but not great compared to other things to see in Arizonathe main centre of the petrified forest is an ideal place for a walk/hike off the beaten track, it is as everything is in Arizona, in the middle of nowhere, we had a great tour guide (Petrified Jack) who really made it much more interesting for us.

At sunrise or in the early morning you are able to see how vibrantly the sun paints the desert pink and purple. We loved it! If you're going to see the Petrified Forest be warned it's a bit if a drive further than the painted desert, probably at least 30 mins. Also it wasn't that impressive to me at least. If you're a senior (62+) you can get a pass into the park for $10. This will get you and anyone you're with into any national park for FREE after you purchase the first time.

Painted Desert,"We spent a very full day here in December. Could have been nasty weather, but it was a balmy 40 degrees in the afternoon, perfect for hiking and photography.Entered at the Southern station and walked at Long Logs, Agate Pueblo and Giant Logs. in The petrified logs had brighter colors and were more numerous than we could imagine along these two trails. Walking to the restored Pueblo was interesting, but not a highlight for us. We saw a herd of eight Pronghorn Antelope near the Pueblo.The southern, small Visitor Center had friendly staff who offered lots of info with a good assortment of books to buy.The nearby Harvey House gift shop and cafe had a beautiful assortment of polished rocks and Native American art, but the food service was almost barren. Two sandwiches in the back of a refrigerated case, lots of sodas, a few cookies and food bars and lots of ice cream. We were glad we had snacks in our car.Driving north through the Monument, we stopped at Newspaper Rock. Although visitors can not get close, there are three mounted spyglasses so you can see the three large petroglyph slabs and several smaller ones. Our binoculars were also very helpful, especially because we take photographs through the binocs.North of I-40 we stopped at several overlooks to view the badlands with late afternoon sunlight. We liked Whipple the best for sunset photography.The Harvey House at the northern entrance had some very fine displays of CCC restoration, murals and a large petroglyph slab depicting a mountain lion almost three feet long. It was collected by the first Park Ranger, long ago. A yound park Intern was very knowledgable about finding rock art sites and gave us lots of locations for a trip next Spring.The northern Visitor Center did not seem to have as many displays as the southern VC, but perhapsw e missed something","December 29, 2013","Great Photography, Hiking, Beautiful Petrified Trees",94,Tustin CA,5

Painted Desert,"We visited the park in early December, so we had the place, practically to ourselves. We preferred the Painted Desert portion over the Petrified Desert parts, but everything was fantastic. We allotted 2 hours, but 3 would have been better. It's difficult to convey in words the beauty and mystery of this area. Parts looked like moonscape, others like lava flows and others like sand sculpture. It was easy to see where Native American artists got/get their inspiration. Most of the park is a gentle drive, there are a few minor hikes, so bring comfortable walking shoes, but they are all on easy paths. Bring a wide-brimmed hat (especially if you'll be doing a lot of hiking), water, camera, binoculars, sunglasses and sunscreen. This probably isn't really intended for kids, only because I doubt most kids would appreciate the geography, but hey, who knows? Depending on where you are heading, the drive South to Payson is also fantastic or a stop in Winslow.","December 16, 2013",Really incredible,138,"Braga, Portugal",5

I was given a token at the North Visitor Center which allowed me to return to the park where I began my southern journey, stopping at lookout points along the way. The colors and formations of the Painted Desert are stunning; the gleaming colors of the fallen logs in the Petrified Forest are beautiful. The view stretches off to the horizon in all directions; it feels like another world. I spent several hours meandering around; walked a little part of the Blue Mesa Trail and spent some time in the Crystal Forest. Stayed till around 4:30 (park currently closes at 5:00).

You don't need to get out of the car, but the well laid out paths are worth the extra time. Be sure to walk the pueblo and petroglyphs also. It was sprinkling when we were there - it made the petrified wood look so real it was hard to believe it was rock. The gift shop also had some beautiful things with reasonable prices - hat and 2 pairs of earrings walked out with us! You can see most things from the car.

It truly feels otherworldly at times. Favorites were Newspaper Rock (see the ancient drawings), the Teepees, and the Agate Bridge. The bridge over I-40 is being replaced, so coming from the west, we had to drive an extra 8 miles and make a U-turn back. Nothing earth shattering, but inconvenient after an already long drive. The Rangers we met were pleasant and helpful. On a funny note, we were constantly reminded about not taking any samples of the petrified wood from the park, but leaving from the southern end and heading east, you are BOMBARDED with places selling TONS of petrified wood.","November 19, 2013",Don't miss this extraordinary National Park!,27,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

The strangest feeling of almost like time traveling was unbelievable. Idea of seeing trees what were still on out planet 200 millions years ago and you can see, touch, feel it. It put me in some kind outer space for a while :-)I spent all day there ( hiked every single trail, but if you are limited with time do for sure Long Logs and Agate House trail and Blue Mesa trail).

We walked some of the short loops and took photos at most of the overlooks. Don't pick anything up or walk off the paved pathways!! You can buy souvenirs and pieces of petrified wood at the gift shops on either end for very reasonable prices and in many different sizes and colors if you are so inclined.

Painted Desert,"No, this is not a park that is as spectacular as Bryce or Arches. It IS a beautiful park in it's own way however. The Painted Desert and the Petrified Forest are connected together on a paved road with many turn outs with views. Some of the views were so close to the others that we felt it didn't pay to stop but when we did, we were truly amazed at how colorful the desert really was. We were somewhat limited in our out-of-vehicle time as the winds were a sustained 40mph making it difficult to enjoy the views but that was out of anyone's control. The park road crosses over I-40 and there is a spot commemorating Route 66 at that location. Once you cross over the freeway, you enter a very rugged area with views of ruins and petroglyphs. Towards the end, you start seeing the petrified trees. There were many more than I expected and quite the sight to see. There is a gift shop and museum at the very end and trails that you can hike among the petrified trees. You don't have to take the entire road back through to the park to get back to I-40, you can just keep heading south to reach 180 which catches up with I-40 right before Holbrook. Even though we were headed back to Gallup, this was a good way to go and you get to see a bit different scenery going this way instead of back tracking through the park.If there was one downside, it was at the beginning where you pull off of I-40. This is where the visitor's center was located. We walked in and asked a 20-something young lady with red hair if she could recommend some hiking trails for us. She just handed us a park flyer and said everything was in there. ""Where exactly""? My companion asked. The girl just rolled her eyes and pointed to the newspaper and said ""In THERE"". She acted like we were wasting her time. We noticed a seasoned citizen lady volunteer that seemed much more friendly and much more knowledgeable so we left the royal pain and walked over to her. She recommended not only trails but sights you would normally drive past unless you knew about them. We were highly impressed by her professionalism and commend the park for having people like here helping visitors. The red head needs an attitude adjustment. When we left, she was sitting away from the counter checking her emails, ignoring other visitors that had walked in.","November 10, 2013",Worth the stop if you are in the area,261,"Cottage Grove, Minnesota",5
Painted Desert,This park is absolutely beautiful!!! Wish we had longer to stay and the weather would have been better. The day we stopped it was raining off and on. Loved how you could drive through and stop as you wanted to at various look outs and points of interest. Loved the painted desert area. So much color and beauty. I would definitely stop back by if we are ever in the area again and would recommend it to anyone traveling in the area.,"November 6, 2013",Absolutely Beautiful!!,41,"Texarkana, Texas",5

Painted Desert,"The park was ok for something to do once. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.

Painted Desert,"There is no other place in the world like the painted desert, and petrified forest. Yes, you drive and stop, and drive and stop. There is no Restaurant or Hotel in the park, and yes, it does get very hot up there in the summer. Next town is Holbrook and if someone wishes to be standing on a Corner in Winslow, Arizona, it is not far.The colors are the best in the early morning or late afternoon. It is a long way from anywhere along I-40, and may not be accessible at some time in winter months.To me, it is worth the effort to go see this place. It is a wake up call to see nature like this, and we all have to realize, how big we humans really are.","November 1, 2013",Painted Desert,19,"Goodyear, Arizona",5

Painted Desert,"Because we have our Senior passes to the National Parks and were passing by the Painted Desert/ Petrified Forest, we decided to make a quick visit. We didn't really give this park its due as we spent very little time and mostly in the car--not the best was to see a National Park.Yes, it's beautiful, but after visits to Arches and Death Valley on the same trip, it paled a little. I wouldn't take the time to return--although we saw very little on our speed-visit. Although the scenery is beautiful, once you've seen it, you've seen it. Maybe great for hiking, but we didn't have time. As always, the park rangers are great hosts.","October 27, 2013",A quick visit only,129,"Saint Louis, Missouri",3

Easy to get around with plenty of restrooms en route. Make sure that you take plenty of water to drink as it can get very dry and arid. The only downside would be the amount of noise from the motorbikes, which call at the site during their route 66 journey.

We have a family with 3 children from preteen to a senior in high school; they were amazed at the scenery and didn’t get bored. We are camera people and loved all the picture opportunities! Get a National Park Pass and SAVE a ton on National parks. We toured from Painted Dessert, Grand Canon, Bryce, Arches, Zion, and Yosemite and saved $ with the park pass. Its good a year so I am sure we will use it at our local National parks as well and save more. 2-3 hours is good but you could spend a lot more time if you wanted to stop at every stop and spend time reading everything.","October 11, 2013",Wonderful place to take pictures,32,Ohio,5

Painted Desert,"A stellar experience, especially when the natural light is good, highlighting rock formation striations along mesas that go on and on. A solitary, two lane-style drive (tank up when you can) out in a vast expanse. Some great places for off-roading, scampering on rocks (in waffle soled shoes) and setting up your easel or drawing pad and charcoals. Fabulous weather formation skies and vistas of badlands across the Four Corners area, from Grand Canyon National Park to Petrified Forest National Park. Desert winds, starry skies.

Painted Desert,This was a breath-taking experience. The Desert is an area that stretches from the Grand Canyon National Park to the Petrified Forest National Park (both of which we also visited).

There are plenty of facilities for travelers and the staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.,"October 10, 2013",Painted Desert (Arizona),41,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

Painted Desert,"this was a truly awesome experience. We started at the visitors center and picked up a map and took a self guided tour, there is an approximate 20 mile loop that takes you to all the best vista points and short hikes to take. First up was the painted desert, it was stunning views ranging from golden to redish purple. it was breathtaking, and then we moved along and saw some petroglyphs etched into the rock from the observatory it was soo cool, i had learned about these in school but had never seen any in real life and they were so easy to see and clear even though they were hundreds of years old. We hiked the blue mesa scenic loop which was unlike any scenery i had ever seen before. This gem in Arizona is truly unique. And our last few stops were of the petrified forest. The logs are incredible, first along the way the pieces that you can see arent all that prominent and then all of a sudden you come to spot tha that has full tree trunks and sections of trees that are undeniable. The petrified logs were absoutley stunning especially with the sunlight reflecting off their every color of the rainbow. This is one of my favorite State park experiences to date. I would highly recommend a trip for everyone! especially those with school age children, its truly a marvel. and all for only the 10 dollar admission per person.","October 9, 2013",BEAUTIFUL,63,,5

Good facilities, enjoy the fresh spring water from the water fountain, nectar on a hot day. Fabulous colours on the polished Stone which was previously logs, we learned a great deal, you can also shop and buy souvenirs. You then have the opportunity to drive through parts of the magnificent painted dessert with the ever changing colours, took soooo many photos, turned out great but would have liked a panaramic one though, if you are nearby don't miss out.","October 9, 2013",A small fee for an amazing day,58,"Ibstock, United Kingdom",5

At the end of the ""Blue Mesa scenic loop"" we took the trail for a short hike. It's well worth it! Don't forget to bring lot's of water and a hat. It was really hot there.

It can get quite hot in the summer during the days so definitely bring plenty of cold water and sunscreen! I noticed both evenings that it became windy and cool by sunset, so I would recommend a sweatshirt or jacket in the evening. The pass that we purchased to enter the park was good for several days so we were able to visit the park both the afternoon we arrived and the next day with no problems.

Learning about the process of natures fossils was amazing and actually getting that close up to real petroglyphs and the amazing crystals in the petrified wood was like walking in another world.

We started at Painted Desert and took our time looking at the various formations and colors throughout the park. We then traveled south across the interstate to the Petrified Forest and were taken in by the large tree stumps that covered the area. With many notes advising you not to pick up anything in the park, we closely examined the trees that at first looked like they had been cut perfectly by a giant saw, but on closer examination, you could see where they broke in almost exactly equal pieces. We also took time to view an ancient Indian Village that was during the time of the Anasazi people. Many people played down the area, but we found it very interesting. We also spent time at the museum at the end of the tour and then at a commercial establishment that was selling legal petrified trees and art just outside of Holbrook, Arizona.","September 3, 2013","Wonderful experience viewing the colors in the desert, looking at the amazing petrified trees.",41,"Loveland, Colorado",5

It is easy to imagine a huge body of water was once in this area. Driving through the area, I reflected that where I drove could have been the place where crocodiles roamed. Near-by bones of dinosaur's at a the Park Museum verified this could be an accurate assumption on my part. The Painted Desert is a vast area of layered colors of the beautiful desert floor. It is well worth the trip if in the area. As a side note, it is easy to lose track of ones speed in the vastness of the park. Please be mindful of the speed limit as the park will report and fine those that are not watching their speed.

I'm glad we came.We started at the South Entrance of the Petrified Forest. The Rainbow Forest Museum doubles as a visitor's center. Right behind it is a short Giant Logs trail where you can see a variety of petrified wood up close. We picnicked at the picnic tables just a short way from the Museum.We hit most of the stops spending most of our time at the Crystal Forest and Blue Mesa. We then ventured to the Painted Desert portion of the park. We hit most of the points spending most of our time at Pintado Point and Kachina Points. We then finished up at the Painted Desert Visitor Center. We were in the park about 3.5 hours; we could have spent less time (though not much) and we certainly could have spent more hours there. The petrified wood was amazing the scenes of the Painted Desert were simply beautiful. I'm glad we spent our day there. The wide varieties of colors in the Painted Desert was simply amazing. Tip-the NPS brochure (and web site) tells you how to spend your time if you're short for time; it's spot on. Also you can purchase petrified wood at the Concessionaire shop right next to the Painted Desert Visitor Center.","August 25, 2013",Painted by the Master Painter,160,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Painted Desert,"On our way back home to the West Coast from the 4 corners area we stopped off at the Petrified Forest National Park in New Mexico. Now, I've been to quote ""petrified forest"" parks and attractions in many different parts of the country. In most cases you may see a bump in the ground that they say is a petrified tree stump, or you may see a little fragment of something here or there. In these places the vast majority of he petrified wood you'll see is in the gift shop. So, my expectation was that this park would be somewhat similar. Maybe a few more fragments scattered about as the Park Service may be more diligent in keeping relics from wandering off but I didn't expect much. In fact, I presumed that the most interesting thing would be watching a few trains go under a bridge on the main park road. I also heard that you could see some painted desert here as well, but as earlier in the trip we drove through the area that was shown on the map as ""The Painted Desert"" and, although it was interesting, it was not so fascinating that I pulled over to take some pictures. We entered the park at the North entrance which is right on I-40 - stopped in the visitor center to pick up a T-shirt for our collection and started our drive through the park. This place is amazing. First of all, while still on the North side of I-40 each pull out afforded a view of the Painted Desert that was better than the one before. We stopped at every one. One was near the old ""Painted Desert Inn"" which is no longer an Inn but rather more of a museum. Inside we ran into a ranger who told us the Fascinating story of the place. Then, when he saw we were actually listening and interested, took us around back and unlocked some doors into rooms where some of the ""Harvey Girls"" staff lived while they worked there and told us what it was like for them. Quite fascinating. So, on we went. We got to the park around 9:15 (mid May) so the light was already past it's prime for photography. But the painted desert was so gorgeous with all the striated colors in the rolling landscape I shot photos anyway. Surprisingly, many of them came out OK but I sure do wish I'd been there closer to sunrise or sunset. In this part of the park you are on the top of a mesa, looking down into the landscape that extends off into the distance. The literature says this is the southern end of the painted desert but even so it was pretty spectacular. The main park road crosses over to the south side of I-40, and then over the railroad tracks. I wanted a photo from that bridge of a passing train but as we spent so much time just getting that far, we didn't feel like waiting for a train (which by the way come by around every 15 to 20 minutes). Had one been visible a few miles in the distance we would have stopped and waited for it. Where as the north of I-40 part of the park is billed as the Painted Desert part and the south of I-40 part of the park is billed as being the petrified forest portion, I must say that there was plenty of painted desert on the south side as well. The Petroglyphs turned out to be a dud. You can't get close and they're at a weird angle to where you're standing. They do have a scope to help you see though. But seen much better elsewhere. But all the other turnouts were great. Every turnout had great views of the Painted Desert landscape - each one with different formations and colors - or had tons of petrified logs, or both. We stopped at just about every turn out and took several of the shorter loop trail walks. There were entire logs of petrified wood as well as smaller chunks. By small, I'm guessing over 100 Lbs. each as most all of the ""carry-able"" pieces nearby the trails had been stolen and carted off by tourists. We won't go into my opinion of people who do that sort of thing other than to say it's not high. Not only was there loads of petrified wood to see, much of it had incredible colors and patterns. A real delight to see. I'm attaching some photos of the painted desert and some petrified wood.

Miles before actually reaching the Forest station you can see petrified trees all around, but the biggest are once you get to the Petrified Forest.

Once you drive into the park and pay the entrance fee, you're pretty much committed to the see all of the Painted Desert and the Petrified Forest. If you choose to stop at every pullout vista, get out and walk the trails, the trip could take pretty much half a day. Good thing there is restrooms at some of the stops,, because you are going to need it. Note; that driving through the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest National Park, you will go from a temp in the mid 80's to the low to mid 90's as you get closer to the center of the Petrified Forest.

Painted Desert,"On a recent road trip through the western USA we did a side trip from Flagstaff to see the Petrified Forest. Compared to some of the other National Parks which we saw (Arches, Canyonlands, Grand Canyon, Zion and Bryce Canyon) the Petrified Forest is far less scenic. However, it is spectacular for the vast amount of Petrified wood lying around. Although petrified wood is fairly common in many places the large pieces of trees preserved here is somewhat unique. One can start at the south end (off highway 180) and take the 28 mile drive to the north ending up in The Painted Desert area, or start off Highway 40 and drive south. Some of the most interesting stops were Blue Mesa, Crystal Forest and the Giant Logs. The park is not a destination in which one needs to spend several days, but it is easy to spend a full day examining the badland scenery and the petrified logs. There are also some petroglyphs and Pueblo ruins. Petrified Forest is well worth a visit if you are anywhere in that vicinity.","July 20, 2013",Petrified Forest National Park,158,"Calgary, Canada",5

I expected more forest/petrified logs, but the colors in the desert were amazing. The petrified logs are throughout the park, but you will find most of them in the giant logs section. Heads up, next to the visitor's center is a small gift shop. You can purchase a small container of petrified rocks for $5. These made a great souvenir for the kids. The rocks do not come from the park, but come from private land. Do NOT open them in the park so you are not accused of taking rocks from the park. The warning is on the back of the container and the rangers will tell you the same thing.","July 19, 2013",Absolutely beautiful!,170,"Orlando, Florida",5
Painted Desert,"On our 3rd trip to Sedona, we decided to take one day to see something new: The Petrified Forest National Park and Painted Desert. We are all so glad that we did! In a land of gorgeous landscapes (Grand Canyon, Sedona's Red Rocks and canyon, Flagstaff's mountains and forests, Phoenix's desert) this adds something different and spectacular, and it deepened our appreciation of Arizona diversity. We started at the south entrance of the Petrified Forest National Park and drove north toward the Painted Desert (all within the park.) There is a small museum (Rainbow Forest Museum) at this entrance that is an essential stop. They play a 10 minute movie on a continuous loop that explains what you are about to see, and it is an excellent preview. (The movie can be purchased to take home, with extra footage.) We left the small museum understanding that we were about to learn more than we thought! This museum is also a gift shop with some interesting materials for children and adults. Best to buy them while you are there. I bought some Native American music cd's. There are a few well done displays about dinosaurs and 3 dinosaur skeleton models that held the kids attention for quite a while. We enjoyed the entire park and wished we had more time to spend walking the trails. We felt it was worth the trip even without taking long walks. What we saw at each stop along the drive amazed us: ages 70 something, 40 something, 15 and 5. Entrance to the park was free with the senior pass we had purchased at the Grand Canyon. We just ate snacks in the car when we got hungry to tide us over until lunch, and we brought plenty of water. We stopped to buy ice cream for the kids at the end of the Painted Desert. There is a gift shop and restaurant there. Park opens at 7 am.","July 17, 2013",Well worth the long drive from Sedona!,33,"Jackson, New Jersey",5

They are especially vibrant at dawn and dusk. Pack a picnic lunch and bring something to drink as there are no services close by. The drive through it, and the adjacent petrified forest, is about 28 miles and if nyou stop to take in the sights, which I highly recommend, it will take you about three hours.

Also make sure to wear sunscreen if you plan on looking around outside. The desert sun can burn quickly. My 8 year old even liked looking at all the rocks. ,"July 5, 2013",Absolutely Beautiful!

At one location in the Petrified Forest, you can actually walk down to some of the ""logs"" and get close up pictures - but don't touch them. The Park Rangers ask at the exit to the park if you took anything. Plan to spend several hours here - both parks are connected - and at one spot, you can see where Route 66 actually went through the park. We went off season and this offers you the best chance to take your time and see everything you want to see. While there is a fee for this, you can use a Senior Pass ($10 for lifetime to all National Parks if age 62, includes entry for 2 people) or an Annual Pass, also good for all National Parks.","June 29, 2013",Beautiful - Unbelievable that this exists on earth!,33,"Ipswich, Massachusetts",5

Painted Desert,"Staring out at the Painted Desert sands it is difficult to conceive that 225,000,000 years ago this was a hot, steamy, swampy, equatorial environment. The abundance of petrified wood and crocodilian fossils found in the park are a testiment to that climate. Before entering the park there is there is the Painted Desert Visitor's Center. Ranger's can advise you on how to best use your time. Itineraries are available for 1 hr., several hour, 1/2 day and full day plus stays. Pick-up your guide newspaper which has all the stops listed and all other information you need to know about trails, pets, backcountry camping, etc.. There is a cafe, souvenir shop and restrooms and water station there also. Gas is sold there also but is expensive. Admission for vehicles is $10 for 7 days. All National Park Passes are recognized. There are free days as well. Check them out on the Petrified National Park website.If you can gas up in the town before or after the park it is a lot cheaper. If you are not planning to do any hiking, you can stop 10 minutes at each location and be out of the park in 3 hours. Driving straight through the park is about 45 minutes.The park opens at 7 am. This is when many photographer's take advantage of the light. The hour before sundown is the other. The highlights for me was the painted desert pullouts, Blue Mesa trail, Newspaper rock with it's 650 petroglyphs, the Petrified Forest and the large logs behind the Rainbow Forest Museum.

I would recommend this route rather than the other way around because from north to south, the attractions just get better and better. If you go south to north, you see all the good stuff first and you may get a little bored by the end of the loop. We stopped at virtually every pull off point along the road and it was worth it. The park recommends 2-3 hours to see the whole thing, but we took over 4 hours. Pay attention to the clerks in the gift shops.

From there, it's up to you to explore the endless landscapes and the fascinating rock structures that dot the landscape. At times it feels like you're in the midst of The Lion King, with the stunning panoramic views and the wonderful isolation. Make sure you grab a map so you can scope out each of the landmarks along the way. Another tip, try and time it so you can see the sunset. You won't regret it.

Park tours, guided by knowledgeable, enthusiastic park rangers are available at a reasonable price. Each stop along the driving tour have placards that explain what you are seeing as do various locations on the walking paths. The Rainbow Forest is a very cool experience. Viewing the petroglyphs at Newspaper Rocks takes some time and you need to use the scopes provided at the overlook or you own binoculars or camera lens to see them clearly. With the help of magnification they suddenly pop out as the works of art they are. You can get a closer view at the Puerto Pueblo without the need of magnification.

Painted Desert,"Our timing was excellent, allowing plenty of relaxed wandering at multiple stops along the Petrified Forest drive through the park. We came in from the south, after a 3.5 hour drive from Phoenix. This set up for an end point in the Painted Desert at sunset, just what we hoped. You can just drive along and pit stop at various look-outs, but I highly recommend getting out of the car and exploring several trails. They are generally short and easy walking, but offer lots of close ups of the unusual geology. We tried several and each stop provided different information and scenery. The Giant Log trail at the (south) visitor’s center was a good introduction, and close encounter with the (other) Old Faithful (huge petrified tree). Borrow (or buy) a copy of the very informative brochure to maximize the experience. The Crystal Forest trail offered a wonderful mix of petrified woods and washes. Further up the road, Newspaper Rock was a chance to see petroglyphs in large number and wonderful detail. The spotting scopes do a great job, but bring binoculars if you have them. The teepees are another pretty (brief) stop which are likely even nicer with later in the day lighting to bring out the blues and purples. Our final stop in the Petrified Forest was a small ruins (Puerco Pueblo) with close up petroglyphs, including the Summer Solstice Marker. Moving on we entered the Painted Desert. Oh, to have been here to stay at the Painted Desert Inn in its heyday. The tiny rooms all have amazing views of the desert flora and geology. I imagine waking (in a tiny bed, all that would fit) to look out my window at the scene. It is now an historic site to tour and get refreshments if you get there early enough (which we did not). Our goal…sunset came around 7pm, just in time for photo ops and leaving the park before closing. It was worth the wait, as the golden sun set off the reds and blues, adding shadows and depth, all around us. A final plus, with the May date of this trip…it felt like we had the world to ourselves. Lastly, not sure if this was a fluke of our visit, but just in case, be prepared for strong winds and camera turbulence.","May 25, 2013","Many different, all wonderful experiences in this park",94,"Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania",5

We recommend on starting early since the heat/sun can be intense with little shade along the way.

Painted Desert,"Firstly I have to say that I had originally never intended to go and see the Painted Desert as the name just didn't strike a chord with me. I was originally after the Petrified Forest, but you can't do one without the other. It's all on the same long scenic road. I am now glad to say that the Painted Desert is not to be missed. To look upon the peaks and dunes you can really understand why they call it 'Painted'. The landscape is layered in soft pastels that come together to form giant Tiramisu peaks reaching up out of the creamy desert floor. The desert is big, very big. Don't think for an instant you can drive up, take a peek and think you've seen it all. The Desert stretches all the way from Holbrook, AZ all the way up to the Lake Powell, at the start of the Grand Canyon. It also incorporated Navajo Nation, which during the summer months they observe Daylight Savings time, unlike the rest of Arizona. Remember to take this into account when travelling in the area.

There is an excellent trail through the Crystal Forest which can comfortably be done in 30-40 minutes. The visitor centre also has some excellent specimens on display.

Painted Desert,"This is a decent way to kill an hour winding through the painted desert at 35mph for 28 miles. Nothing bad about any of it, just a leisurely tour with as many or as few stops as you want along the way. You could easily stop every 15 minutes and walk around if you are so inclined. Happy that I went through, but not something that I would see myself returning for.","April 27, 2013","Fun, but nothing especially spectacular",38,"San Francisco, California",3
Painted Desert,"This national park is smaller than most, but still worthwhile seeing. The hikes are short and easy for everyone. The wood/stone is colorful and amazing and the history of how old the petrified wood is blows the mind. Easily visited in one day.

It was a very windy day the first day, with wind 30 - 40 miles per hour and gusts from 55 - 65 miles per hour. Interstate 40 was closed from Winslow to Flagstaff. It was cold the second day, even snowing in Winslow where we were staying.Even with the bad weather, we didn't regret our visit. We loved looking at the petridied wood and took many pictures. We also enjoyed visiting the shops outside the park.

Painted Desert,"We spent two days in the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest. Most of that time, we walked around and stared at what is by far one of the most fascinating places to visit in Arizona. The forest rangers we met there were outstanding guides. The best part was that most people tired of them and left. It may have been the sun. But we hung out with them and were given insights into that landscape we never could have known on our own. That was where we learned about the 3 sisters of food that the original inhabitants depended on--squash, beans, corn. We could be shown how those plants could grow together and protect each other. it's also where we met one of the largest raven populations we have seen and they are also native to the area.","April 20, 2013",Painted Desert is mesmerizing,33,"New York, New York, United States",5

Painted Desert,"The southern entrance is where most of the petrified wood can be found and I would suggest starting at the northern entrance by the painted desert and exiting at the south. The northern end has the gift shop and food, but outside the southern end are 3rd-party museums and gift shops where you can buy your own little chuck of petrified wood that you shouldn't bring INTO The park.","April 16, 2013",A wonderful drive,31,"Harpers Ferry, West Virginia",4

Purchased a ticket and saw part of the Painted desert. Drove back the next day and revisited the Painted desert. It was beautiful, took a lot of pictures. Continued on to the Petrified Forest and were very amazed at the trees and what had happened to them. Spend an enjoyed day at both places.","April 9, 2013",Beautiful Place,2,"Winnipeg, Canada",5
Painted Desert,"I had always wanted to go here since I was a little kid, but was kind of sad after I saw it. The area was home to a vast petrified forest, however, in the 1800s they constructed a railroad to the site and ""harvested"" most of the petrified wood, shipping it in railcars to the east coast. One ranger I spoke with said that less than 10 percent of the original petrified forest remains today. What remains is still very interesting though. Don't forget to stop by the Painted Desert visitor center. It was originally a Harvey House called the Painted Desert Inn, and had a restaurant, lounge, soda fountain and even a few rooms to rent out.","April 8, 2013",Sad proof of a past society's greed and selfishness.,123,"Las Vegas, Nevada",4

Painted Desert,"If you are traveling through eastern Arizona on Interstate 40, you have to pull off at the Petrified Forest National Park / Painted Desert. The Painted Desert is just one part of the National Park. It's the easiest place to make a quick stop and view the incredible desert scenery. The multi-colored rock/ground is what gives it the name the Painted Desert. There are several view points that are within a couple miles of the interstate. If you are heading west and want to see the whole Petrified Forest, you can keep on driving and go out the south end of the park and then head back to Interstate 40 on US 180 for 10 miles or so. You'll see lots of big trunks of petrified trees. It is definitely worth stopping for. If you are heading east, you can get off I-40 on US 180 at Holbrook. You follow 180 for 10 miles to the south entrance of the park and follow the road and you will end up back on I-40. Going either way its a must stop and see. The Painted desert is north of I-40 and the Petrified forest is mostly south of I-40.","April 8, 2013",Worth a stop. It's right off the Interstate,178,"Windsor, Colorado",4
Painted Desert,"My first word of advice - take your time. Give yourself 2 hours for a quick view/drive through the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest, but to really enjoy all these Parks have to offer, allow 4 hours, including lunch. We started at the Rainbow Forest Visitor Center,which is in Petrified Forest and is the smaller of the two visitor centers. We spent some time in the small museum and then walked the Giant Logs Trail adjacent to the museum. Next stop, the Crystal Forest with an easy trail through petrified wood. Drive past the Tepees and then an absolute must stop is Newspaper Rock. The petroglyphs are just amazing. They are so intricate and there are so many. Then just around the corner is Puerco Pueblo where you can walk right by the foundations of a 100 room pueblo built around 1250 where maybe 200 people lived. Then back in the car and off to the Painted Desert about a 15 minute drive. The first stop is Route 66. You will see an old car that marks a portion of Route 66. The Painted Desert is the only National Park to include a portion of Route 66. But the first, take-your-breath-away viewpoint is Lacey Point. Pull off and take the time to really take in the colors. If you are lucky to be there on a partly cloudy day, as we were, or at sunset, the colors are even more vibrant. A stop at the Painted Desert Inn is a joy. And the views, spectacular. We finished up at the Painted Desert Visitor Center, a large center that also includes the only restaurant in either park.Don't rush this day. Slower is really better. You will never see anything like this again, so take the time to enjoy the experience.","April 2, 2013",Take your time - it will be rewarding,283,"Castro Valley, California",5
Painted Desert,"We were headed from Tucson AZ to Monument Valley UT and decided to stop off at the Petrified Forest. We are glad we did. The scenery along the 20 mile plus park road is vast, open and beautiful. We saw parts of the Painted Desert, badlands, and petrified logs that were over 200 million years old. The visitors center is very good. There were hiking opportunities that we didn't have time to do. Scientifically and prehistorically very interesting and educational.","April 2, 2013",The Petrified Forest National Park is a geological treasure,47,Atlanta,4
Painted Desert,"We allotted two hours during our drive through Arizona to stop here. It was very impressive. My kids age 7 & 8 were fascinated and full of questions. The museum was helpful in explaining how the trees turn into stone and then we drove through the park. WHOA! We spent three hours because we enjoyed it so much and could have made a day out of it. My kids are still talking about that as much as the Grand Canyon. The petrified trees littering the park were fascinating. We are so glad we went. Bring water and pack snacks and it will be a nice, long outing with some easy trails.

You drive about 1/2 a mile from the gate, make a turn and you are blown away.We didn't have time to walk on any of the paths, but there were several cars parked with no sign of their occupants, so I assume they were hiking. Since it's within hailing distance from the highway, it seems like everyone with an hour to spare would drive in and enjoy the views.

Painted Desert,"If you are a natural history buff you will love the Petrified Forest. I'd read about this place and the Painted Desert but had no idea how extensive it was. You can almost picture yourself in a forested coastal wetland like southern Louisiana. This Triassic (~225 million years ago) floodplain must have been very impressive at the time. Although you can see logs almost the entire drive through both what is the painted desert badlands and petrified forest, the Crystal Forest is the most impressive area for the petrified wood. Blue Mesa is definately worth the drive and while there you have the opportunity to hike down through the Chinle Formation and see the rocks up close and personal. There is also a substantial amount of wood eroding from the strata. The colors here are extrordinary. My comanion and I were there around 5:30 pm in mid March; about 1.5 hours before the sunset. I think this is the best time to experience this place. Colors are due to various combinations of mineral composition (iron, magnesium carbonate, & organic matter) and paleo-groundwater levels that have leached and redeposited these minerals throughout the sediments. A place I will definately return to. There is a great place to purchase petrified wood outside of the park (Petrified Forest Company). We purchased an annuan park pass for $80; if you are planning to see more than 4 parks this is worth the priceI was absolutely appalled to find out that despite efforts to protect this important paleontologic resource (there are also dino's and remnants of humanity here), close to 12 tons of petrified wood is taken from the park annually. So please purchase it at one of the many gift stores. Usually wood is sold for about $2/lb. We had a coupon for a free 1/2 pound plus if your chosen piece went over that amount they gave it to you for $1/lb. This is already a steal. Protect this resource.","March 22, 2013",Astonishing Place,13,"Phoenix, Arizona",5

The first time we found it by mistake, but this time we went back because we remembered its beauty. Navajo natives also sell their handmade items at roadside stands along this drive. It is amazing at one stop where you can park and get out to go for a really short walk to a beautiful area where the river runs through the bottom of the canyon, and all of the land above the river looks as though it could crumble to pieces at any moment. There are so many colors of pinks, reds, and blues and the way that the land is carved is really unique.","March 16, 2013",Very unique and beautiful,12,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

However, it may depend on the time of day. What may look like just a nice wide desert vista in mid-day turns glorious in the late afternoon sunlight. Do the Petrified Forest also. You'll be amazed at the Petrified Forest....then WOW'ed by the Painted Desert. Takes about an hour to drive through the Painted Desert and to visit the visitor center located there. I could have spent another hour or two just staring at the landscape full of pinks, reds, lavenders, and purples. It's like watching waves at the seashore - the colors move and change with the light.

If you have just 15-30 minutes to spend in the park, this is the part to visit. I felt the vista is similar to the badlands in the Dakotas, but with the added snow it looked serene in the setting sun.

The name ""Painted Desert"" is so fitting as there are literally areas of this desert where it looks like someone just poured paint over the rocks.

After we left there, we drove to the area best known as the Painted Desert. The petrified trees are no longer seen in this area, but the whole landscape takes on the appearance of an artist's palette. The colors of the sand and hills are just stunning. There are many places to pull off and take hikes or just look. The colors change as the day goes by and looks quite different from morning to late afternoon. Another interesting thing in this part of the park are the petroglyphs in the stone. Binoculars are set up at some of the vista points so that you can see them better if you don't want to walk out to them. The history is given on the informative signs at each stop. Very interesting.

It's a great learning place for kids for sure. The place is beautiful, good for photo taking. Keep in mind that the park closed at 5PM and technically no stopping at 5PM.

When you think about how it has taken millions of years for these to form, it is even more spectacular.We hadn't originally planned on spending so much time in Painted Desert, but we ended up driving pretty slowly just to take it all in.

A short video is available in a comfortable auditorium that explains the basics of the petrified forest and how all the logs came to be where they now rest.,"October 29, 2012",Worth and Extended Visit,70,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5
Painted Desert,"My family just got back from a 10k mile trip across the US from New Jersey to Washington State, down the coast to California and then back across the US again home to NJ. Of all of the things that we say on this trip, one of the things that we talk about the most is the Petrified Forest. I think this is for two reasons. One, it was not something that we even had on our agenda for the trip, it is not too far from the Grand Canyon and we decided to check it out. Two it was so awesome that it really surprised and enchanted us. The big surprise isn't that you are going to see some trees that were turned to stone. It is that when they petrified, the insides turned into crystals that are multicolored! It is like the fallen trees turned into semi-precious stones inside! It was so cool to just walk amongst these and look at all of the different patterns and variations in the coloring. It was something that you can reach out with your hand and touch if you wish, just don't take anything. It is tempting because small pieces are everywhere. There are not just one or two trees, but thousands, many even millions I don't know for sure. I would recommend visiting this park if you are in the area. You also get to drive through the Painted Desert as well as an added bonus! National park pass get you full access to the park with no other fees.","October 23, 2012",Much cooler than I ever expected,23,"Millville, NJ",5

Painted Desert,"After the extreme drama of some of the other National Parks in Arizona & Utah, this was a rest to our senses. We visited on a cooler day with clouds & a little warm rain. It was very quiet - we almost had the place to ourselves. It is quite a long easy drive through with most of the petrified wood at one end & most of the painted desert at the other end & lots of interesting stopping off places in between. Our ticket was for a week &, as the light was going when we left, we went back to the painted end the next morning for better photos. We had a warm welcome from the sales assistant in the old lodge who explained its history..","October 20, 2012",Peaceful,246,Hertfordshire,4

Painted Desert,"Travel from the Petrified Forest to Painted Desert this way you can arrange to be there for sunset. We had a very informative talk from the Park Ranger at the Visitor's Centre as we entered the Petrified Forest, this made the stop offs of more interest and we knew what to look out for on route. Allow a day to do both and to get out and walk at the majority of the stop offs and time to take pictures. A very enjoyable day enjoying nature and the wonderful views.","October 16, 2012",Well worth the visit,17,"Farnham, United Kingdom",4

Painted Desert,This is a vass beautiful and colorful desert. Colors range from Pink to yellow to tan and white. Very muted and soft. It is right off I40 so easy to get to. Connected to the drive is the Petrified Forrest which we did not see but pictures make this stop worthwhile. This drive also has Petroglyphs at Newspaper Rock and a ranger to explain the drawings. Also there are Pueblo remains of about 75 rooms surrounding a courtyard from about AD1400. This is a peaceful ride on nice roads. Be sure not to pick up any petrified wood as they do ask and check. Fines are high from our understanding. Nice gift shop.,"September 30, 2012",Beautiful,324,"Smithfield, Virginia",4

Painted Desert,"We ventured to Petrified Forest National Park as one of our ""things to do while in Arizona."" I am so happy that we made the trip! The scenery was gorgeous and the colors of the mounds and petrified wood were radiant. It was certainly amazing staring at the enormous logs and knowing that these took some time to form and were over 200 million years old. I highly recommend stopping at the information center and gift shop. I scored an amazing piece of petrified wood (legally collected from outside the national park) for a great price. DO NOT take any of the ""fossils"" from the national park!

Painted Desert,"To truly absorb what the painted desert and petrified forest have to offer, one has to allow hours and hours, as well as be prepared to stop and read signage. We started at the painted desert end of the park, and availed ourselves of every stopping-place en route. Each stop afforded a different view, different history, and different light for truly uniquer photos. As of the hues of the painted desert weren't enough to satisfy us, when we added the walking tour of Blue Mesa and got up close with petrified trees, we were truly mesmerized. That plus the agate trail reminded us of our miniscule place in time and space. The museum display at the south end of the park helped put a lot of things into perspective. And there were two bonuses: a pueblo ruin and ""newspaper rock"", further reminders that we weren't the only humans to have made stops here.","September 27, 2012",28 miles in 5.5 hours,122,"Belleville, Canada",5

You really couldn't ask for more variety of sights though. We were there mid day, so the colors of the painted desert may have been a bit muted, but each area really was different and neat. Newspaper rock was neat and informative. I really enjoyed the Petrified Forest. To see the changes that a simple tree can make through time is amazing. It is definitely a must see if you are in the area.","September 4, 2012",Beautiful area of many different sights,20,"Washington, MO",4

Painted Desert,"I would caution you against expecting too much. Previous reviews compare it to the Grand Canyon, which may be true in terms of landscape and color. But, obviously, the scope and magnitude of the Grand Canyon far surpass the Painted Desert.That having been said, this is a phenomenal place to spend a day. The desert comes alive with different colors and personas depending on what time of day you are there. If you have time to devote the whole day to this one small area, you will be rewarded with a multitude of pictures and memories. Come expecting beautiful colors and landscapes, and you will be rewarded.If you're the hardy type, you can really have a great experience by coming in late summer during Arizona's monsoon season.

Painted Desert,"We thought we would stop and tour the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert on our way to the Grand Canyon. We are very glad we did. The views from Kachina Point were amazing. It was nice touring the Painted Desert Inn. There were a few exhibits inside that told the history of the Inn and the Park. It looked like someone came long and painted the hills and valleys, just gorgeous!!! We couldn't believe it was done naturally. The drive to the Petrified Forest was nice, lots more amazing outlook points to take pictures. We stopped and took the Puerco Pueblo Trail. The trail was easy to hike and the ranger was informative. We saw remains of the Puebloan Village. Our girls loved the petroglyphs! We visited the Rainbow Forest Museum. Definitely worth a stop and watch the 20 minute video, great information. We walked along the Giant Logs trail. It was a moderate hike. We took quite a few pictures of the giant petrified logs, very colorful and shiny.

Painted Desert,"Took the 28 mile drive through the prehistoric forest and painted desert. You can enter the double National park from either end, we would recommend entering at the Painted Desert end (farther East) on I-40. If coming from the west, don't exit the first time you see the signs...if you do the entrance is about 15 miles off the highway. The exit at the east end is right at the highway and if you are the sort to stop for souvenirs on the way out, those stores are all at the west entrance. If you are fit enough, consider walking down to the desert floor at the old Inn in the painted desert. There are some pieces of petrified wood down there you can inspect closely and keep an eye out for colorful collared lizards and antelope. It's a fascinating perspective down there.

We had not reached the Grand Canyon yet, and this was a wonderful prelude to that grandeur. The fee per car was only $10, and we saw beautiful views, rainbows, the Santa Fe Railway, Indian ruins, rock formations, and petrified wood. There are also many trails, but we did not take time for these since we were trying to get from Amarillo, TX to Williams, AZ in time for dinner. We took photos at TIponi Point and Kachina Point, and drove by several other beautiful vistas. We crossed historic Route 66 and then drove on the park road to the Puerco-Pueblo. We didn't stop and view the hundreds of petroglyphs etched at Newspaper Rock, but we drove by it. We saw the multi-colored ""teepees"" which are layers of minerals in cone shaped formations, and saw teh hundreds of petrified logs in the Jasper Forest. There were several museums, and opportunity for hiking, camping, and picnics, but we were just driving though. Also on the grounds are gift shops, restaurants, gas stations and post office. We saw the buildings, but did not take time to enter. I wish that I had known more about this park before decided to just drive through it. We would have planned to spend more time and to study ahead on what we would be seeing. Cominf from the east on I-40, it is exit 311. We drove south through the park and then took HWY 180 back up to I-40, entering at Holbrook.

It was all pretty and interesting, but the highlight for us was the Blue Mesa Trail in the Painted Desert part of the park. The trail is about a mile long, and goes down into the bottom of the badlands area. The colors are awesome, and although there were a lot of people in other parts of the park, we didn't see very many people on the hike. I had read some reviews that said the trail was steep and difficult, but it wasn't bad. It was a paved trail, and the descent and ascent wound around enough that it wasn't too difficult. It only had a couple places with steep drop-offs, very manageable for me even with my fear of heights. It was hot, so be sure to take water.","July 4, 2012",Blue Mesa Trail,27,"Buffalo, Missouri",4

Painted Desert,"We only had a short time, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much we could see after driving just a short distance from the interstate (something I hadn't been able to ascertain from other reviews). It was VERY hot, but the Visitor Center is well air-conditioned and the rangers there are very helpful. The VC is on the small side, but has some informative displays. There is also a small ""Fred Harvey"" restaurant that we did not visit. The Visitor Center can be visited without paying the park's entrance fee, but once you pay the $10 fee, you can drive along the canyon's rim to several viewpoints. We didn't enter the Painted Desert Inn (a National Historic Landmark), but it was interesting to view from the outside. We passed several viewpoints and picnicked at the Chinle Point viewpoint, which has multiple shaded picnic areas and a restroom. The views from this point are over 180 degrees and gorgeous! We walked out to the rim and got a few pictures before fleeing back to our van's air conditioning. We could see some petrified trees down in the canyon, but didn't do any hiking to see them close-up. That will have to wait for another trip.You can continue around the Loop for 6 miles (measured from the VC) before the park's road crosses over the interstate and continues on toward the northern portion of the park. If you are headed back to I-40 West, turn around at the Route 66 exhibit (complete with classic car photo op), as there's no access to the interstate from this point.

Painted Desert,"Like any of the other National Parks I have been to (and I want to stress Parks here, not historical sites, monuments, etc.), Painted Desert/ Petrified Forest is laid out in what is probably the most accessible and visually stimulating way this area could be seen. As always, the park rangers are very knowledgeable and ecstatic to answer questions. While you can see the Painted Desert for tens, and maybe even hundreds, of miles beyond the park boundaries (as well as petrified wood, given the amount for sale outside the park), this park is worth a stop for the 1 1/2 ride through. Though not quite interactive as other parks, we did a few short hikes - I believe the Crystal Forest hike was one, and it was worth it, even in the hundred degree heat. I don't know that this park is worth a special trip, but if you are within an hour or two of it, it is worth a stop - give yourself about 2 1/2 total hours minimum, and that would not include much walking at all.","June 29, 2012",Worth a stop along the way,12,"Chicago, Illinois",4

The differences in the landscape were incredible, from red rocks to grey moonlike landscapes. The petriglyphs were interesting and easy to see with the help of a park ranger and a handy telescope.

Painted Desert,"My husband and I have always wanted to see the Painted Desert and to go to the Petrified Forest.Growing up you hear about the wonders of the national parks and all the beautiful things to see, but when your family lives on a budget it is hard to go to such places. So it might have taken 4o plus years to go to these to wonderful parks but the wait was well worth it. I can not say how beautiful and amazing the view was in the Painted Desert. There are several pull off spots so you can get out and take pictures. The Petrified Forest is unbelievable, the size of some of the logs is simply amazing. It is so hard to imagine that those pieces of scattered logs now turned to crystallize rock where once giant trees billions of years ago....We had a wonderful time, however if you decide to go you will need to go early. We started to run out of daylight and had to skip a few places. This is only due to the fact that we stopped at Meteor Crater first...","June 26, 2012",National Parks,24,"Beavercreek, Ohio",5

Painted Desert,"Like the song says, ""They've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil."" Well, the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert National Park has an awful lot of petrified wood in it for you to see. Paths allow you to walk among the mineralized remains of trees that grew a long, long time ago. But please, if you want a souvenir, buy a piece at the Petrified Wood Company in nearby Holbrook, AZ. (See my review of the place.) Way too much of the park was carted away in the late 19th and early 20th century. Leave it as you found it.At other spots, such as Newspaper Rock, you can see the cryptic messages carved into stone by Native Americans that lived many hundreds of years ago. You'll also see the remains of their pueblo. Then there are the colorful geologic formations of the Painted Desert. Along the way, you'll pass a monument to ""The Mother Road,"" Route 66, which used to pass through the park. A rusted out 1930s-era car and a bench made from a 1950s Cadillac grille and bumper mark the spot where old Route 66 crosses the park road. (Coincidentally, the box set of the ""Route 66"" TV series from the early 1960s was just released this year (2012). I was inspired to buy it because of this trip.)There's a visitor center at the North end of the park. The center itself isn't so much but there's a Fred Harvey gift shop and restaurant co-located there. If you don't know the history of the Fred Harvey park concessions, you might want to look up that tiny but fascinating bit of Americana.Allocate most of a day if you want to see everything in this park. If petrified wood is your only thing, you'll still need a couple of hours to drive in and walk. A visit to this park is definitely not a ""drive up, click-click, and on your way"" sort of experience. You will want to savor the treats of this particular National Park.","June 13, 2012",Lots to see from petrified wood to petroglyphs to painted desert to the bones of Route 66,180,"San Jose, California",5

I saw no other cars or people for at least an hour as I went straight towards the overlooks (Chinde Point my fav) bypassing the visitor center. The weather was perfect, I sat there all alone in silence looking out over that gorgeous desert. I took me forever to leave! FYI: pack a lunch/drinks, get there there early, stay all day! Don't forget to venture south to the grasslands/badlands of the park.I also enjoyed Puerco Pueblo and searching for the Petroglyphs. The Blue Mesa trail is 1 mile but worth it....

Painted Desert,"The park has north and south entrances, with about 27 miles of roadway between. At the northern end is the Painted Desert. The overlooks are beautiful and picturesque. The southern portion, south of I-40, holds the Petrified Forest, petroglyphs, and the remains of a pueblo. We also checked out Blue Mesa. The petroglyphs include Newspaper Rock, holding over 250 petroglyphs. This is definitely worth at least a drive-through, stopping at the map locations. We didn't have time for the trails, but there are several. The Petrified Forest was fascinating - huge logs in the middle of all of that desert, with no trees in sight.

The Painted Desert, on the other hand, was boring after the first few overlooks. The red color from iron was all that was seen. It was hard to tell where the Badlands ended and the Painted Desert begain-they looked the same. The Petroglyphs at both parks were also worth viewing.","June 4, 2012",Petrified Forest better than Painted Desert,68,"Elkton, MD",3
Painted Desert,"This is more of a driving day trip east of Holbrook, AZ. There are a lot of view points and a few hiking trails (not many). The road passes through Petrified Forest and Painted Desert National Parks, so you combine the two into one trip. Don't expect to see any kind of forest (nothing standing), just prehistoric, petrified logs and pieces of logs scattered about the terrain. It's interesting to get a close look at what a petrified log looks like (very beautiful), but once you've see several dozen, they all begin to look the same. You can't take any piece of rock from the park (an yes they do check your vehicles), but many vendors outside the park sell pieces of petrified wood and finished/polished pieces of the stone/wood (very beautiful) - see Jim Gray's in Holbrook for a large display of finished/raw pieces.","May 30, 2012",Combine with Petrified Forest for an easy day trip from Holbrook,202,"Whitby, Canada",3

Outside of the park at the western end of the Petrified Forest is one of my favorite tourist souvenir shops. It has been a few years since I was there, but the shop has a large bin of geodes for sale and for a nominal fee they will slice your geode so that you can see if there are beautiful crystals inside.

Some of the trees look just like normal wood while others were gorgeous colored agates. The northern part is the Painted Desert portion. Blue Mesa is definitely worthwhile.

I recommend this place for anyone who enjoys the outdoors, nature, and learning about our environment. The petrified trees are gorgeous. There are 3 visitor facilities in the park. The Painted Desert Center has a 20-minute orientation movie and exhibits. Painted Desert Inn National Historic Landmark is a Pueblo Revival-style structure with cultural history exhibits. Rainbow Forest Museum has exhibits about petrified wood, geology, and paleontology. All visitor facilities have bookstores, restrooms and rangers there to answer any of your questions. The park road is 28 miles and offers overlooks with long-distance vistas with access to hiking trails. Make sure you take the Blue Mesa hike. It is a 3 mile loop road with views of the badlands, log falls, and pedestal logs and a strenuous and steep self-guiding 1 mile loop trail.It is absolutely gorgeous. Also the Cyrstal Forest is a great area as well. It is .8 mile easy paved trail through a landscape of exquisitely colorful petrified logs that once held glassy amethyst and quartz crystals.There are other places to see as well such as Tawa Point and Rim Trail, Kachina Point and Rim Trail, Puerco Pueblo, Newspaper Rock, The Tepees, and the Giant Logs Trail.

This part of the park is the Petrified Forest, where most of the petrified wood and big logs are. By starting this way, you will be able to walk the trails and take the time you need to see the petrified logs. You will also be able to drive the Blue Mesa scenic rd, take your time stopping at the vistas and even hike the short trail down into the badlands. Driving north on the park road, you will reach the Painted Desert area. There are many vistas and even if the sun is setting, the views remain beautiful, changing the colors along. This is about why it is best to visit the park from south to north. In this area, also stop at the Painted Desert Inn: an old hotel with very very nice indian paintings on the walls, free to visit.

To get the most out of this gem, you need to time your visit and get out of your car.I would recommend that you start at the south end of the park around mid-afternoon. Walk the Big Logs trail to the Agate House. It's only a mile, the trail is asphalt or packed dirt - it's an easy walk and you could use the exercise after driving so long. The trail is surrounded by petrified wood and here you will be able to view it very closely and see the colors and patterns in detail. It also gives you some views of the Painted Desert area in the distance. After your hike, work your way north, stopping at a few of the pull outs, timing your arrival at the north end of the park at about an hour (or less) before sunset. The sun, being lower in the sky, will reveal more of the color and texture of the landscape. It is far more inspiring at this time of day than the when the sun is high.

We did drive by one observation area but we guilted ourselves into going back; it was worth it. The Blue Mesa trail is worth the hike if you are going to get out of your car. Please keep in mind that we went in March so weather was cooler.Be sure to ask the rangers for an activity book at the petrified forest entrance visitors center; they did not have them at the painted desert entrance.

Definitely stop to see the petrogryphs (indian drawings on the rocks throughout the park) and Don't steal any of the artifacts!

Painted Desert,"We actually stopped to see Petrified Forest National Park and didn't realize Painted Desert was part of the park. What a nice surprise! The scenery is gorgeous—somewhere between the red rocks of southern Utah and the Badlands of South Dakota. Perhaps our favorite part of Painted Desert was the Painted Desert Inn. It's an amazing piece of history and a quick tour—or longer, if you want to take your time. We spent about 30 to 45 minutes at the inn and enjoyed talking with the ranger in the gift shop there. The kids were not as thrilled about the scenery, but the Junior Ranger program helped them get more out of the visit than they would have otherwise. We could have spent a lot more time here, but we just didn't have the time. We will likely be back!Note: There are two entrances, one about 20 minutes outside of Holbrook, Arizona, and one immediately off of I-40. Petrified Forest is first when you enter from Holbrook, and Painted Desert is first when you enter from I-40.

Pretty much had the place to ourselves. A half-dozen overlooks with large parking lots. I can only imagine what the place is like in the summer. The colors were more muted than I remembered. In this case the photographs you see in National Geo are better than the reality. I imagine they might have been brighter if it had recently rained.The park rangers are very stern regarding taking anything (petrified wood, fossils) out of the park and staying on the prescribed paths. They also have a BIG BROTHER attitude by which I mean that when you receive your packet of info when you enter the park you will be given a form on which you can rat on your fellow tourists should you see anybody breaking the rules. There are spaces you can fill in like Time, Place, Violation, License Tags #, Physical Description. I think you're supposed to turn these in at the visitor center so that they can dispatch a S.W.A.T. Team to arrest the miscreants. Is this a great country or what?The views from the overlooks are stunning and if you're interested in geology then this is a place you'd probably want to see.

They look cool, but unless you have a strong interest in geology, it's not going to be a long visit. We did hike further down to where the longest petrified logs were. It was hot and dry. So bring plenty of water even if the trail isn't long. The kids had fun just to get out and look around. Afterwards, we just drove through the park stopping at certain stops to take pictures.

The Rainbow Forest, Painted Desert, fossils, ancient rock art, Route 66 and more is all here. Be sure to see the Blue Mesa and take the short loop trail if possible (some climbing at the beginning and end). Time your visit for early morning and late afternoon/evening if possible as the low angle of the sun brings out the colors of the landscape in a dramatic fashion; mid-day colors can be surprisingly flat. We timed our trip to arrive in the afternoon and entered at the south an worked our way north to see Blue Mesa and the Painted Desert near closing and the colors were amazing. We stayed overnight in Holbrook and arrived the next morning at the North entrance when the park opened and enjoyed the colors of the Painted Desert in more detail, stopped at Newspaper Rock, the Route 66 sight and Native American ruins among other stops arriving at Blue Mesa to take the loop trial before the heat of the day set-in.

Painted Desert,"The first thing that I would recommend is not to visit during the warmer months. It was hot there in November and no shade anywhere. I can't imagine getting in the car, getting the a/c going and then stopping a quarter of a mile down the road, turning the car off and getting out again. The drive through the park is about 27 miles and at least a dozen stops and mini hikes along the way. It is beautiful, almost a very flat version of the Grand Canyon, but the scenery is outstanding and the train running through the park just added to the serenity of it all. The petrified wood was neat to see up close but as soon as you leave the park, there are businesses selling the same petrified wood that we were just taking pictures of. That is a little disappointing. Overall, I would recommend this to people that are new to Arizona, or family or friends from the northeast or midwest that don't see the desert and mountains too often.

In the Fred Harvey bookstore is a restaurant designed to be reminiscent of the Route 66 glory days. Great photos, posters,and signs on the walls. Copies of news articles and brochures under the glass on the tables. The Painted Desert Inn, now a museum is nicely restored and a great stop. One could not help but imagine how it would have appearred to Route 66 travelers after miles of travel through the Desert. Don't miss the stained glass skylights, very unique, the dining counter, and peek into the hotel rooms. From one of the lookouts, back to the east, one can see the abandoned trading post along the old Route 66 roadway.

The Painted Desert extends from slightly east of Flagstaff to an area east of the small section enclosed by the national park. Much of it is not accessible except by rough roads (and is part of the Hopi Indian Reservation). The best time to visit is either late afternoon when the sun is relatively low in the sky from the west, or early morning, when the sun is still low in the sky from the east. The angle of the sun highlights the multiple colors, particularly from Chinde Point. At noon, the light tends to mute, rather than highlight.

Very few people were visiting which was a pity as nature's beauty is magnificent. We were a bit rushed for time so we visited both parks in about 2.5 hours, would've liked to stay longer.","October 21, 2011",Amazingly Beautiful,66,"Dubuque, Iowa",5

You can get a good taste of this park in just a few hours, or you can spend an entire day and see just about everything. Great photo ops abound. Take water if you plan on doing any hiking.

Painted Desert,This was a highlight of our trip. Photographs can never capture the depth and expanse that your eye can see. The Painted Desert is truly a beautiful pastel watercolor painting by Mother Nature. The various colors of sand and stone stretching as far as the eye can see are magnificent. We stopped for a picnic and one of the many covered tables at Chinde Pointe overlook.

Painted Desert,"After venturing most of the day through the petrified forest this was a beautiful ending to our day. I wrote a review about the petrified forest itself, but this needed a seperate praise all on its own. We toured around most of Arizona's desert and this was certainly different to anything we saw. The colors were amazing and I can see where artist's get their inspiration from. We didn't hike down into any of the valleys but decided to take photos from up above, it was pretty hot when we decided to visit the park and we were almost out of water by this point. This is must see if you like another side to Arizona's beautiful desert.","September 14, 2011",More than words can say...,123,Arizona,5
Painted Desert,"We just got back from a trip that included the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert. It was a surprise stop, we were headed from Grand Canyon to Carlsbad and it was en route. I was delighted, the whole place was breathtaking! There is a visitor center at each end, so you can get info and maps. The stops are clearly marked, the trails are not too long and are interesting enough for the adults and the kids can run around and get out some energy while still enjoying the scenery-even if they are not enthralled by the history. I really enjoyed the drive through the park, being able to get out and touch things (and put them back!) as well as walk among the colors and enjoy the scenery up-close was much more fun for me than the Grand Canyon because no matter how much walking you do there, it's mainly views ahead and behind! The Petrified Forest and Painted Desert felt like more of an immersion in the surroundings and still had stunning views into the distance.Be sure you have water and sunscreen! That sun will sneak up on you, it's very windy here and you won't feel burned or dried out until later-when it's too late to do much more than patch yourself up!","September 14, 2011",Liked it more than the Grand Canyon!,13,Alabama,4
Painted Desert,"Been here several times. The colors are best right after a nice calm rain, makes them pop. A good telephoto lens at Newspaper Rock makes the petroglyphs easier to see and photograph the favorites. Usually have to spend the entire day.

Painted Desert,"It was really hot when we visited the Petrified Forest and Painted Desert. I think that if it had been cooler, we would have enjoyed it more, because we would have looked around more. The Petrified Forest has a visitor center and movie, as well as rangers that talk to you about it. We walked on one of the short trails, It was interesting, but after you have seen a few petrified trees, they are all pretty much the same. The rest of the park is driving through. There are a few points that you can stop and get out and look around. Those are interesting also. The Painted Desert is beautiful. We also enjoyed Newspaper Rock, which is covered with petroglyphs and Agate Bridge. The best part of the park were the Indian ruins. They were very interesting. It is something that you don't want to miss, a part of America, but not something that I would travel far just to see. We were on our way to the Grand Canyon, so it made a nice little side trip.","August 21, 2011",Educational,30,"Shreveport, Louisiana",4
Painted Desert,"The loop at the top, northern end of the Petrified Forest drive will take you around the Painted Desert – aptly named and well worth seeing in its own right. It sure does look as if a giant painter had put down his color palette. Not to be outdone by the stunning colors of the petrified wood in the Petrified Forest, the desert proves it is more than dull sand and rock, should anybody think so. Make sure you still have some time to devote to this part of your excursion, to stop and explore and hike down into these psychedelic rainbow hills – and don’t miss the movie at the visitor center.","August 20, 2011",like a giant painter's color palette,716,"Wickenburg, Arizona",5
Painted Desert,"Avoid the entrance fee if you have an America the Beautiful National Parks Annual Pass. We stopped at this park on the return portion of our cross country trip. Since we had stayed at the Wigwam Motel in Holbrook the night before, we had a very short drive and an early arrival in the park so it was not crowded at all. If traveling from the West to the East, take 180 and start in the South Entrance of the park, drive just over 20 miles and exit at the Northern side near I 40. If driving East to West, start with the film at the Visitors Center near the I 40 entrance.The South Entrance Rainbow Forest Museum has a map of the United States with samples of petrified wood found in each different state. It also has a gift store next door where you can purchase legally harvested petrified wood in all colors, shapes, sizes, and price ranges (few dollars to a few thousand dollars). As we learned, petrified wood is found all over the US, this park just happens to have one of the largest collections in the world. It is against the law to touch or gather any rocks from the park, you and your vehicle could be searched.There are quite a few places where you can park your car and walk around for a closer look. The map/brochure we received at the entrance gate has good descriptions of what to expect at each viewpoint and the approximate amount of walking. We spent four hours in this park and stopped at most of them. Newspaper Rock lookout point is high above the rocks where the petroglyphs are located. Using binoculars would be perfect. Crystal Forest is a nice easy walk in and around all the fallen logs but keep in mind it does get hot on a summer day. Bring water, wear sunglasses, a hat and use sunscreen. The logs are on the ground, there is no shade what so ever.There is also a Route 66 Memorial. If you are driving by and see an old abandoned car in the middle of the desert next to a row of old telephone poles, you are looking at the memorial. The Mother Road used to pass right through the park before I 40 came along. This brought many tourists into town which also raised some problems with people taking ""souvenir"" rocks. Sadly a lot of the petrified wood is no longer here.The Painted Forest Desert Inn has been beautifully restored. Not much more then the building itself and a small gift shop inside but it was worth a quick stop. A very nice lady working in the gift shop was more then willing to tell us about the park. There are several lookouts nearby offering beautiful views.The Visitors Center near the I-40 entrance has a fabulous film explaining the history of how the petrified rock is made, the history of the Holbrook area, and the steps the National Park system has in place to preserve what is left for future generations. Do not miss this part of your park visit.","August 16, 2011",Do not miss the film in the Visitors Center,88,"Norfolk, Virginia",5
Painted Desert,"The Petrified Forest National Park is a great destination spot or a place along the way. My twenty-year-old daughter and I were on a cross-country road trip when we picked Petrified Forest to visit instead of Grand Canyon. (We had been to GC once before) We got there just in time to make the 21 mile drive before the gates closed at 7pm and saw the park at sunset.Gorgeous! If you get there before 7, they will let you in to drive through the park without stopping. The next day we went back for a more thorough visit. The Crystal Desert is filled with colorful pieces of petrified wood and there is a great walkway through it that is host to all manner of desert creatures and flora. We saw colorful lizards and desert roses, things you miss driving by... Check out the Petrified Bridge. Don't gather artifacts from the Forest!!! It is illegal and bad karma. Leave this place as is for future visitors. There are plenty of souvenir places outside the park.","August 15, 2011",Stunning grandeur amid seemingly flat nothingness,13,"New York City, New York",5
Painted Desert,"I have passed the exit for the Painted Desert and never before stopped. Now I realize what a shame that is. It was absolutely amazing. The desert has so many colors, and every curve you go around reveals more colors and formations. We took several of the trails, and wish we had time to complete them all, as none of them disappointed. Take a lot of water and sunscreen and a brimmed hat, and good walking shoes. (There are some easy trails that we saw people in sandals doing, but the most impressive are more difficult trails which require some stamina.","August 9, 2011",Stark and hypnotic beauty,10,New Mexico,5
Painted Desert,"An interesting, if small, national park. We went to the main Visitor’s Center and took the basic tour. Our tour guide talked to us inside (it was hot!) for about 20 minutes. He was quite knowledgeable outside just his usual speech and clearly really loved what he was talking about. Then he took us outside for about 20 minutes and we walked through the 4/10 mile loop through the petrified logs in this area. (For those of you that don’t know, there are no upright trees – these are all fallen, broken logs that were buried and mineralized 220 million years ago before being brought up and uncovered by the powers of plate movements and erosion.) Then we drove out from the visitor center and into the Painted Desert. It was a pretty 20 miles drive, and there were quite a few places to stop along the way and walk for a bit or enjoy a scenic overlook. Over all, this is really a half day park – this is probably the shortest we ever stayed in any national park, about three hours. This is a good park to stop at on your way to other places, but I would not make a trip just to visit this park.","August 8, 2011",Short but interesting,52,"Laguna Beach, California",4
Painted Desert,Allow at least 2-3 hours to see this attraction properly. You can stop at several places along the way for great photo opportunities.

It will give you the history of the area.,"August 7, 2011",Absolutely stunning scenery!,221,"Brisbane, Australia",5
Painted Desert,"We had two small kids, two teens and 3 adults in our motorhome. Drove from 180 up to 40. I'd say if this was out of your way don't go. If you're traveling on 40 then you should absolutely go thru the forest. Give yourself at least 2-3 hours or you're just totally wasting your time. We spent about 5-6 hours, including walking a few short trails, stopping for pics at lots of overlooks, and taking a lunch break during a short and crazy storm that passed thru. We didn't really spend time at the Visitor Center. We started at the other end so were just a bit done by time we got to this end of it. The lookout points at the Painted Desert park of the Forest are the best though, really, really terrific views! After this I'd suggest checking out the Blue Mesa Loop, the Crystal Forest and the Rainbow Forest Museum at the other end of the park. At the Museum make sure to walk the short trails in the back, see the Giant Logs. All the teens and the adults had a casual good time here. If you're traveling east on the 40 go thru Holbrook, it's an interesting little town, to the 180. Drive thru the Forest back to the 40, it's well worth it. If you're going west, obviously you want to reverse that course.","August 1, 2011",Worth the stop if on the way,29,Temecula,5
Painted Desert,We have driven by Petrified National Forest/Painted Desert more times than I can count on our way to Flagstaff but never stopped. The visitor's center is literally right off the I-40 exit. I can't even tell you how much my kids (ages 5-11) enjoyed learning about this National Park. I suggest watching the short video at the visitor's center and participating in the Junior Ranger program. The drive through the park (maybe about 20 miles or so) is well worth it. There is so much diversity and so many different kinds of things to see on your way through. Well worth the couple of hours that we spent exploring.

I am big on national parks in general but didn't have very high expectations of this one even though my dad and uncle told me earlier in the week how awesome it was. Coming from the west on 40, be sure to start on the south end so you can come back out on 40. We kind of rushed through it, but what we saw was great and if you can spare at least an hour, make it through this great bit of scenery.","June 21, 2011",Why would anyone ignore it?,4,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Painted Desert,"Amidst a 6,000 mile round trip expedition out west the last place I wanted to stop was a random desert in the middle of who-knows-where Arizona. My dad was set on going to the Petrified Forest National Park in Chambers, Arizona and more specifically the Painted Desert. After 6 hours in the car, all I wanted to do was get out of the endless nothingness of New Mexico and Arizona and reach the promise of California. My plan did not include a stop in the middle of a desert of all plans. I was pleasantly surprised. At first I didn’t even get out of the car but I figured I might as well make my time worthwhile. So I hopped out of the car and climbed the first hill. I was caught after that. I continued to trek into the depths of the desert, exploring the vast arroyos and dirt mountains. A fifteen minute stop quickly turned into a two hour expedition with no real end in sight. By the time we turned around we could barely make out the road and parking lot behind us. We only returned because of impending thirst. This all being said, I would highly recommend a stop at the Petrified Forest National Park if you’re traveling through the Arizona deserts. But bring water and be prepared for a multi hour stop.","March 6, 2011",Beautiful Desert,7,"Mariemont, Ohio",5

Painted Desert,"I really like the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest National park because each stop has some thing very different. The painted desert overlooks have awesome views with amazing colors. The blue mesa has a great walking trail. Newspaper Rock is one of the best exampls of petroglyphs I've ever seen. The Jasper Forest give an idea of just how extensive the petrified forest really is. The Crystal Forest give you an opportunity to get up close to the trees. The whole park has the look and feel of another planet.Whenever I go, I find that I run out of time and room on my camera before I run out of desire to stay longer.When you go, please remember the following: The nearest town is Holbrook at almost 20 miles away. Bring your own food and don't expect to find a hotel close by. Also, the painted desert has the best color and most interesting appearance at sunrise and sunset. Therefore, try to be at the northern overlooks at those times.Enjoy!","July 18, 2010",A visit worth every second,68,"Houston, TX",5

Painted Desert,"We took a long road-trip in April 2010 that included many stops in New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada. One stop was at the visitor center for the Petrified Forest National Park/ Painted Desert. We watched the 20-minute film and shopped in their gift shop. It’s illegal to take any of the petrified wood from inside the park, but you can buy petrified wood in the gift shop (collected from sources outside the park). We drove through the Petrified Forest and made several stops along the way. We took lots of photos as the scenery was just beautiful. We spent about 3 hours in the park; it was really pretty to see the colors in the Painted Desert and all the petrified logs.","June 1, 2010",The scenery was just beautiful!,29,"Montgomery, Alabama",5
Painted Desert,"(Our visit—29 March, 2010) Everyone kept telling us to see the desert at sunset, but when we were there, they closed up tight by 1700. However, as the park ranger stated, anything after about 1400 shows off the Painted Desert colors (sun directly overhead takes away from seeing all the various shades). So we started our venture on the south end, first taking the Giant Logs loop right outside the visitor’s center (we also enjoyed the short film on the making of the Petrified Wood). I had never seen petrified wood in a natural setting before and certainly never in the huge amounts as on the loop and throughout the park. As you drive along, you see it everywhere, some just beginning its exposure. For our family, the Giant Logs loop was enough for the petrified wood, and we did not stop for any other of the loops for more petrified wood viewing. Further along this 28 mile National Park you begin to see the Painted Desert formations in all their glory. We found the one-mile Blue Mesa loop well worth taking, with it shades of grey. The trail is very steep in parts. Further down the road we enjoyed the Route 66 pull off where the phone lines show where the road once crossed the Park. And of course, as we neared the end of the Park, the Painted Desert showed off it shades of red. At the Northern exit there is a huge Route 66 nostalgia store. Of note: I have been to the South Dakota Badlands’, and I couldn’t help but compare the two (the Badlands’ win). Also, if you have seen petrified wood in other places and don’t think seeing it in ‘bulk’, this too would lessen the experience of the Park for you. Overall, if you are in the area, absolutely make the stop, but I don’t know that I would drive hours out of the way for it.","April 9, 2010",Blue Mesa Loop our favorite…,466,"Vienna, Virginia",3

We were there from 4:30 - 6 pm and the light was just right to accent the variations. There is a visitor center with a 20 minute film (which we missed since we got there at 5:45), and a short trail from a historic landmark building to the next vista point.","March 24, 2010",Beautiful and otherwordly at the same time,17,Central California,4
Painted Desert,"I've been to the Grand Canyon several times in my life, but it was still nice to go back to see the petrified forest and painted desert once more. It's out of the way unless you're already traveling down I40, and takes a while to tour through (perhaps 4 hours). But, nowhere else in our land will you see in one place so many of these giant calcified trees that have reappeared after so many years of erosion. $10 admission. Free guided tours at certain times and places. Good trails to get a closer look at these geological marvels. There are some very good photo opportunities for those who like that. Plan to see the sunset in the painted desert (North end of the park). If you go during the summer months, you won't have that opportunity. Park closes at 7PM. And, don't take anything out. There are several stores that will sell you a piece of petrified tree. It isn't worth the fine, and you steal the opportunity for those behind you to see this park.","September 11, 2009","Not a 1st choice, but still worth seeing.",123,"Fayetteville, Arkansas",4
Painted Desert,"Petrified Forest NP is one of the least spectacular parks I have seen. In fact, the most impressive petrified logs lay just around the visitor center at the entrance of the park.

Painted Desert,"The Painted Desert/Petrified forest is a nice place to see, but I wouldn't give it the same rating as the Grand Canyon! There's a reason the Grand Canyon gets all of the visitors that it does, and that the Painted Desert does not. Is it scenic? Sure! Is it worth spending a day at? No. It is a nice drive through though, and maybe I would spend 2 hours or so driving it and occasionally stopping for a photo here or there. The main road is only 26 miles (+ or -), so it's not like it's going to take you that long anyway, and you can stop at various ruins and scenic viewpoints along the way.

This was one of our favorite spots especially for you closet photographers out there like me. We spent about 4 hours here and wished we had the whole day. There is so much to see and do. So many different hikes to take. The colors in the painted desert was amazing. The petrified wood sprawled out all over was mesmerizing. One of the neatest things was looking at the ends of each piece of wood. The different colors and shapes was just awesome. There were pictographs all over the rocks. There is even an area were there is nothing but old telephone poles and a vehicle in a field showing where Rt 66 used to run along there. All in all, we thought it was fascinating and would not miss it.","November 4, 2008","Beautiful, Interesting and Underrated",71,Ohio,5
Painted Desert,"My husband and I visited on our return trip home from Sedona. We were here many years ago, but it was at sunset and we were really rushed. This time we had more time to explore the area and really enjoy the beauty of it. The booklet from the park rangers at the entrance is very helpful. We drove through the entire area, making pictures from our car and taking several of the shorter hikes. We spent about ½ day there. The petrified wood is really intriguing; you really have to see it. The colors in the wood, as well as the desert colors are beautiful. Don’t miss the Painted Desert Inn hear the northern entrance. The signage along the road didn’t really indicate what that stop was, but the park brochure showed in on the map. The original structure was built in the 1920s, and the petrified wood was used in its construction. Roaming through the building, and thinking of its history, and seeing the views from the back, is well worth the stop. There are restrooms and a bookstore, but the beauty is the building and its history. The bookshop attendant can provide information on that.","May 18, 2008",Definitely a must-see; plan for 3-4 hours to really enjoy,172,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",5
Painted Desert,"My boyfriend and I planned a stop at the Painted Dessert and Petrified Forest along our cross country road trip. At the entrance to the park the rangers give you a booklet of information explaining all there is to see and the history of the park, which was really useful. We went through the park making periodic stops but mostly taking pictures from our car. I can imagine the Painted Dessert would be breathtaking during sunset but it was still gorgeous in the early afternoon, with the sun shining. I kept thinking that it looked so different in person then it did in pictures because the pictures really do capture it like a painting. I don’t think you can take a bad picture in the park; all of ours came out beautifully. It took about 3 hours to drive through the park with stops. We were glad to have planned time for it in our day because you really wouldn’t want to rush through it. Stopping to see the petrified wood and walking through the Rainbow forest was amazing. To see logs that were millions and millions of years old was incredible. The entrance and exit to the park both have gift shops and places to stop before continuing on. The gift shops sell polished petrified wood which is very affordable and makes a great souvenir for your trip; we bought some for ourselves and as gifts. I would recommend this stop to anyone interested in seeing beautiful scenery as well as a piece of history.","April 22, 2008",Gorgeous place to visit!,99,California,5
Painted Desert,"We recently spent a day visiting the Petrified Forest/Painted Desert National Park. What struck me the most about the Petrified Forest was how little of the petrified trees there were left, so many of them have been chipped away, dragged away, stolen or sold. In the museum shop there are several ""books of shame"", filled with letters from people who in the past had stolen pieces of the petrified trees, then realized what they had done, and sent them back with letters of apology. The park service works very hard to preserve what is left of the Petrified Forest, and the pieces of the trees that do remain look like beautiful jewels of every color imbedded into wood, but they are trees, that over the centuries have become very beautiful from the petrification process. We fared a little better visiting the Painted Desert. It was interesting to see the shifting colors of the sand, and see the prehistoric dwellings and paintings that are still there. Having previously visited Lake Powell, Arizona, around Page, there really was no comparison with this ""Painted Desert"" and the colors of the mountains around Page, but this Painted Desert was special in and of itself.I think the Park Service has done a very good job in making this national park as interesting as possible under the circumstances of people stealing pieces of it, and for that reason I think it is important that we show our support and visit this park.When you go, bring comfortable walking shoes, a hat and lots of water. Facilities are few and far between, and it is a very long and hot walk, about a 2 mile circular path, to see the largest trees of the Petrified Forest.","August 15, 2007",Sad to See How This Beautiful National Park Has Been Plundered,2372,"West Long Branch, New Jersey",4

Painted Desert,"Arizona is a beautiful state, no doubt, but this is another one of those attractions that you can stop at one spot along the route and see it all. Much like the Grand Canyon. Once you've seen it, no reason to go back. Beautiful place, very different from the Eastern U.S., but a boring place to visit. I can't imagine children enjoying visiting this place at all. Entrance fee was $10 for two people in a car which is a great price considering it costs a lot of money to maintain a national park.Take drinks and snacks because it's a long slow drive from one end to the other and nothing in between.","November 28, 2006",Blah Blah Blah,105,"Cleveland, Ohio",3
Painted Desert,"Most folks drive right past the Petrified Forrest National Park/Painted Desert on their way to the Grand Canyon without so much as turning their heads. This is a huge mistake. Arizona is blessed with two of the most awesome National Parks in America so close together. The Painted Desert is outstanding. The color palate is breathtaking, and some of the formations look like a mini-Grand Canyon. You have just got to see this place to believe it and understand what I'm talking about. It is a shame for anyone visiting the Grand Canyon to not drive a few extra miles and visit the Painted Desert. Please take the time to visit this national treasure. It is unique and unlike anything you will ever see.","September 21, 2006",Fabulous!! Underrated due to the close proximity to Grand Canyon,115,"Orange County, CA",5
Painted Desert,"The petrified forest is simply very unique. you drive through and just see wood everywhere, sorta like a pumpkin patch. However, you keep driving, you stop take pictures, and look at the incredible colors of the minerals on the wood. There are a lot of other things besides the petrified forest itself, other natural creations that are so pretty. There are a lot of different wildlife, I saw some weird, harmless bug that was white and fuzzy, and lizards. We took a hike at the painted desert, and it was really pretty. Especially around sunset, the time we went, and you just see the colors of the rocks, in different shades. It is not too expensive, and is very different, but if you like parks and seeing unique things and natural attractions this a place you must go to. It is really nice and calm. They also got their gift shops, so you may buy some petrified rock, or other cool things.","November 1, 2005",Amazing,139,"Long Island, NY",5
