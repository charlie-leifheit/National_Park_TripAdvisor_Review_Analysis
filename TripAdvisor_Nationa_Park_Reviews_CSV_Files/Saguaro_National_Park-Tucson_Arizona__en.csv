Saguaro National Park,"Trip Advisor really need to break this listing up into West Side and East side as they are in different locations and have different terrain. The East side is more wild and the West side more manicured. Anyway, we did the a East Side and it was so pretty with lots to see. It is an 8 mile loop drive thru one section of the park with tons of pull outs. There is a vault toilet at the Mica View pull out with a mile walking trail to get up close to the cactus. They have a rare cristate Saguaro on this trail. There is a visitors center at the entrance with snacks and souvenirs, restroom and a small museum. The entrance fee is $20 per carload. We used our National Park pass. I’m looking forward to seeing the West side! If you go in May the Saguaro’s will be in bloom, crowned with flowers, on the top. There are some hiking trails and picnic tables along the way. Enjoy!","October 15, 2019",Beautiful Saguaro’s! East Side Review,100,"Gold Canyon, Arizona",5

It was maybe 20-30 minutes from town. The visitor center is a bit on the smaller side, but had a nice video presentation and a small exhibit area. The staff working there were a great source of info! I did the 8-mile cactus loop drive and it was great! I took my time, so it took nearly 2 hours with all the area to pull over and plaques to read.

The rock cairns turned east disappeared on the Cactus Wren Trail after a while and we ended up hiking a dry arroyo back up to Golden Gate Road to return to the parking area. Not much wild life seen on this loop.The afternoon was much better. We hiked the Kings Canyon Trail to Sendero-Esperanza Trail, returning on the Gould Mine Trail.

There is an admission fee, I think it's $12. Free if you have a pass, either a lifetime senior pass or an annual pass. Senior passes are $80 and are good for life. Annual passes are also $80. Passes will get you into any National Park site that charges an entrance fee. Many NPS sites don't charge anything though. The Saguaro Forest is beautiful and stark. The history of the site is very interesting. The area is well maintained by the park service. The hiking trails are well marked. Bring water!! Definitely worth the visit.

The ring road is only a few miles long, but it’s a quick and interesting drive and the landscape is beautiful.

Saguaro National Park,"We arrived in Tucson in mid-June to 109F temps. It was too hot to hike, so we decided to drive to the Red Hills Visitor Center before it closed. We had just enough time to watch the video, pick up some park maps, and purchase a few souvenirs before closing time. Afterwards, we also spent about 45 min walking around the Cactus Garden, located just outside the visitor center. It offers a nice display of desert plant life, as well as a great view of the landscape from the outdoor observation decks, accessible even after the visitor center is closed.The next morning, we decided to make an early visit to the Tucson Mtn District of Saquaro NP in an effort to beat the heat. We started with a good SW breakfast at the Coyote Pause Cafe, just a short walk across the parking lot from Cat Mountain Lodge, where we stayed. The restaurant opened at 7:30 am. By the time we left at 8:30 am and drove the short 15min to Saquaro NP, the temp was already pushing 95 F. We had planned to visit the Sonora Desert Museum, which is on the way to Saquaro NP, but opted to skip it due to the rising heat. Our priority was to get at least a couple of quick hikes in at the NP instead.We headed directly to the 6 mile Bajada Loop drive, a well maintained dirt road through a thick stand of saguaros. This road is suitable for most vehicles, but is a bit bumpy in spots. If you have a motorhome or other large vehicle, it would be best to check road conditions with the rangers before driving. The saguaros are incredible along this scenic route. We stopped at many random locations to take photos. Due to the heat, we chose to walk the two shortest trails along the route: Valley View Overlook (0.8 miles) & Signal Hill (0.5 miles). Both of these trails are quite easy, with only a minimal elevation gain. They are not paved, so not suitable for strollers, wheelchairs, or those unable to walk on uneven surfaces.Valley View Overlook - This short out & back trail meanders through saguaros, across 2 washes, and then up a small ridge to a wonderful overlook. You can see the valley below and the Picacha Peak in the distance. Thankfully, there was also a refreshing breeze!Signal Hill Petroglyphs - This short out & back trail zig-zags up a small hill, where you will find several petroglyphs scattered around on rocks. It's an interesting little walk that allows you to get up close. On a cooler day, Signal Hill would be a great location to enjoy a picnic lunch.By this time, it was 11 am and 102 F, so we decided to move on to our next destination, Meteor Crater/Winslow.","July 1, 2019","HOT in June, but cool.",179,Ohio,4

There are plenty of hiking opportunities. If you don't like steep, narrow mountain roads, don't go there by way of Gate's Pass. If you have a larger RV, you'll have to go around the Tucson Mountains to get there, as these are prohibited on Gate's Pass Road.The East has a 9 mile loop road that offers several places to stop and look, including a newer short trail that is wheelchair accessible.

Saguaro National Park,"We visited in June with the temps 100+. Although that curtailed our hiking, the NPS has done an excellent job in the visitor center of providing exhibits and information, including two films, both in the east and west sections of the park. Although the guide books highlight the difference between the two sections, unless you are really into the details both offer an excellent primer on the Sonoran desert. Both also offer short, very well documented trails near the visitor center to point out the highlights of the park. Both also offer a short drive, with the east side a more improved road, but both fine for passenger cars as long as you aren't in a rush. Short trails, enough to get into the park but back into the AC of your car, are available. If weather is cooperative both have many longer hikes that showcase the park. Both are adjacent, almost surrounded by, Tucson so travel isn't difficult. The time I indicated below, more than three hours, is if you see both sections of the park.

June can be very hot as it was 40 deg C (104 deg F) on the day we visited. Take plenty of water and good sunscreen. Great photo ops at every turn. We visited the East National Park. It had a sealed road that made it very easy to get around with ample places to stop and get that special photo. If your a lover of nature, deserts or cactus, this is the place for you.

Saguaro National Park,"Probably one of the most iconic things in the Southwest is the saguaro cactus with its wide spreading arms. We recently took a trip to Arizona and visited East Saguaro National Park in Tucson (there is a west park as well). It's large and has a long, winding road that makes its way through forests of saguaros and other cacti such as cholla, prickly pear, and ocotillo. We were fortunate to be there when they were all blooming, which added color to the trip. There are many turnouts with enchanting views. Might be too long and uneventful for younger children, but it offers a peaceful trip for adults, photographers, and others. Recommended.","June 10, 2019",Saguaros in Bloom,47,"Dallas, Texas",4
Saguaro National Park,"That's the title of a sign in Saguaro National Park East. The single thing I want to mention is that Saguaro National Park East is not the best place to see saguaros. It was created so that visitors could see what was then the most spectacular cactus forest in Arizona, but there were die-offs in 1937 and 1962. Saguaro National Park East has plenty of desert life, including many saguaros--but not in the wild and wonderful profusion you can see elsewhere. I would suggest that if you have limited time, rather than trying to visit both Saguaro National Park East and West, a better choice might be Saguaro National Park West and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. They are just three miles apart. Take your time driving up Kinney Road, which has many, many turnouts where you can stop and look and take pictures.Don't get me wrong, there are spectacular landscapes with lots of saguaros just about everywhere outside of town--including Saguaro National Park East--just be aware that the East (Rincon Mountain district), despite being the original park, is not necessarily the richest or most overwhelming stand.The introductory film in the visitor's center at Saguaro National Park West was great--no spoilers but there is one really clever and surprising moment at the end. In it, a member of the Tohono O'odham nation mentions that they almost of think of saguaros as people, and when you look at a big stand of them on a hill, after a while you will start to see them as people.","June 9, 2019","""Where have all the Saguaros gone?""

There are trails of various lengths and ability levels. On the Signal Hill Trail, we saw some cool petroglyphs on rocks. However, the sign warning people of rattlesnakes and Africanized bees made me nervous. Luckily, we didn’t encounter either. Later that afternoon, we visited the east area, which is about 45 minutes away. The cactuses are much more spread out, but still very pretty.

Saguaro National Park,TIP: DECIDE AMONG 2 PARKS. Choose which one of the 2 saguaro national parks you want since it's a 1 hour drive between the East park to West park. The interstate and City of Tucson divides the locations. One park is called “Saguaro National Park East” and the other is called “Saguaro National Park Tucson Mountain District (West).”. I personally like the west park a bit more for the scenery just driving there & for the adjacent open- air desert museum . The scenic approaches for the West park include: The local road over GATES PASS (breathtaking as It winds from hill to valley); or the PICTURE ROCKS ROAD (a bit flatter but still scenic); or the SANDARIO ROAD (which is more direct if you are heading to Desert Museum).TIP: THE DRIVE ALONE IS WORTH IT… it is a free mini-excursion per the ride itself out to the west national park on local roads -- perfect for a quick view by car if your time is limited.,"May 13, 2019",Best way to see the desert,44,"New York City, New York",5

As a new photographer, I really enjoyed exploring different techniques and filters. The weather was perfect when we visited.

Saguaro West (Tucson Mountain) is really nice, and it is especially worthwhile to make the really short, really east hike up to see the 1600-year old Petroglyphs. They place you in the footsteps of ancient peoples.However, I am always blown away by my time in the East (Rincon Mountain) District of the park, on the east end of the Tucson valley. It's a bit wetter and greener since weather tends to bump into its mountains and sheds rain. The 8-mile fully-paved Cactus Forest Loop Drive is a great way to experience the Sonoran Desert without leaving your vehicle. That alone is worth the inexpensive price of admission. And there are several short hikes that start right at the side of the road. Maybe the most amazing time to visit is Feb through April. Weather is comfortable, and the flora is blooming/exploding from winter rains. When you consider the Cactus Forest loop comprises about 1% of the entire park, it will leave you in awe of our predecessors' foresight to begin protecting this area in 1933.

Saguaro National Park,"This location is very unique and takes a determined traveler to get there. I recommend using GPS. On the way to the visitors center you will travel through a segment of the park that is just stunning in vistas and varieties of cactus growing. Once at the visitors center, there are maps, a fresh water fill station, rest rooms, a gift store and a beautiful pavilion for observing the wild landscape. A short walking trail will guide you around the exterior of the building through different plants that are local to the area. The visitors center also offers a brief presentation ( held indoors) in the visitors center. We enjoyed the unique experience and are thankful to the National Parks Service employees on site for their help and kindness during our visit.","April 6, 2019",Wonderful national park !,177,"Freehold, NJ",4

Saguaro National Park,Visited both East and West portions of the park. The nine mile loop road in the East end was full of blooming flowers. The cactus were everywhere and with the Catalina Mountains as a back drop made the one-way drive eye candy. The West portion was also full of blossoms but darkness drove me out.

Saguaro National Park,A great way to visit this park is by bike. The Saguaro Park East road is approximately 8 miles long. It is an one way loop and the cars are very accommodating to cyclists. The scenery is incredibly beautiful and there are many pull out areas to take pictures. The picnic area near the end of loop is also a great place to stop for a food break and there are washrooms. The only downside of this ride is that cyclist are also charged an admission fee of $10 per rider. ,"March 24, 2019",Taking in desert scenery by bike!,21,"Toronto, Canada",5

We enjoyed spending a day on each side, but if you had to pick one over the other, I enjoyed the hiking in the east. We parked at the Douglas Spring Trailhead at the end of Speedway road and did a 5 mile hike up to the bridal falls.

Fun fact: this National Park lies within city limits, the only one to do so. Also, it's split in two. One must exit, drive through Tucson, and enter on the other side to see the rest.

We got a late start, did the Desert Museum first, and did not leave enough time for stunning Saguaro. A view from the deck outside the lovely Visitors Center revealed a slope absolutely covered with saguaros - like so many green sticks pointing to the very blue sky. We had time for a drive on the Bajada Loop, an unpaved but very passable roadway. At its center is the Signal Hill picnic area. A short trail to some very interesting Hohokum petroglyphs.

Saguaro National Park,"We did East Saguaro today arriving around 2 p.m. There was plenty of parking and the traffic was light. After picking up a map and a hiking guide at the Rincon Mountain Visitor Center, we drove the nine mile loop once to just take in all the views and a second time to pick a trail head so we could do a hike. We picked the Loma Verde Loop. It was supposed to be 2 hours and 3.8 miles but after a few wrong turns, we ended up hiking the Loma Verde Shantz Vanover Monument Wash and Squeeze Pen trail. Our total hiking time was nearly three hours and closer to 7 miles. We liked the Monument Wash because you will walk along a crystal clear creek that you dip your feet in. Bring plenty of water (in case you take a wrong turn like we did). The trail heads are actually marked pretty very well. We hiked in our tennis shoes and thought it was fine - you can leave the hiking boots at home. Bring the camera - we saw three three jack rabbits.

Huge Suagaro that don't even,get a first arm until they are 75 years old. Weighing 7 tons - fascinating. The parks here, and all of the surrounding grounds are very similar. We did Sabino Canyon, Mountain Park, Sanora Desert Museum grounds, the Lemmon Mountain drive all looked rather similar with some elevation differences. We hiked three times... Similar.

Saguaro National Park,"The drive through Saguaro National Park is beautiful and a great place to see desert vegetation. They probably need a sign of no dogs in the visitors center or near the restrooms. I had to keep moving around in the visitors center because someone brought a bulldog into the visitors center and I am allergic to dogs. The dog owner just let the dog wind around peoples legs and yelled loudly that.it was a service dog. It was the worst behaved service dog I had ever seen, pulling on the lease and almost knocking people over. Then they sat outside with the dog in front of the restrooms and made it diffficult to get into the restroom without tripping over a dog. Is the park for people or dogs?

Saguaro National Park,We mostly drove through this park trying to find the visitors center. We found it tucked in the back but you could see almost everything just from driving through it. We also hit the petroglyph mound which was cool to see and took you up a little bit which provided a good view of the surrounding area. The park has paved paths near the visitors center also which make for easy viewing.

Biking the loop is also a treat, probably not for kids though. The West section is a little harder to reach, but worth it. The scenic dirt road loop is interesting and takes you to a short uphill hike to see petroglyphs on top of a commanding view of the desert.

Yes there are several stops at trailheads where you can hike but there are also lots of scenic overlooks where you can see amazing views.

A little John Wayne or even maybe Marshall Dillon and Kitty. Let's not forget Geegory Peck and James Stewart.They were the stars but many supporting actors made the difference.

The East Park has a great 8-mile one way loop. There is a worthwhile hike through the cactus forest to Lime Falls. There is also a terrific one way loop in the West Park.

I did the back areas hike with a tour guide to get an up close look at the really big Saguaro's that are close to 200 years old where most tourists don't get to go and the tour guide was very knowledgeable. Their gift shop had some cool things where I found a stuffed lizard for my grandson. The parking situation is tight because there might be a line to get into the actual park and if you parked close to the entrance where you pay to get in, you might be waiting several minutes to back out or will be waiting for a chance to reverse out of your parking spot unless another vehicle lets you back out. Once you get into the park, take your time as the views are spectacular and you might come across some wildlife. I saw a roadrunner run across the road, pretty cool.

It is interesting due to being close to civilization; there are developments with large lots nearby. Photographers will like this section due to having elevations that permit overall scenics as well as plant details. Also a short trail leads to the Freeman Homestead, so you will see man's impact as well as getting away from the road. Gearwise, we carried DSLRs with zoom lens, no tripod, water, and sunhat.

There was no mention on the may at the base of the hill that it was essentially an uphill stair climb to the top, different from a trail as it is an hour's worth of climbing for the first loop.

Saguaro National Park,"This national park is fairly small and accessible. It is divided by Tucson with a section to the east and west of the city. Both parks have a good visitor center with impressive interpretive films. We enjoyed the western section best as it had the greater concentration of cacti. We are past the hiking age so enjoyed the five mile circular gravel drive that took us through the park. We did the short walk (.25 mile) to see the petroglyphs. Our visit was in February so the climate was perfect. I am not sure how hot it might be in the summer. The eastern part of the park is larger and abuts Tucson neighborhoods. The eight mile drive is paved. There are fewer large cacti but lush growth nevertheless. If your time is limited, visit the west portion.","March 1, 2019",Terrific,128,"Greenville, Michigan",5

Saguaro National Park,"This NP is split into two sections East and West. We visited the East side this trip which is known for their driving loop in which there are stop offs you can make to go for a short hikes. We were told the West district is more for mountain hiking trails. Parking at the visitor center was pretty tight, a lot of traffic in the parking lot and in and out of the gate to do the driving loop. The visitor center is chocked full of information, they have videos and exhibits as well as daily ranger led talks. We learned about Thelma the tortoise. :) They have both the Junior Ranger program and a “Not so” junior ranger program for adults. It was a lot of fun but fair warning the answers were hard to find in the East district. If you are on the East side don’t forget to stop by the one of a kind handmade tile mural out front done by local artists.

The Rincon Mountains form an impressive backdrop to the acres of desert with paths leading to all parts of the park. Some are paved for accessibility, while others cross the desert floor or move along washes. Some are also interpreted with panels describing what to look for, while others have signs identifying the various plants. We were lucky enough to find a young fan top saguaro and we saw two jackrabbits We spent over 5 hours hiking and didn't see everything, so it is a multi-day adventure.

But, it worked out well to see this beautiful park with a rare dusting of snow!We drove to the visitor’s center, and picked up some knowledge, and souvenirs! We took the trails around the center, which are easy, and informative. Then we escaped the cold a while by jumping in the car and driving the Bajada Loop— a GREAT way to enjoy the park if the weather isn’t good on your visit. We did stop at the Valley View Overlook trail, and hiked the 0.5 mile easy trail to get a high view. The clouds were low today, and it was still snowing a bit. Our faces got numb, but it was worth the walk!We continued on, a bit too far, because we had to turn around and back track to go to Signal Hill to see the petroglyphs. A short walk up a hill, and there they are— where they’ve been for thousands of years! We really enjoyed our morning in the park, and love that we could enjoy it despite the weather.

The trail is about 1.7 miles one way. The first 0.7 miles is flat but the trail does climb via switch backs about 0ne mile to the ridge.

The west had so many cacti to see which could be done both on foot and just driving through. The west side was way less crowded than the east side where many people exercise outside.

At the visitor center we asked about short, not strenuous hikes.

There's a bench there and we thought it was a good end of the trail. Beautiful scenery, peaceful and yet there were other hikers around. As it turned out this same volunteer, Sarah, gave a talk about the variety of cacti that can be seen in the park. She was very good and very knowledgeable and very interested to tell us all about our surroundings. It really helped to hear her speak first because when we did our walk we were pointing out and naming what she had shown us. Did you know that a saguaro cactus begins to grow sheltered by a plant? Isn't it amazing that scientists have yet to figure out how to determine the age of a saguaro?

You can drive the loop and along the way, there are many spots to get out and explore. Once you get off the path you can get up close and see the true size of these special cacti.

Saguaro National Park,"Living in Florida, the landscape is so different from what we are sued to it's like we are on another planet. The hiking in both east and west parks is excellent. I loved just being in the park and walking along the path - the crunch of the soil/pebbles under my shoe, occasional bird song and flutter, the fresh air, and the varied vegetation. I'm sure these feelings would wane if I lived here and had it all the time, as we humans can become jaded pretty quickly. But for me the visitor, it was stupendous!

Saguaro National Park,"This will be the 10th National Park we visited this year, so it admittedly had some stiff competition. I would rate it about 9th on the list. It's a very nice little set of parks (see notes later) to drive through, and while we did not hike or bike much, it seems like it would be great for both.The park is actually two parks - one on the East and one on the West, with the city of Tucson sitting in the middle. Each has a short drive through so you can see the sights from the comfort of your car. They are different in that the East side is a paved route with wide open spaces of cactii to view, while the West side is a dirt road through a ""forest"" of Saguaros. We went on a Saturday morning, and the crowds were almost non-existent, unlike some parks on the weekends (it was also pretty cold, so maybe that is why). I'm glad we visited.","January 2, 2019",It won't take your breath away but worth the trip if you're nearby,45,"Las Vegas, Nevada",4

Saguaro National Park,"The Saguaro National Park has two non-contiguous sections. One is immediately east of Tucson and the other is to the west of the city. We visited only the west side. I’m told the west side has more Saguaro cacti than the east side but I also hear that the east side is well worth visiting. There are numerous roads, some paved and some not, that you can take to explore the park. In addition, there are numerous hiking trails that wander up the mountain and into the Saguaro “forest.”We went in late December on a bright sunny day when the temperatures never exceeded 50 degrees. I’m sure our experience would be vastly different if we had visited in the summer. If you visit in the summer, you will want to be there at sun-up so you can enjoy the sights before the temperatures reach into triple digits. Facilities in the park are sparse.

Saguaro National Park,"We were surprised that the park was open during the federal government shutdown. The visitors center was closed during the shutdown so no restroom facilities. Also bring water since no drinking fountains were available. Since we could not get park maps, we took a picture of one at the center using our phones. The good thing was that we did not have to pay the entrance fee. The drive was beautiful through the park and around the loop drive. There are no shoulders but lots of cyclists sharing the same road so be watchful of them. There were pullouts along the road so it was nice to get out and walk and take pictures among the large Saguaro Cactus. The parking along the trailheads were very packed so we had to move on.

Saguaro National Park,"I;m not sure why all the sights, hiking trails and scenic drives are listed under Tucson and not under this park heading. See my reviews of all the great things about Saguaro National Park under Tucson. Tripadvisor needs to fix/change this.However, in short - the west side is far better for seeing a LOT of saguaro. In some areas it is almost an overwhelming forest. The west side doesn't seem to be as visited as well, so you are more likely to find some solitude. The road signs could use some better marking though. The east side is more touristy, but also offers far more trails to hike and is very beautiful in its own right. We did the west side one afternoon and then stayed on that side at night, crossed through Tucson the next morning and did the east side the following day. If I had to do it again, I think one full day on the west side would have been better, but I think we covered the east side pretty well in one day, doing the loop drive and a few hikes.","December 15, 2018",Great park.

Both were well worth the drives, but if I had to choose, I would take the Western loop. The Visitor Centers are well worth taking the time to visit. The Western visitor center had a short film that was interesting and informational -- and I loved how the screen raised to a view of the scenery at the end. I highly recommend the paved trails that have quite a bit of information posted about the types of cacti and other information about the park. This park is well worth spending a day!

Saguaro National Park,"If you've never seen a saguaro cactus up close here is your chance. The park is split in two, one on either side of Tucson. We went to the east side park near the Rincon mountains. It costs $15.00 per car to enter park. You can go to the visitor center without paying. They have many hiking trails available and a 9 mile driving tour. The driving loop is one way so you can look and not worry about oncoming cars. But be aware of bicycles, there are many. There are pullouts that have info plaques that tell you about the area. They have some of the biggest saguaros I've ever seen. Also, many other types of cacti and bushes and trees. Listen for the squirrels that sound like birds. The park was very clean and all the people were friendly. We would go back when we could spend more time.

Definitely stop in and get some tips and maps before heading out. It was a beautiful day with just a light breeze in the 70s, a perfect day for hiking. But if you come on a hot day, do you remember to bring lots of water, sunscreen, and a hat. The driving tour is great if you just want to get A taste and her not up for a hot hike.

Saguaro National Park,"You would think that the face of the Saguaro National Park system at the Rincon Mountain District Entrance might care to think they represent something beyond their own personal space that will affect how others view the larger organization – but at Saguaro National Park Rincon Mountain District – we were met by rude, disorganized and what appeared to be impatient and contemptuous staff members who were not only rude to ourselves – but to each other as well. Add that we received 3 different answers for the same question regarding the entry fee, add that we witnessed one staff member snap at another for trying to inform her of the correct answer, add that the entry fee was different than what we were originally told on 3 occasions, add that the gate fee was $10 more than our final quoted price in the office after two staff members bickered with one another publically, and add that one is forced to purchase a “7-day pass” for vehicles and that, according to the woman located at the entry gate, “no one-day” pass exists for vehicles – then the total lack of service becomes ever more a slap in the face by the “cash grab” upon entry.Throw in an extremely poorly marked trail system, poor maps, and the initial disorganized, confusing information and lack of service – and not only should this arm of the National Park system be ashamed of their outfit – but they’ve tainted these world travellers for many years to come, which will reflect on the entirety of the National Park system and go much further than their own personal corner of Saguaro National Park - Rincon Mountain District.We certainly hope that this review is sent on to the higher ups in the National Park organization by someone who realizes that our experience is not the impression that such a national body wants to leave its paying customers. And please see many of the similar reviews that account for the same type of experience.A little kindness and humility would go a long way but the staff at Saguaro National Park – Rincon Mountain District hardly seemed to care.

To a person they extol the natural beauty of our desert best viewed by hiking in a natural setting like this park. It is a wonderful experience. The trails are kept in great condition by employees and volunteers. I always pick up any trash I might find while hiking. I am very happy to report there is little to none to be picked up. (This morning I picked up a small candy wrapper which, I believe, was inadvertently dropped.) I encourage anyone to take some time out to enjoy a leisurely walk/hike through this wonderful park.

Saguaro National Park,"There are two sections to this park, the western side being the original and the eastern side a later addition. The western side is more densely populated with saguaro than the eastern side but they both have something different to offer. The western side is more like a forest of saguaro and the other side has sparse growth but more scenic views. Some of them look like people waving at you or holding their arms out to you, in the dark this would be quite disconcerting. The difference in ages is easy to see, from the limbless youngsters to the withered and dying ancients. The longevity of the saguaro is amazing. Spend some time trying to find wildlife in all the holes in the cacti, you might get lucky, we didn't.

We were disappointed in how small the parking lots were for cars to park and you to get out and walk around - if one person parked poorly, there was no space for anyone else to stop and see.If you are around Tucson, check this out.

I recommend hiking very early in the day if you're going to hike out into the desert proper as to avoid the mid day heat (if you hike at dawn or dusk, be aware Crepuscular critters).

We didn't do much hiking due to heat and monsoons. Rincon is also close to the East side of town which is where we were staying; so, we actually went twice.

The staff was helpful and seemed passionate about their jobs.The loop at Tucson Mountain contains a neat and easy walk to some petroglyphs. I enjoyed this very much! A portion of this loop is unpaved. We had a rental SUV which did fine; but I would hesitate taking a low sedan as the road was very uneven at times.

Saguaro National Park,Saguaro NP East: Great place for easy or hard hikes. Lots of trails in the Cactus Forest area but make sure you stop at the visitor center to get a map first!!! Trails form a maze and it’s easy to get lost without a map! Bridal Wreath Falls trail is hard but beautiful especially when the falls are running. Make sure to go to Ernie’s Falls too. Oh and I’ve seen too many visitors without enough water!!! In the desert you need water!!! For those who don’t want to hike you can drive the loop. Saguaro West is also beautiful. Wasson Peak hike for advanced hikers is a must!!!,"July 12, 2018",Great place,2,"Tucson, Arizona",5

Saguaro National Park,"I'm glad I went, but this park is definitely not one of my favorite National Parks. We only visited the West Park and spent several hours there. I have read several reviews of people visiting both the East and West sides over the course of two days. Honestly after spending several hours in the West Park, we had no desire to see the east side. A few things I was surprised about:1) there was no cold bottled water for sale in the Visitors Center. There was a fountain to refill your water bottles though. I point this out as I don't think I've ever seen a National Park without beverages for sale. We were kind of counting on being able to buy cold water as we literally drove from the Phoenix airport straight to this park (couldn't check into our rental property until much later). Once we got there and realized we couldn't buy cold water, we dug through our suitcases for our refillable bottles to fill them up with warm water from the fountain. Not ideal.2) The film at the Visitors Center was not at all what I was expecting. It focused completely on what the Native Americans think about Saguaros (people come from Saguaros, etc). I would have instead enjoyed a film helping us learn about the various cacti we would see in the park.As others have mentioned, the road in the West Park is not paved. I was very glad we were driving a vehicle that was high off the ground. I don't think I would have felt comfortable driving a low to the ground vehicle.","July 11, 2018",Review of West Park only,26,"Bolingbrook, Illinois, United States",3
Saguaro National Park,"I'm stunned that there aren't more reviews for Saguaro National Park. Even for visitors who don't have much time to spend in the park can have an amazing experience. The drive through the park is scenic, especially if you go after a big rain and the cacti are in bloom. The whole desert comes alive. I was lucky enough to have good timing and I got to see many flowers I've never seen before. The sunset is spectacular, especially with the iconic, old saguaro silhouetted by the vibrant colors.The stars in that night sky are mesmerizing and numerous. Truly a wonderful national park.","July 10, 2018",Nothing like this desert sunset,39,"Houston, Texas",5

Both areas protectthousands of acres of Sonora Desert flora and fauna including large stands of Saguaro Cactus. Both areas have small visitor centers, picnic areas, hiking trails, horse trails, interpretive signs and programs and roads open to both bicyclists and cars. Bust most of all they offer visitors beautiful vistas and trails where you can immerse yourself in nature.

Unfortunately both sides have bicyclists, who, for the most part, are very yielding to car traffic, some not so much. My husband is a cyclist, so I understand why these areas are great for bicycling, but when groups of bicyclists take over an area, they take up a majority of the area, not allowing for tourists and others to enjoy the picnic areas, trails, parking spots. Be that as it may, the park is gorgeous and would encourage everyone to check it out.","July 7, 2018",Beautiful park.,19,Keizer,5

We went in May just as the Saguaro began blooming, truly beautiful.Once in the park go to the visitor's center and pay your access fee. You could easily ""steal"" your way into the park and onto the hikes as there are no ticket checkers or gates barring your access to roads and trails. This beauty is only sustainable with the small charge you pay, essentially 5 dollars a person, or free or active duty military. Despite being active duty myself, I paid the entrance fee, its worth it!!Once inside I strongly recommend doing the Sweetwater Preserve or Black Rock Loop trails. They are both rated as moderate difficulty on alltrails.com and can be negotiated fairly easily. None of the trails in this park offer refuge from the sun so bring more water than you think you'll need and apply plenty of sunscreen. Best part of this trail is that you'll reach an altitude where you can look out over the entire park and see the sunset.

I feel it has a nicer visitor's center and higher concentration of Saguaros. Both sides of the park have scenic drives and a variety of hiking trails. I witnessed a spectacular sunset in the west park. Also of note, the saguaros bloom flowers in May and June. The flowers bloom overnight and close up by noon the next day. It is a pretty cool thing to witness. The park closes at sunset (the east has a gate that closes, the west does not), and there are no camping facilities in the park.

Both parks have their own outstanding features. the west has many, many more Saguaro, but the east has healthier looking Saguaro. We read on one of the many information plaques that a frost went through the east side in the 30's and 60's causing some of the Saguaro to die. To me they looked healthier on the east side, and larger around. The west side has the dirt road loop which we drove around just fine in our car, just drive slow and enjoy the scenery.

It is beautiful though to see the huge saguaro cacti and the many other species of desert plants.

There are so many saguaros in this park! Amazing to see all the different sizes and so many ways that the arms grow and curve. We hiked in the Tucson Mountain west district. The hike was easy-moderate and around 3 miles. There were tons of saguaros to admire and picnic tables to enjoy our lunch at. (Kings Canyon, cross over to Gould Mine, then back on Kings) Great time!

The west side drive is unpaved. On the west side did the Desert Discovery Trail, the Signal Hill Trail to the petroglyphs and the Valley View Overlook Trail which was beautiful.

He did a few short hikes on both sides of the part. In the west we hiked about two hours on the Hugh Norris trail plus we hiked Valley View and Signal Hill. All three were nice. Next time we'll try to hike a lot further on the Hugh Norris trail. It is moderately steep and scenic with lots of cacti and views. In the East we hiked Mica View, part of Cactus Garden, and part of Squeeze Pen. These were all pretty short and flat hikes because we had limited time. Saw some really big cacti! Next time we'll try for a longer hike and try to get up into the higher elevation areas. We saw quite a few hawks and other birds while in the park, plus a pretty long gopher snake, maybe four feet long.

It only gets a little high for the last portion so it is very doable. For most of it, you are in a valley between two mountains. Just sit on the passenger side of the tram going up and switch to the driver's side going down if you are really nervous. There are also several stops where you can get off and wait for the tram to come back down to pick you up. But really, you can do it! ","April 7, 2018","Love it!

The loop around the entire park is fantastic takes about a half an hour. Particularly nice is the Mica View Trail and picnic area. They have a paved part that is good for anyone who is in a wheelchair or with a walker. It will also cross into other trails that can be more challenging.

Saguaro National Park,"I don't to just repeat was everyone has already said. Here is my opinion. I took my sons to both parts of the park and they are in fact an hour drive away from each other. I believe that although just parts of the same desert, they offer somewhat different experience. If it is too hot for you to walk much or you are just not the hiking type, East side might be the right place for you. No hiking necessary to get the best of it without going far from the paved road. I found the views there to be even more mindblowing than the West. The west side has no pavement, but offers some hiking that was very appropriate for my 6y.o. and 13y.o. It also has the petroglyphs, but beware of the school trips you might run into.

The saguaro cactus, for which it gets it’s name, is exclusive to the area and is indeed the sentinel of the Desert. I found the quiet Desert captivating and the thousands of cacti that cover the hills mesmerizing. The visitors center is a must stop with good information about the fauna within the park and a short but pleasant nature trail thru the lovely landscape.

I suggest at least putting a pass in your car window or bringing it along.)Driving to the western unit from Tucson, over Gates Pass, feels like suddenly leaving the city and transitioning into a remote place. (You can get almost the same feeling by entering from the north, off I-10, or the south, off Ajo Way.)

They both have Visitor Centers that explain the region preserved and it's history, You can drive through both of them but they are best enjoyed by hiking into the higher elevations. My favorite routes are the Tanque Verde Ridge in the East Unit and the Sweetwater Trail or King Trails to Wasson Peak in the West Unit. Wasson Peak is my favorite spot as it has a 360 degree view.

Saguaro National Park,"During my recent visit to Tuscon, I visited Saguaro National Park twice. The first time via bicycle and the second via car. Both visits offered different perspectives but I would highly recommend visiting the park on a bicycle. We were able to appreciate the park at our own pace while enjoying the terrain and views not available via car. The main road is 8 miles from start to finish with some different and challenging elevation changes. There are points along the road that allow for cars to pullover to appreciate the vast views the park offers. However, it’s only when you ride a bicycle through that you are able to stop at points along the park that traveling by car wouldn’t allow. The most important aspect of this park is it’s location and the need to stay hydrated. Thankfully, they have a station at the visitor center to refill your canteens or water bottles for this adventure. Even by car, two of us consumed a total of a liter of water. My recommendation is to make it a point to stop and break at every dedicated lookout to digest the landscape and read the history presented.","March 17, 2018",Appreciation of nature ,22,"Pine Beach, New Jersey",5

We did 3 of the shorter hikes. None were too difficult, and all provided nice vistas. The only negative would be the minimal parking space at a couple of the trail beginnings.

The 5-mile loop road inside the park isn't paved but is in very good condition. Several pull-offs with parking and trailheads can be found all along the road, with hikes ranging from an easy 1/4-miler to as long as you'd like.

The Visitor Center also features a short 20 minute film which we both found quite interesting. The Center also offers a place to fill up your water bottle and use their very clean restrooms. They also have a short paved path which features many variety of cacti along with other types of plants and also gives a short description of each species. They also have what is called a ""javelina wash"" which is hard to describe but nonetheless is very interesting. Once back in the car you will find several places to pull off along with trails so one can do a little discovering on your own. They also have a beautiful 1/4 mile paved path which takes you among a huge variety of cacti. The park itself is fairly huge and oh so peaceful!!

Saguaro National Park,"Arizona is peppered with sites of natural beauty, so by comparison with some others, the Saguaro National Park west of Tucson is but a modest entry. However, if one happens to be in Tucson, and wants to get a feel for the desert, its mountainous upthrusts, and its bristling plants, then the Park, some 16 miles north west of the city, is a perfect place to do so. Bare mountains and mountains dotted with saguaro cactuses, especially well displayed along the Cactus Forest Drive; various desert plants in shades of green and grey, spiky and dry; some paved roads, others dirt and gravel, notably the Bajada Loop Drive, well worth the bumpy ride, especially if one has not sampled the Apache Trail (Rte 88); trails for hardy souls, evocative of the pioneers. Note, especially for hikers, that the desert is not a kindly place. It is, as is said, a clear and present danger. At a minimum, one has to carry plentiful water. One may happen on a wild animal, including a rattlesnake. Outside of a car, care is essential. Be cautious, be awed, enjoy!","March 8, 2018","Cactus, my love",37,"Seattle, Washington",4

Saguaro National Park,"Saguaro National Park may not be the most spectacular national park, but if you like high desert country and cacti, this is perfect for you. I really enjoyed the trails, vegetation, and general scenery. I wish the park had more land in both the Eastern and western sections.

Saguaro National Park,"First, I am a senior and my wife and I enjoy visiting national parks using our Senior Pass. But even for free, this park is one of the very few national parks I have visited that I would recommend against visiting. I'm sure the people are nice, and the rangers inside were very helpful. But there is nothing really to see in the park that you don't see along the road almost all the way out to the park. But the kicker is that the five mile driving loop that they have in the park is not paved. It is VERY slow going, and very rough. After we realized that there was nothing really new to see, the loop seemed even longer as we waited for it to end.","February 12, 2018",Don't bother.

Saguaro National Park,This is really a great National Park in that it isn't so vast that you can't see it all. There are two parts and this park is separated by the city of Tucson. We visited the eastern portion which is set up to be driven in a loop. There are places to stop and look and the view or to get out and hike on designated trails. Stop at the visitors center and plan out what you want to do based on your available time but this is an area where you can spend under an hour just driving the loop to the whole day hiking and sightseeing.,"February 12, 2018",Beautiful Desert Environment,69,"Malibu, California",4
Saguaro National Park,This was a wonderful place for landscape photography and wildlife viewing. The weather was perfect topping out in the low 80's over the day in February. Access is easy from Tucson which is a wonderful place to stay. I strongly recommend going to both the East Park and West Park. The West portion is much easier to get to and has more features but the East Park has such a perfect layout of desert flora that it looks like a planted desert garden. After walking a mile along the Mica trail I realized it could not be planted because they wouldn't plant such a large area. It is simply perfect naturally. The loop drive goes through this perfect landscape for those with mobility issues.

Saguaro National Park,"I always want to give a NP a five star, just because the site warrants preservation. This park is a bit difficult because of the two separate parks. And, it was a matter of preserving the Saguaro Forest that was the impetus for the park in 1933. But, Tucson is a lovely city, I give it that, but it takes about an hour to get from one side to the other. Our vote goes to the west side as the prettiest so if you have to pick do that one first, or if it is the only one you can get to. The hiking is great and the scenery is wonderful.

Very knowledgeable about the cats and the park.. how it formed, how and why cacti grow there and all about the Saguaro cactus.. weight, ages, propagating seeds, and nesting birds. Fascinating, kids would be bored as usual.The 2nd time was a disappointment. The visitor center is smallish, with some exhibits. Then, we went to see the film. We have seen park films at Gettysburg, Tetons.. all over this country. They usually explain animals, plants, formations... something. But here.. oh no.. you have to see a politically based film on why it is important to preserve the land, narrated by native Americans (I assume) and flute music. Awful! I want to learn something, not hear once again how we must preserve... blah blah blah. I have to save the park is beautiful but, the visitor center is a water of time.

Saguaro National Park,"During our visit to Tucson we had already spent time in Sabino Canyon, but we were so close to Saguaro National Park that we decided to drive through here also to see what it had to offer. We stopped at the Tucson Mountain District on our way back to Phoenix. We typically love National Parks so this one was on our list of parks to visit too. There was a brief US government shutdown in progress when we were there, so we were able to visit without paying the entrance fee. (We are too young for the Golden Age Pass, but I cannot wait until I am 62 years old to be able to get the pass!) In our opinion, though this was a nice park to visit and lots of saguaro cactus to view, my wife and I enjoyed Sabino Canyon a little bit better. We were a bit surprised to see unpaved gravel roads through much of this park. If hiking is an activity you like to do there are a good amount of trails through Saguaro National Park to traverse.

Saguaro National Park,"When we have visitors, Saguaro National Park (East) is always on the list of places to go. It never fails to mesmerize those visitors, and always offers something new for frequent visitors as well. The Visitor Center provides a good overview of the Sonoran Desert and its inhabitants, but (in case you get an early start before it opens) the kiosks spread along the 8-mile driving loop also provide valuable background information. Depictions and descriptions of desert wildlife and varieties of cactus will help you identify examples as you drive on. Make it a point to stop at each and every kiosk or pullout, for there will not only be information but also a fantastic vista awaiting you. The vista changes from desert to mountains, to ravine, to rock formations. Many of the parking pullouts are trailheads for good desert hiking; get a map from the ranger at the entry booth. One trail is handicap accessible and paved.Allot plenty of time, 3 or 4 hours. Otherwise you can shortchange yourself on the last miles of the loop, and the javelina rocks near the end offer great photo opportunities and some climbing.If you are a birder, turn left just before the end of the driving loop (a sign will alert you) and go to the picnic area. Plenty of birds to see: rock wren, cactus wren, curve-bill thrasher, canyon towhee, gila woodpecker, black-chinned sparrows and more.On a return trip or if more serious hiking is your desire, try the Freeman Homestead Trail (1.1 mile loop; halfway to the picnic area, with some good birding as you traverse a wash are) or the Tanque Verde Ridge Trail (8 mile in and out; more rigorous and to higher elevation, but you can turn around any time).","January 22, 2018",Saguaro National Park: always a great experience,12,"Tucson, United States",5

Saguaro National Park,"I have wanted to visit here for decades, and finally got the chance. Be advised: the park is split into an east side and a west side, with Tucson in between. I visited the west side: Tucson Mountain District. Took the road over Gates Pass into the west park entrance. Absolutely beautiful! (Now, I live in Colorado, so saying scenery is beautiful is a big deal, because, you know, Colorado! :). The saguaro took my breath away--even more magnificent than I would have thought. The fact that it's a saguaro forest has to be seen to be believed. The other plant and animal life just adds to the drama and beauty. I LOVE the teddy bear cholla. We are over 60 and out of shape, so true hiking wasn't part of our adventure, but I took a couple of the trails, including the little nature walk behind the visitors' center. The Valley View Overlook Trail takes you through some saguaro, cholla, prickly pear, and gently rolling slopes to a grand view overlooking the valley. On the way to the top, there's a particularly good view of saguaro as the slopes descend toward the valley floor. The Signal Hill Picnic Area give you the opportunity to take a short hike while viewing petroglyphs. Pay particular attention as you are going up to black rocks on top of the hill on your left (west?). There are LOTS of petroglyphs for such a small area. If you like desert vegetation, this place is paradise! We were here in January--temperatures were in the mid-50s to the upper 60s. Perfect :)","January 22, 2018",Breathtaking!,5,,5

We stopped to see the petroglyphs at Signal Hill. That is a little stop with a tiny hike. There are restrooms there, but it wasn't open. The cacti are so fun to look at with all the variations! If you don't get a chance to hear this (we learned at the Sonora Desert Museum) if the arms are facing downward, they froze at some point. They are 80% water and the arms can't recover and turn back up if they suffer from temps that dip too low. Like someone else said, you could possibly skip paying the $15, but we wanted to do our part top support the NPs. The movie was great to watch to learn more about the desert landscape. Overall, not like Zion, Bryce or Yellowstone, but so great that this park exists to be able to see this beautiful environment and have it preserved!

We toured the eastern portion via a horseback ride, and the western portion via a drive (in a low-slung sedan) on the bumpy-gravel-but-still-passable loop that took us right into the forest of Suguaro cacti that give the park its name. The western visitor's center was one of the more innovative ones in its display of plant and animal life of the Sonora Desert. We felt no need to spend more time than we did, but the time we did spend (two-hour horseback ride and two-hour visitor center and loop drive) was well worth it. We also recommend coming off the loop and going north to take in the northern part of the western section of the park.

Saguaro National Park,"We visited the Western Saguaro National Park today and arrived to some out of control male Ranger yelling at people in their cars in the visitor center parking lot. Apparently, some Contractors had set off the fire alarm and the Ranger thought it would be helpful to yell at everyone to make sure that when the small fire truck eventually arrived, it would have a clear path into the visitor center to clear the fault. In the process of threatening people to get out of their cars and to stand under the flag pole, he decided to walk over to our car to yell at my wife, who because of an injury, was slower than normal in exiting the car. Fortunately, the Ranger got distracted and went to a different car to have his temper tantrum with some other visitor who apparently told him where to shove it. That was very fortunate for this guy, as my wife would not have taken too kindly to his bad temper either. Sorry, whoever this Ranger is, he needs to handle emergencies in a calm manner and probably needs to retire.

Saguaro National Park,"This National Park is special and totally unique...particularly the Western Section of it where there are so many Saguaros of all sizes and their other cacti cousins. The desert landscape there is just gorgeous...almost other-worldly. You only see Saguaros in a very very limited area of the Sonoran Desert. Some of them resemble giant humanoid figures and tower over 15 to 40' and some over 7’ or more around each clustered clump.You will also see many different animals and rodents if you spend time and keep an eye open...particularly in the morning and evening. Sunset looking west through the Saguaro Forests to the mountains beyond is to die for. This is a photographers dream, particularly in the late afternoon as the light angles lengthen and light up the Cacti and landscape with an extra golden glow.","December 31, 2017",Superb!

We went in December and the weather on that particular day was cool (45 degrees) and off-and-on rainy, so much so that we didn't go to the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum (just outside of the park), of which 75% of it is outside. Besides the saguaros, the expansive views are amazing and you must hike! By hiking on a trail, you can fully experience this amazing area. You will have just a short trail hike (5 minutes) by walking up to see the petroglyphs. I was enamored by this area and want to go again! Note that compared to Sabino Canyon, the Tucson Mountain District (West) is much more scenic and the terrain is mostly flat so that you are level with the saguaros.","December 30, 2017",Don't miss experiencing this unique environment,35,"Longmont, Colorado",5

Saguaro National Park,"I loved Saguaro National Park because it was out of the city and wasn’t crowded at all! We explored the west side of the park. There are two sides and the city of Tucson sits in between them (they are about an hour apart). We first went to the visitor center and paid our entrance fee. Although I’m sure many people completely pass over this and enter without paying, we wanted a couple souvenirs from inside and also paid when in there. It is $15 per car. We drove the 5 mile loop road and were able to pull off where ever we wanted. The road (dirt, a little bumpy) is one way for half the way so make sure you enter from Hohokam Road. We then turned left onto Golden Gate Road. Off of Golden Gate Rd we turned off to the right to Signal Hill Rd. Signal Hill trail is one of the most popular spots because you can hike up and see ancient petroglyphs from A.D. 200-1450. The hike is .25 mile round trip. Very easy “hike” and large parking area as well as picnic spots. I love national parks so there isn’t a National Park I would skip, if you are in the area... make sure you visit!! You will feel like you are in the middle of the desert without a city in reach... yet you are so close to Tucson! ","December 11, 2017",Great escape ,47,"Seattle, Washington",4

The walking paths were easy and marked well, but don't stray off them....some of he cacti grow pretty close together and it's rattlesnake country.

Saguaro National Park,"This park is in two parts. The city of Tucson is situated between them.Each portion of the park is smaller and not does not have as much infrastructure as your “typical” natural park. i.e. park stores, campgrounds, etc. The park is more about preservation of the area than making it user friendlyThe eastern portion had a driving loop and some nice short paved trails. There are placards to tell you what plant you are seeing. The Saguaro cactus are HUGE. We have all seen these in every western cartoon or advertisement. well, here they are. Do not touch ANYTHING! every single living thing in this park has about a zillion spines on it. wear decent real shoes if you are walking. The western portion which is adjacent to the Desert museum, has more dense cactus on western side, but they appear to be a bit smaller. Take a few minutes at each of the visitor centers to learn about why it is important to keep these areas protected. There is essentially no shade so bring water and a hat is a good idea.Nice driving loop that can be done in less than an hour. You can see a lot without even getting out of the air conditioned car if you prefer. Worth seeing if you are near the area.","November 8, 2017",interesting to see the iconic cactus of the west,156,"Highland, Indiana",4
Saguaro National Park,"I grew up in Arizona but left in 1996 when I was 20 for Army Basic Training; since 1999 I've made Seattle my home. My parents have a house in Tucson where they live during the winter, so I went to visit last November. Saguaro National Park was one of many parks and places to visit outdoors that I had never gone to, so I decided to check it out.To get there you leave the city on a two lane road that winds through foothill mountains outside of Tucson. There are houses along the way, but they are sporadic and not tract style subdivision homes, so you dont feel like you are in the suburbs along the route. The national park is on the north side of the road when you get to the top of a low elevation mountain pass that gives a spectacular view of the valley below on the other side. The parking lot is not huge, which is good because it does not have a lot of room for dumb tourists with their smart phones. If you go, anytime during the winter months is good since the weather is pleasant. If it is warm out, be mindful of reptiles like snakes; they like to sun themselves on the rocks. Summer though is a different story since it gets very hot in the Sonoran Desert. Best time to visit in the summer is during the early morning hours before noon. There are plenty of hiking opportunities here, so wear some good trail hiking boots. Take plenty of water and again be mindful of the snakes since they come out during the early morning and early evening hours when it is cooler. If you are lucky, you may see coyotes or javalinas (which resemble wild pigs or boars, but technically are not). If you have a camera, certainly bring it. A good DSLR is perfect, but please leave the damn smart phone in your pocket. And dont tell your friends and family about this place, keep it coveted by the Trip Advisor community. This is the Sonoran Desert, and it is absolutely beautiful here. When you think of deserts, nothing you've read will do this park will accurately describe the park and surrounding area. To truly appreciate it, you'd have to visit in person. Please do not litter or toss cigarette butts in the desert either.","November 8, 2017",Beautiful Somoran Desert attraction with fewer crowds,12,"Seattle, Washington",5

One was a 2 mile hike with a great variety of cacti called the Mesa Picnic area hike. Really nice hike.The other hike was down into a little canyon with some really tall saguaros. Very cool also. That hike was about a mile and fairly easy although it did involve some steps down and then back up during the loop.

The park is easy to reach - whether east or west of the city - and presents a breath-taking array of forms, features, heights, from tiny budding under-a-decade-old newbies to towering, forty-foot high double centenarians. Of course, they're accompanied by the full host of other varieties of cacti and other desert plants. Take the walk to Signal Hill and gaze past the petroglyphs across miles of saguaro, a horizon of mountains, long hot valleys.

Saguaro National Park,"I did a road bike ride around the mountain range that encompassed this national park starting from the Tucson Estates area. Just north of TE on Kinney Road, there is a park visitor center were you can buy a day pass. Now there are a couple roads that transition through the park...if you're just using one of these roads, you don't have to pay. If you plan on stopping at any of the paved parking areas by the trailheads and hike, you'll need to pay. Since I was just passing through on my bike ride...no charge. Now the visitor center has a gift shop, restroom facilities, and some educational information and displays. There's also a really great view of the Saguaros at this location. I even think there are a couple trailheads here if you're interested in taking in a hike and closers look at the cacti. Plenty of paved parking. If you're just passing through...this place is kinda cool...stop in and check it out!Being mid-October, the temps are usually in the mid 80s...but on the day I chose to ride, the temperature soared to 96! Although I had plenty of water, I overheated because I pushed a little too hard. It took everything I had to make the Gates Pass Rd summit and back to TE. I rode CW which has a more gradual grade.

Saguaro National Park,We found out about this National Park after driving to Tucson to see the boneyard of airplanes. When that fell through we went to Saguaro National Park. The only downside was the gift shop. Everything was so expensive that we could only buy postcards. This is what you find in all the National park gift shops. You would think they could make things more affordable for families to pick up a t-shirt or a cute memento to bring back. We took a 3 week trip and went to several National Parks and all the gift shops were priced over the top. That's a shame because that makes it bad for the parents with several children. I would suggest skipping gift shops if you have children.We walked around the visitors center and enjoyed seeing all the names of the different cactus.

So, what you do is to go to both. We really didn't have the time, but we did it anyway. The east side is very scenic and well worth the drive. The west side really shows off the very impressive forrest of Saguaro trees. In addition, a short hike will take you to some petroglyphs.
