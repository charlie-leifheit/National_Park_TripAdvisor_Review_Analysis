Pinnacles National Park,"Went with my husband for a day trip and we thought Pinnacles was stunning!! We did the Condor Gulch - High Peaks Loop which took about 4 hours with a stop for a picnic. We saw really cool caves, got some elevation, squeezed through tight passes, and looked at some amazing rock formations.

Pinnacles National Park,"We stayed for three nights in our hired RV; the only down side of the camp ground were the toilet and shower facilities which require an upgrade plus the level of cleanliness requires attention.Pinnacles is a beautiful National Park on a wonderfully small scale; we enjoyed long hikes and picnics and, being the low season, we were fortunate to meet very few other people on the trails. How the last reviewer saw it all in half a day I can’t imagine.The condors are magnificent, what a success story. I had wrongly thought I’d seen them previously but they were buzzards; once actually in the Pinnacles, at elevation, we were fortunate to spot two or three condors in flight and/or resting on the rock face.Fantastic place but my tip would be to go in late September when it’s not crowded.","October 8, 2019",Tranquil and stunning,3,"Cornwall, United Kingdom",4
Pinnacles National Park,"There were some interesting things to see at Pinnacles but it falls short in my mind of what I consider a national park. We visted the east side of the park and saw everything that was of interest to us in half a day. The pinnacles and the cave were the highlights but it didn't have that awe-inspiring feeling that I typically get when I visit other national parks. We did see about 10 California condors during our visit however they were all hanging out in fields along the road as we entered the park and not flying which I would have liked to see.The park is remote and requires driving through a isolated landscape. The drive isn't bad but I didn't find it particularly scenic either and the admission price seems kind of absurd relative to what other parks charge and offer.We stopped on our way back from visiting Sequoia/Kings Canyon so it wasn't too far out of the way. I wouldn't suggest anyone make a special trip to see this park though because it just doesn't have the ""WOW"" factor I would expect.","October 6, 2019",Not My Idea of A National Park,112,"Freeport, Pennsylvania",3
Pinnacles National Park,"This park seems like a part time park. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. The rangers and staff are extremely helpful and very little traffic when we were there. We hiked the Bear Gulch Cave trail to the reservoir. The caves were fun, but being 6', 250lbs, and old, there were a few tight spots and I had to remove my backpack only twice! Be sure to bring a flashlight as it was very dark in a few places. When you exit the final staircase there is a beautiful reservoir. We also hiked a bit of the Old Pinnacles trail but didn't like it so we returned to our car.","September 4, 2019",Newest NP,5,"California, Kentucky",4
Pinnacles National Park,"First off, this park is really remote. There is almost nothing around it, and it takes a while to get to either the East or West entrance. The drive around the park on either side is pretty, but short, nothing spectacular compared to the other National Parks we have been to.If you like to hike, this park is for you. There are all kinds of options with different destinations to see and snap. For us, we tried one hike, but with the temperatures hovering in the 100 degree range, we abandoned it early on.","September 4, 2019","Not my favorite park...but if you like to hike, its worth it",45,"Las Vegas, Nevada",3

Pinnacles National Park,"We traveled to this park during the week in August. We got a Google alert that the visitor's ctr was closed but we did not anticipate this to be a problem. When I say the drive was harrowing, I am not joking. We were the only ones on the road for well over an hour, past huge farms, oil rigs, no signs of civilization. Also no cell service whatsoever. The road to the park is winding, and in many spots one lane. I traveled with my two adult sons and I was feeling that it was a mistake given the remote feel. When we finally arrived at the park, we were the only ones there! Maybe it is just the city girl in me but this was a big red flag. We used the bathrooms reluctantly because no one really wanted to get out of the car. We did not hike although it looked great. I am writing this review just so that you know what you are getting into. I was very uncomfortable being so isolated and with no cell service. I have not idea what you would do if you had an emergency of any kind. We did pass a winery at some point so I guess you could walk there if absolutely necessary. FYI, it would have been $30 to enter the park if someone was at the gate, but I guess the visitor center being closed meant no staff at all so if we stayed it would have been free. But to be honest, you could not pay me to stay in such a remote location with no one around.","August 15, 2019",Gives new meaning to remote,11,"Fairfield, Connecticut",3
Pinnacles National Park,Beautiful National Park. Rangers at the Visitors Center were very helpful. We made the one hour hike through Bear Gulch and really liked the caves. Highly recommend a visit.,"August 8, 2019",Great experience,9,,5
Pinnacles National Park,"First of all - this is in a remote area - so do NOT run out of gas - fill up your gas tank before you get here because there is nothing around here. Our family of adults hiked this easily - my elderly mother would have had difficulty; it is a moderate hike. We came in the east side - and drove up to the camp store (very nice) and then drove up to the visitor center (also nice - with bathrooms) - and then drove up again less than a mile to where the walk started (bathrooms!) - it is an easy walk to the beginning of the path from the visitor center, so you could just leave your car there. One person who could not hike with us stayed at the visitor center and rested in the shade. We loved the diversity - hiking through caves and then hiking up high and looking down over canyons. Worth a second trip! Saw very few people.","July 24, 2019",Very empty - great hike,21,"Andover, Massachusetts",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited Pinnacles NP for less than one hour due to other travel plans, however, we plan to return and spend at least a half-day there. Unusual formations and forested beauty are an oasis in the middle of farmlands of the Salinas Valley and adjacent.Rangers were very friendly and outgoing. None of the hectic pace of the larger national parks like Yosemite or Yellowstone or Volcanoes. Visitors seemed relaxed and were not rushing around. Good camping and picnic sites observed. Small but reasonably equipped park store.","July 22, 2019","Moderate hiking, caving and spectacular rock formations in an easygoing National Park environment",8,"Los Angeles, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles is one of the lesser national parks. It is rather remote, and pretty darn hot during the summer.That said, a “lesser” National park is far better than most other recreational places you might visit.The major event here is hiking. There are plenty of trails most of which lead to the pinnacles. The campgrounds are nice, and one of the campgrounds even has a swimming pool. There is a small camp store in the small visitors center. There is also a small nature center, but unfortunately in the summer it is only open on weekends.If you are not hiking, there are places to stay in Hollister which is about 45 minutes north of the park, and I’m sure plenty of other places, but none of them are very near the park entrance.","July 12, 2019",One of the lesser national parks ,119,"Roanoke, Virginia",4
Pinnacles National Park,"This is a great hike, requires a little scrambling in some places. We used the west side entrance which allows you to go to the peak and take the tunnel for a nice loop back down. Fairly strenous but worth it. As ypu head up from the west side, take the tunnel entrance when you see it about 2/3 of the way up and then after the peak follow the path for an easy descent back down. The bat caves are cool, a little overated, just check to see that they are open before you go. ","July 2, 2019",Fun Hike,8,"Pompano Beach, Florida",5
Pinnacles National Park,"This place has some beautiful rock formations and trails. I only did the trail to the balconies cave and some of the balcony cliffs. The caves are quite a workout and I would not take elderly people through it. It certainly scared my mother and she had some trouble getting through it, but she was fine afterwards. Climbing parts of the caves and getting down was quite a workout so be prepared. However, it was quite fun. Definitely come prepared and bring plenty water, snacks, and lunch. Also bring some flashlights and batteries as the caves are pitch black. Good hiking shoes are a plus. 30 dollars for admission at the gate so bring exact cash and a pen. Emergency supplies, sun block, hats, sunglasses, and first aid kit are a good idea too. Overall a good experience if you like to hike and exercise.","July 2, 2019",Unique park that was quite a workout,7,,4
Pinnacles National Park,We hiked in January when it wasn’t too hot. We went into the east side of the park which makes for a long drive. Stop and buy food/ drink before you get to the park as choices are very limited once there. We did an eight mile loop up to the Pinnacles which are fun to climb - like a scramble at parts- and there are railings at the scariest parts. Making to the top is probably too challenging for young children but they would enjoy the bat cave ( you need to check first to see if the bat caves are open),"July 1, 2019",Worthwhile hike,24,"Berkeley, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"On a trip to the Big Sur, found this park on Google Maps by accident. Took a gamble and glad we made that choice.Few notes:1. The “west” visitor center is closed on Fridays. Use the visitor center on the east side. This appears to be the main one.2. There are only 3 parking lots in the east side. We barely found a spot for our truck at 11am on a Friday 11am. So arrive early if you can.3. Carry lots of water. About 2 liters per person to be moderately comfortable. I managed with less than a liter but I also took in about a gallon before the hike.4. Wear light clothing, sunglasses, sunscreen, snug fitting hat (the wind can knock it off your head).5. If you’re planning on doing the High Peaks Trail between Scout Peak and Hawkins Peak, do NOT carry a large backpack. The trail can be extremely narrow.Time 12:00pmSo we started from the Bear Gulch parking lot after filling our water bottles and using the restrooms. There was an option of either the Condor Gulch Trail or the Moses Spring Trail. We did the latter.Time 12:10pm0.5 miles on this trail and ran into a marker post splitting into the High Peaks Trail to the right. The Reservoir/Caves part of the trail was 0.7 miles away and going on the High Peaks would be another 1.9 miles. We went with the shorter option.It’s easy to lose track of the trail due to numerous spur trails for rock climbing. Most of them are marked with a carabiner logo. The trail leading to the cave was closed but seemed like there was another trail to yet another cave. As mentioned above, lots of spur trails.Time 12:30pmFound Moses Spring and then made our way up narrow stairs with hand rails to the Bear Gulch Reservoir.Time 12:40pmSaw some water snake swimming. Easy up to this point with some minor elevation gains but mostly downhill. The stairs leading to the reservoir was where we gained most of the vertical losses. About 500-600 elevation gain to this point.If you try to go clockwise around the body of water, you’re going to run into climbing trails and onto the Chalone Peak Trail. This veers south and away from the rest of the park. Probably no condors in that direction. It was only 30 mins of walking so far with plenty of breaks.Time 12:56pmTook the 0.4 mile Rim Trail leading north. Planned on taking a right at the split which would get us back to the parking lot in 0.8 miles - probably all downhill. We got a good view of the “Monolith” boulder on this trail.At the split we latched on the 1.5 mile long High Peaks Trail instead of heading back. A gradual incline and some good resting spots. A long stretch in the brutal sun. The final part of this trail is littered with switchbacks until the very top.Time 1:50pmReached the top and rewarded with a bench and a restroom. Scout Peak is just south of here.Time 2:05pmAt the top, we had the option to take either Juniper Canyon Trail (0.6 mile) to Tunnel Trail (0.6 miles) or continue on the High Peaks Trail (0.7 mile). The condors are visible on the latter trail so we went with that. There were signs warning on upcoming “narrow” segments.Time 2:41pmFirst “narrow” segment. Crudely made narrow stairs on the side of the cliff with handrails for support. Followed by more slightly wider steps this time without rails. Followed by hand carved steps wide enough for one foot only but hand rail support which is needed.Time 2:49pmReached the top of the “High Peaks” section. Condors galore.Time 2:59pmHeading down still in the same clockwise direction. Crossed a deep ravine on a sturdy looking bridge but had to duck as the clearance was fairly low. Followed by a hand carved notches on a cliff wall wide enough for a single foot. Going downhill on that would’ve been impossible without the hand rails. If we had done the Juniper Canyon to Tunnel Trail route, we would’ve skipped all this and met at the bottom. Very easy all downhill since the scary notch steps.Time 3:37pmHit the split to Condor Gulch Trail which leads to the Bear Gulch parking lot. Continue on the trail and we would hit Bench Trail. Decided we saw what we came for (ie. condors) and took the 1.7 mile hike down.Time 3:55pmReached the Overlook Point which is halfway on the Condor Gulch Trail to the parking lot.Time 4:30pmGot to the Bear Gulch parking lot. Temperature was 92 degrees.Final Remarks:Total hike was 3.25 hours if we exclude the breaks along the way.","June 23, 2019",Surprisingly Good,17,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4
Pinnacles National Park,"We entered the park at the east entrance and stopped at the Visitor Center for trail information and a map. The ranger pointed us in the direction of a 2.2 mile loop trail using the Bear Gulch, Moses Spring and Rim trails that was really fun to hike! It was a gentle incline for the first half and a gentle decline for the second half. The trail was fun to follow, sometimes climbing over rocks and sometimes leading to small caves to explore. The midway point is a lovely reservoir that provided a nice spot to sit and rest and enjoy nature. The views along the trail were wonderful. This is also a great park for birdwatchers; we heard and saw several birds, and if we’d had time and energy we could have added a few miles to our hike to (possibly) see a California condor. I love that this park doesn’t have the crowds of other national parks, allowing visitors to enjoy nature with a measure of quiet along the trail. Even the drive to the park was worthwhile for the views! Definitely worth visiting. ","June 22, 2019",Fantastic hiking!,110,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Pinnacles National Park,Really unique experience to only be a few hours from Perth but in the desert with these amazing pinnacles. The kids loved running around the pinnacles.

Pinnacles National Park,"If you have some time to spend, this is a great park for doing some hiking. There are not a lot of visitors, so you can get plenty of “quite time” along the trails.

Pinnacles National Park,"Our family has been to several national parks, but this is the first time we've had the fun of scrambling up and down boulders, squeezing through tight places, and using headlamps to go through caves. It was a blast! The Bear Gulch Cave was closed, but luckily, the Balconies cave was open. Do not miss the caves when you visit; it's what makes this national park unique. Strongly recommend using a headlamp, leaving your hands free for scrambling. There are tricky areas where you'll want to have your hands free. Look out for white arrows painted on rocks so you know which way to go in the caves.We hiked the Moses Spring-Rim Trail from the Bear Gulch to the reservoir, and enjoyed cool views of rock formations along the way. Also hiked the Balconies trail from the Old Pinnacles Trailhead to the Balconies cave, and back via the Balconies Cliff Trail. If possible, go in the spring or early in the day! While the trails we hiked were not hard, it was HOT, especially on parts of the Balconies Cliff Trail!We camped at the Pinnacles campground. Bathrooms were clean, and the campground well kept. Enjoyed the pool during the hot afternoons! All the staff that helped us were very nice, especially one staff member who patiently exchanged my loose change for quarters for the shower. I brought plenty of change, but didn't realize the showers only accepted quarters! Definitely look at the campground map when choosing a site; some sites were close together, and some completely without shade.","June 5, 2019",What an unique national park!,40,"San Francisco, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,We did the east entrance first. Took rangers advice and did the Condor Gulch Trail up to overlook and back. Before getting halfway up 2 condors flew over us. Then we heard weird flutter and as turned another condor took flight over us. This was so awesome. We then did a loop starting with Rim Trail to beautiful little reservoir-so peaceful. Did return on the Moses Spring Trail-this had a lot of fun turns. This was amazing day. We also went in on the west side. Nice drive in and took short walk to caves and returned. The visitor center is currently closed at this entrance. Everyone should visit this park- it is awesome. ,"June 3, 2019",Loved it!!,26,"Mount Dora, Florida",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We are making our way to as many NPs as possible. This one was in route so it got added to the trip. We didn’t have a lot of expectations with little reviews on the trails on out trail app. However, it is gorgeous. GO EARLY!! When I say early, I recommend starting by 7-7:30. We went on May 29th and it was already hot. We did the Bear Gulch Reservoir. The cave was closed so you switching to the Moss Trail. It will get you to the reservoir. Just when you think you have lost the trail because it heads down through big rocks and small passages...you found the trail. It is not marked great. You should head off to the right through the rocks. You will hear the water so keep going. It will take you to the stairs. Those stairs are well worth it. The reservoir is right at the top. If you go early the light creates a great reflection off the rocks. Go up to the right (not back down the stairs). The trail will loop back around. The Old Pinnacles trail to the Balconies Cave is really nice and easy. Take water and snacks. Wear a hat and out on sunblock. ","May 30, 2019",Surprisingly impressive ,82,"Carbondale, Illinois",5

Pinnacles National Park,"We have visited this park several times, even before it was a national park. Since it’s designation as a NP, it has become extremely popular and very busy. If you are coming on a Saturday or Sunday, try to arrive by 9am at the latest, otherwise, you will sit in line waiting for a car to leave the park, allowing a car to enter. This can take forever and ruin your day, once we waited 2+ hours.We’ve done several hikes and really enjoyed all of them. I highly recommend coming in March, April or May when the hills are green and the wildflowers are abundant.While there aren’t many amenities in this park, it is a nice place to visit on a day trip from the Bay Area.

Pinnacles National Park,"We enjoy visiting the National Park units so we made a detour to explore this one while on our summer road trip. The park has two halves, the east side off CA25 and the west side off US101. There is no road that goes all the way through the park (over the Pinnacles) between the halves, and the two entrances are about 60 miles apart. After talking to a park ranger via phone, we decided to visit the west side of the park. We were traveling with a wheelchair and the ranger said the west side is more accessible, with a new visitor center and all-access trail. It is usually extremely hot at Pinnacles in the summer, but we were fortunate that the temperature was about 20 degrees cooler than normal. We drove in the 12 miles from Soledad to the end of the road at the Chaparral picnic area and trail head (entrance fee $30/car or NPS pass). This was a scenic drive on a narrow paved road that has some curvy sections and drop-offs; it might be a challenge for large RVs or trailers. There are several trails that leave from the Chaparral area, but none of these are suitable for wheelchairs. After enjoying the views from that location, we drove back to the visitor center. The facility was obviously new and features exhibits about the local geology and ecosystem. A small shop offers hiking necessities and souvenirs, and a restroom is provided. We were amused by the ground squirrels that were scampering everywhere around the building and parking lot. Behind the visitor center, we walked the gently-graded Prewett Point Trail to an overlook with good views of High Peaks and the Balconies Cliffs. The path is .7-mile long one-way with a compacted dirt surface. There were benches and educational signs along the way, but no shade so be prepared for sun exposure. We had to be cautious of grassy vegetation along the shoulders of the trail that appeared to have thorns. Note that leashed dogs are only allowed in the developed, paved areas- not on trails. This side of the park was quiet in August and we were the only ones on the trail. This is not a park that we would personally visit as a destination because there just isn't enough wheelchair accessibility to warrant it, but we were very glad we stopped by and spent a few hours there.","May 13, 2019",Relaxing Afternoon Walk,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",3
Pinnacles National Park,"Our second visit to Pinnacles; both were attempts to see the Condors. Successful this time. The park has rather good birding and nice trails but otherwise minimal amenities. There are some spectacular views, caves, and such for the hiker to access. This is a hiking park, with minimal road access. Also, there is but one campground and no wilderness camping. Weather is generally warm to hot so be prepared. This is a great place to actually be out in and experience the natural world.","May 12, 2019",Gem of a place,137,"Olympia, Washington",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We spent a few hours on the east side of the park. It is not connected to the west side. We did a short 2 mile hike into the namesake rocks (pinnacles). It was a fairly rugged but moderate walk. The unique part was entering a cave system with many steps up, a few tight squeezes (mind your head!), and some wet spots. The highlight were two small underground waterfalls. You should bring a good flashlight or the like as it is very dark. We drove about 45 minutes from King City on a very windy road. Warning: If you're not camping, the nearest lodging and gas are in King City. Fill your tank before you come if you're heading east to Sequoia National Park. It's three hours to the next gas station.","May 9, 2019","Small with minimal facilities, but unique",692,"Raleigh, North Carolina",4
Pinnacles National Park,"Small, but worthwhile! I came to hike the High Peaks trail and depending on your interest in visiting, be prepared for crowds, a $30 fee, but amazing views. High Peaks Trail: This is one of the most challenging trails I’ve done. Mostly because of steep terrain, my fear of heights, and footholds carved into the rock to climb on. It was a thigh burner, ass kicker, and not for the faint of heart. But the changing of scenery and the breathtaking views made it all worthwhile. I never once got bored and felt a sense of accomplishment when I finished. We did the trail clockwise and I’m glad we followed that advice. I’m not sure I would be able to go down the footholds in the rocks, going up seemed much easier. We watched the hikers who were going down and many were struggling. It is steep! Most of the trail is void of significant shade. I’m glad we we did it the beginning of May, started early, and the weather was pleasant. I couldn’t imagine doing it during summer months with little to no breeze to keep cool. It took us almost 6 hours, but that was after many rest stops during the more brutal inclines and stopping to enjoy the views. We saw many condors and admired their beauty. The ranger said some people can do it in 3 hours, but I’m not sure why you would want to. I feel like you would be missing out on a lot. Just a note: the caves were an added bonus, but a quick little jaunt through. I’m not sure I would visit just for that feature as it is short lived, but totally appreciated for anyone of any age. One of the best, most exciting trails I’ve done to date. A hike to remember!","May 7, 2019",Hiking,34,"Manteca, California",5

Well marked and maintained trails. Deer, squirrels, fox, hares and of course plenty of Condors.Creeks were running in higher elevations, Dry creek beds down low.

Pinnacles National Park,"Nicknamed the People’s Park, Pinnacles National Park is the result of hard work and dedication on the part of the people who were instrumental in designating this park first as a National Monument, and then as as National Park. A two hour drive (normal traffic conditions), from the Bay Area, this park boasts of faults, volcanoes, and caves as a consequence of erosion. This park is also considered home to several California Critters, most important of them being California Condor. The park has some great views along Condor Gulch-High Peaks and Chalone Peak trails. A great hike followed by rest and picnic style lunch by serene waters of Bear Gulch Reservoir would not be the worst idea.

Pinnacles National Park,"We were there off season, so pretty much had the place to ourselves. Came in the East Entrance and parked at the furthest parking lot to take the High Peaks Trail up. We loved every step of this trail, but it can be strenuous. Just before the trail meets up with the Tunnel Trail we had the opportunity to see several condors (not to be confused with turkey vultures that are also around). We came back via the Condor Gulch Trail. This trail was very boring by comparison. It is unfortunate that there is a spot marked ""Overlook"" on the Condor Gulch Trail that attracts many visitors to take this trail - it's nothing to see. Take the High Peaks Trail for great sights.","April 28, 2019",Loved the High Peaks Trail,14,"Denver, Colorado",4
Pinnacles National Park,"The best way is starting at Bear Gulch trail just across the parking lot. The nice views are from the beginning, if you walk beyond 1.6 miles you can get a little more difficult path: narrow and steep; requires more effort since you have to climb stone steps to the higher rocks. We saw few condors there.In your way down is a rustic bathroom ladies.","April 24, 2019",Impressive views,5,,5
Pinnacles National Park,"While Pinnacles National Park is small in size, it is big when it comes to interesting features and considerably better than what we had expected. While rock climbing of the shear Pinnacles attracts the hardcore adventurers to this park, the many interesting hikes, with a broad range difficulties and lengths, are a primary attraction for most. Certainly one the best that is not too long at 2.2 miles (3.5k) roundtrip or difficult is the Moses Spring to Rim Trail loop that takes one to the beautiful Bear Gulch Reservoir and, even better, through the talus cave known as Bear Gulch Cave. Talus caves, a rather unique feature of Pinnacles, are caves formed by boulders falling into a narrow canyon creating a roof with cave like passages through the debris.Another great feature of the park is the rich flora and fauna, especially the great diversity of birds that can be seen. During our visit, some of the birds we saw included the noisy Steller jays, wild turkeys, hummingbirds, turkey vultures, a golden eagle, bald eagle, the interesting acorn woodpecker which drills holes in the bark of trees then finds an acorn just the right size to force into the hole just drilled; not interested in the acorn itself, it returns and eats the insects that grow in its acorn farm. While we did not see any, others reported seeing falcons as well. However, the star is the rare California condor, the largest flying bird in North America. With under 300 in the wild (and about another 170 in captivity), Pinnacles National Park has the highest concentration as is probably the best place most will have the chance to see one in the wild. At the advice of one of the rangers, we hiked the Condor Gulch Trail to the observation point, about a mile (1.6k) each way, and this portion is not too difficult as it climbs towards the high peaks, and we were lucky enough to see several condors as well as many of the previously mentioned birds.This small park has become very popular and the limited parking spaces often fill by 10am on the weekend and potentially any day during the peak months of March and April when the weather is best and the talus caves are generally not closed to protect the bat colonies. Once the parking lots are full, rangers only allow additional cars to enter as others leave. If you hope to park in the Bear Gulch area of the park, the most popular area, plan to arrive even earlier or you will likely need to park at the visitor center and take the free shuttle to Bear Gulch.","April 21, 2019",Caves and Condors,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

Soaring condors, crazy cool rock formations, stairways in the rocks and tunnels through ledges. And so quiet! I didn’t see another human in four and a half hours! A buddy might be a good idea, for that reason. But really great fun and great stuff. So well maintained!","March 20, 2019",High Peaks Trail is awesome!,7,"Lloyd Harbor, NY",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles NP is one of the smallest and newest national parks. I started my driving from Merced, which took 2 hours. There is no toll station unlike other NPs, but you still have to buy entrance ticket. You can get it from the visitors center. $30 per vehicle. Also, note that there is no cell or internet service throughout the park and along some portion of the highway.One option is park your vehicle at the visitors center and walk along the trail to Bear Gulch. Or you can drive up to Bear Gulch area and park your vehicle there. I drove up to Bear Gulch. There are some parking spaces, but when I was there, only two of them were available. I did the hike to reservoir via Bear Gulch Cave. The cave is not always open, so you may want to talk to ranger to check if you can get into the cave. The water level of the cave was low, but there are no paved pathways. This means that you may get your shoes wet if you lose balance while stepping on some of the stones which are not fully submerged. I went through the cave, and continued until I reached reservoir. The view of the pinnacles were awesome. I definitely recommend trying this trail, unless you are not disabled or having problems regarding walking steep slopes. From the reservoir, I made a turn to the rim trail. I think the rim trail is good for overlooking the NP. It took me about 30 mins to return to Bear Gulch parking lot. Upon arrival, I had my snacks, and went on another trail, Condor Overlook.Condor Overlook is much easier than the trail via Bear Gulch Cave, in my opinion. I walked until the overlook and spotted some condors and vultures. The view was also very nice. I spent about 40 mins round trip.Pinnacles NP is a small park, but there are less people too. I would recommend people to visit and I want to visit again once Balcony cave is open again.","March 13, 2019",Small and new NP,394,"Los Angeles, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"My wife and I have a goal of seeing as many National Parks as possible. We had target Pinnacles as we'd not been there before. After touring parts of California we tried to learn if Pinnacles was open or not. With no one answering the phone and the Web site not updated, we took a chance and headed there only to find a CLOSED sign. But, as we pondered our next steps a woman who worked at the Concession stand drove up and asked about our situation. After explaining things she said ""follow me"" and in when went. She then helped us get a campsite for two nights. Although there were no Park Rangers, there were Camp Hosts. The park was less than 25% full. During our stay there we took several great hikes, enjoyed the wildlife of deer, quail, and turkeys, but no Condor sightings.","February 21, 2019","Got in when it was ""closed"" due to Government Shutdown",6,"Spring, Texas",5

We waited a good 45 minutes to get a spot. We first hiked to the Bear Gulch Reservoir, which easily was the highlight of this trip. We spent over an hour in the water and then moved up. The walk through the caves was also interesting and we could get some nice photos. Photos from top of the peak were also one of the best I ever captured.Make sure to arrive at the park early to avoid waiting in line for parking.

Pinnacles National Park,"I have around 40 years of experience with landscape photography, starting with a high degree of fervor in 1984 in South Carolina (swamps), in 1988 in Hawaii (waterfalls), 1992 for California coastline (tafoni) and Oregon coastline, 2014 for southern California deserts (30 visits to date at Joshua Tree National Park, 8 visits Death Valley), and several visits in the years 2017 and 2018 at Pinnacles National Park. The years 1994 to 2004 were not used much for landscapes, because in that time-frame I'd switched to photos of infants, toddlers, and birthday parties with kids up to age ten. Anyway, whenever I encounter a new landscape, I spend a year scouting out the territory with my 35 mm lens camera, trying different angles, different seasons, and different times of the day. Then, I switch to my 4 X 5 field camera, and I take exhibit-quality photographs, where my prints are up to 3 feet by 4 feet. Regarding Pinnacles, I have discovered that my best photos, so far, are taken with a 300mm telephoto lens from Condor Gulch Trail and from the upper third of High Peaks Trail. From Condor Gulch Trail, you can point the lens to the weird hand and finger-like stone formations to the west, and acquire really striking photos that, perhaps, are a bit scary (see, attached photos). Then, you can continue climbing to the intersection with High Peaks Trail and continue on up for ten more minutes, and set up your telephoto lens so that it points northwards. Here, you get pictures of classical beauty, that is, beautiful in the same way that a David Muench photographs are beautiful. Please see my photos from High Peaks Trail, which provide a bird's eye view of the distant stone fin-structures on the slopes of the nearby mountain peak about a quarter mile to the north. Most people take close-ups of the granite monoliths, and of course, my attached photos also include close-ups of these monoliths. As I stated above, I've visited Joshua Tree National Park about 30 times, with both my 4 X 5 camera and 35 mm camera. Joshua Tree is highly relevant to Pinnacles, for the following reason. As we know, Pinnacles National Park originated from volcanic granite in southern California near Lancaster, CA. But plate tectonics, brought the volcanic granite formations in the vicinity of Soledad, CA. You do not have to be a geologist, to immediately recognize that the orange-colored granite monoliths at Pinnacles looks a great deal like some of the orange-colored granite monoliths at Joshua Tree. I think that a photographer who loves either Joshua Tree or Pinnacles, will be a better-rounded photographer if she or he has photographed granite formations in both parks. What I also enjoy at Pinnacles, is arriving at six o'clock in the morning, and driving slowly over the entrance road, and watching the rabbits scampering here and there.","December 22, 2018","Unusual photos taken with 300mm lens, resulted in me visiting three times in March 2018",349,"Berkeley, California",5

Pinnacles National Park,"We are four Canadians ranging in age from 54 to 64 who visited Pinnacles nearly two weeks ago (Nov. 20). We drove in separately to our AirBnB accommodation at Passagno Winery, which suited us very well in terms of space, location and amenities; my husband and I came in from Santa Cruz via Moss Landing, while our friends drove from SF airport. We accessed the park from the west entrance; on this day, the contact centre was closed, but the bathrooms were open. Be prepared with your exact $25 cash as there are envelopes for depositing your car-access payment, but nobody to make change. The road is seemed brand new, so the drive was smooth. Bring your own water; we hiked on a cloudless day in 70 degrees, and sweated a fair bit into our packs! I drink a lot of water normally, and on this day drank 2 litres over the 15 kilometre, 1500 foot elevation gain hike (Balconies/Cave). It helps to have someone with a good sense of direction, as the sign posts and intersecting trails are not always clear. We carried in a picnic lunch of tortillas, prosciutto, sliced Monterey Jack cheese, and salsa, along with grapes and mixed nuts; except for the nuts, we purchased all water and food at a Hispanic grocery in Gonzales. We wore hiking clothes, brimmed hats, and hiking boots, which we appreciated. We had small head lamps for the caves (great to be hands-free!), and also binoculars which were a boon. Saw a condor, and fantastic views on the not-crowded hike. A few people were very surprised we had found tis gem of a park!","November 29, 2018",Great way to spend a day,19,calgary,5

Pinnacles National Park,"A national park for serious walkers. We spent a few hours in this, relatively, small national park. Having spent a week in Yellowstone just before going to the Pinnacles it was quite nice to see a park with only a few people there. The emphasis here is on walking and some of the walks are quite strenuous. We took advice on entering the park as we had limited time and set out on the walk we had been recommended. Unfortunately, the information we were given was not accurate and we ended up heading off on the wrong trail. Having said that we climbed high, had aching calf muscles and got the spectacular views so it was worth it. Some signage higher up on the trails would have helped; the ones that show up saying ‘You are here’.

Pinnacles National Park,"Amazing hikes, which is why we're giving this a 4 rating. Enter park from East side for camping. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can enter from the West and still camp. West entrance is for day hikes and climbers only. Note: If you enter from West for a day hike, plan on an early arrival to take it all in. You'll be far away from the East trails and Bear Gulch.Trails are excellent and very safe for all abilities. Don't attempt High Peak if you're not in shape or severely overweight or with kids under 3. Same with the caves, it's just too tight in many places. Drive up to parking off peak and weekdays. Take shuttle on weekends. Best hike is Bear Gulch through caves up to reservoir. 1.5 hours from parking, again on East Side.As for camping. The sites are great, but they have about 5 to 8 sites blocked because of Oak trees losing limbs. Not really sure why they can't trim the dead limbs and make trees healthy. Losing revenue and aggravating visitors.The reservation system is a mess. The check in gal was going off of 3 different spreadsheets. Sites marked open were not open and camp host is not on top of marking the reserved sites. Noticed many ""reserved"" sites open all weekend, so clearly don't have a handle on reservations. We arrived on Thursday, moved on Friday, and were able to stay through the weekend. No reservations but this was for mid October.Overall great trip. Highly recommend the Park and for those who don't have an RV and want to camp in comfort, there is a company that delivers RV rentals there. No driving or towing required. They deliver and set up.

Pinnacles National Park,"Don’t let my negative comments away you from attempting this hiking trail. The good far outweighs the bad here. Pinnacles is a drive to get to. There is an East and West entrance which do not meet in the park. If you want to see the iconic pinnacles topper up close - that is the East entrance. But there are still stunning and breathtaking views to be had on the West side plus Gulch Caves which is the trail I did. The trail itself is what I would call a 2.5 out of 5. The initial stretch is all uphill with some large boulders to climb over requiring pretty agile feet. Then there are the caves, flashlight required. The return path back to the tiny 6-spot parking lot was more precarious than the approach. Would I do it again? Yes! It was fun, challenging and beautiful. Tips: bring water, wear sunscreen and bug spray, proper shoes. Pack a picnic - plenty of spaces to eat within the park. There are little to no food options depending on when you visit. Take your time. If someone is walking faster then let them go around. Finally, though dogs are welcome in the general park they are not permitted on trails.

Pinnacles National Park,"I was on a week-long sister & brother road trip / vacation and Pinnacles was one of our planned places to visit. We arrived around 5 p.m. and the Visitor Center was just closing. But this was no deterrent for us as we wanted to do one of these short hikes to take in the scenery and experience the park.We wanted to do a relatively short hike so we chose the balconies Cliff-Cave Loop trail which is 2.4 miles round trip. You get the best of both worlds on this Trail as you get to go up the balconies Trail to see the spectacular views of the rock formations and then back down into the cave Part of the trail. You must have a flashlight to go in the cave as it's not lint. By the time we got to the cave part of the trail the sun was already setting and I was a little nervous to enter but it was totally fine. You do have to scramble over rocks and small boulders but the Cave Trail is marked. We saw a couple bats on the cave ceilings and many flying at the mouth of the cave, probably because we were there at dusk. By the time we exited the Cave the sky was Pitch Black and the stars were just spectacular! Once you leave the Cave, the trail is relatively flat back to the parking area. All in all a very nice trail with interesting things to see.","September 12, 2018",Beautiful scenery!,2,,5
Pinnacles National Park,"We parked at the visitor center on the east side and had a makeshift lunch from the campers market. Options are limited but there is enough variety to figure something out if you don’t have other options. We came in on 198 W and 25 N. We didn’t pass any other options. The ranger told us the round trip hike to the Balconies Cave was 5.3 miles and that there is water in the Chaparral Parking Area. This is true but bear in mind that round trip from the eastern trailhead to water fountain is actually 7 miles. We weren’t aware of this when we started and probably would not have ventured on the hike if we had known. That being said, despite the heat, it is a beautiful hike with a lot of great geology. The talus cave was pretty cool. No pun intended (it was noticeably cooler inside). We saw some birds and reptiles. (No snakes but they are probably there). We noticed more animal activity after the daytime temperature peak started to drop. A bit of advice for everyone. Make sure you have plenty of water if you venture on this hike during the summer. My husband and I drank 6 liters on the hike with a bit left over. The hike probably took us around 3 hours. Also, yellow jackets congregate any place where there is a water crossing on the trail and at the water fountain. There are a few puddles near the cave.","August 29, 2018",Hot but Beautiful Hike,123,CT,5
Pinnacles National Park,"We did the west entrance because we had limited time to see the park. We loved the Balconies cave hike -- gorgeous scenery on the way out and the cave walk as the highlight. The ranger recommended that we take the route left (up the hill) to access the cave from the ""back"" and this was a great decision. There is a steep spot near the end of the main cave that is easier to traverse going up than down. We went early in the morning so it was cooler even in the full sun. We saw lots of scat, but no animals or condors. We ended up hiking by ourselves the whole way, but met up with a large group on our way out. We noticed they were using their cell phone ""flashlights."" This is a hike where we would strongly recommend you bring a real flashlight for the power and reach -- the interior of the cave is very dark and you need to see where you are stepping and climbing. Be aware that inside the cave is a rock scramble not a stroll. The 2.4 mile hike took us almost exactly the 1.5 hours stated at the visitor's center. However, we stopped frequently to take photos and took our time in the caves. Well worth taking the time while we were in the area for a wedding.","August 28, 2018",Don't miss the cave hike!,107,Highlands Ranch,5

It was a good moderate hike but it was very hot in the early afternoon so we took lots of water breaks. The views were awesome. The trail was well marked. We especially liked the cave since we got the chance to climb over rocks but yes.... you definitely needed a flashlight. I tried taking a video and it turned off my flashlight and I couldn't see a thing! Lucky we didn't drop our phones either!! Bring lots of water, a flashlight and good hiking shoes.

We told her we understand but we already paid the previous day and the campsite should be reserved under our name and we should be able to bring our stuff. She keep saying check in 1pm. I said we should be able to go to our site we paid for it and it's not like a hotel that the site needed cleaning. She said you can go if it's not occupied. I told her if we paid for it why would it be occupied. She grab my paper and took my reservation#. Then rudely said read the rules and sign in. No apologies.

It took us only 2 hours, but we were completely cooked by the end, it was so hot. I met people with little kids who hiked this from the East side (that would make it a 5mile loop), but I guess they are more used to the heat.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles was a National Monument for over 100 years and became a National Park only about 5 years ago. It is a small park, but has awesome rock formations that can be seen on very nice hikes through canyon trails that lead you up to very beautiful vista views. You could hike for a fews hours or all day depending on your interest. We thought the rock formations were outstanding, but we also loved seeing all the bird species, especially the California condor which soared over us. There is limited parking, which is free, but we came on a week day and there was no problem. On the weekend there might be an issue with parking. It was warm since we came in June, but there was lots of shade on the hiking trails. Make sure you have enough water on your hike. The entrance fee is $25, but it's free if you have a senior park pass. Because of the rock formations in the canyons, the light at sunrise or sunset might be very beautiful hitting the walls, but we were there in the mid-mourning to early afternoon.","July 8, 2018",Beautiful hike among the rock cliffs,26,Plano,5

I was able to get a great parking spot and get on the trail quickly before it got too hot. Everyone along the trail was very nice and I was interested in seeing one of the California condors, which I was able to do as it flew over. I was also fortunate in seeing many lizards, snakes, turkeys and many different bird species on my hike of the high peaks trail and also the balconies cave loop. This is a park not to be missed if you are traveling up the 101 and can take a few hours out of your day.

Pinnacles National Park,"I love the National Park System, and make a point to visit any site I can—I’ve been to over 60 NPS stops, and Pinnacles is my 10th National Park. This is the only time I can say that I’ve been truly disappointed. For something with National Park status, this place is really underwhelming. Dumpy visitor center with little educational material, tacky swimming pool, expensive entry fee, inadequate parking, and limited options for hiking. The drive in is windy and not scenic, and there is no road connecting both sides of the park. Summer is unbearably hot, which would be fine if the caves weren’t closed or if there was anything worth seeing without miles of hiking uphill on exposed trail. I love that our park system preserves a variety of sites (some of which are not conventionally beautiful), but National Park designation for this place just doesn’t make sense to me. A National Park should have better infrastructure, recreational opportunities, and educational materials for visitors; this should have stayed a National monument. Not worth the trip.

Pinnacles National Park,"As a great fan of U.S. National Parks it has to be said that, judging from the area accessed from the Western entry only, this is the first time I have felt disappointed by any of the dozen or so NP’s we have visited.It is different from other NP’s in that driving does not really provide much of an option. From the western entry station you can drive just three miles or so to the Chaparral picnic area which offers access to a number of hiking routes to suit a range of abilities, but that’s about it.It’s a truly beautiful spot and undoubtedly offers access to a great outdoor activity facility but beyond that...does this really justify NP status?In my opinion...sadly ‘no’. It’s certainly a beautiful and remote place but so are many other places in the U.S. On the day we went - a weekday towards the end of June - it was virtually deserted...so deserted in fact that the pay stations and centre were all locked up and unattended. That saved us $25 as there was literally no where to pay which, for the first time ever when visiting a National Park, we considered quite a good thing. Perhaps the eastern side has more to offer.","June 26, 2018",Don’t expect Yosemite or King’s Canyon.,223,"Ashbourne, United Kingdom",3

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National Park is a gem of central California. It is the place of strength and tranquility. A zigzag of the trail leads to an incredible surreal view of serene stone statues. The dramatic stone giants, sculpted by nature, rise and stand in silent glory. It looks like wizards captured people and animals into these monoliths millions of years ago. Some stone formations seem to resist the laws of gravity, ready to fall apart any moment. Deep narrow gorges formed caves where bats are whispering strange stories. On a hot day, hikers like to cool off in the cave too. The inspiring California condors are lazily circling in the bright blue sky, putting on an ariel acrobatics show. The wind brings a sacred Indian melody of the eternal. The sunset adds drama to the rocky landscape. People rarely meet on the trail so you feel like you are on a rendezvous with nature, where you can open heart and mind, enjoying the serenity. Pinnacles National Park is the spectacular place where I want to return again and again. ","June 13, 2018",Excellent place,16,"Kaiserslautern, Germany",5

It was approximately 5.6 miles and a lot of fun.Fair warning: my weather report indicated a high of 82 degrees, in reality it was 95.

Pinnacles National Park,"There are two sides to the park with no through road connecting the two sections. I had visited briefly with my father years earlier and don't remember well, but it was probably the west side and I feel the trails were easier there. The west side is a short distance off Highway 101, the east takes you through a beautiful section of back country San Benito County. This trip we only visited the east side which has the only Visitor Center. While I am very glad that I did the Bear Gulch cave, it was much harder than I remember of the caves on the west side. Two memorable parts were where the trail was flooded and we had to use stepping Stones and brace against the cave wall and in another section, crawling through a triangular space about two feet high for about fifteen feet. At the end is a nice view of a reservoir. I took another trail back. While we didn't do another trail, it often allows views of Condors. While I did the hike, my wife waited at the Nature Center near Bear Gulch and watched the video a number of times.","June 1, 2018","Hard Cave Hike, Glad I Did",183,"Los Angeles, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"My friends and I hiked a ~9.5 mile loop, which included bear gulch, the caves, and the rock stairs. It was a varied and really interesting hike, one of my favorite hikes so far in California. The landscape is beautiful. It was moderately crowded, especially at choke points around the rock stairs and caves, but not bad. Part of the hike was a moderate uphill hike that left us tired (in a good way), and the second half of the loop after the caves was almost totally flat--which we wanted after 5 miles of more challenging hiking.The caves themselves are not incredibly long. We were inside for approximately 10 minutes. They were well worth it, though--the rock formations were gorgeous and the rock scramble really fun.Definitely bring flashlights if you're doing the caves. We thought we would use our phone lights, but the ranger told us they wouldn't work. We ended up buying flashlights.","May 27, 2018",Wonderful day hike to caves,21,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We had hoped to hike Pinnacles on our way down to Paso Robles, but we got caught up doing other things in the morning and arrived at Pinnacles a little late for a good hike. We drove in from the EAST side and entered via the Visitor Center on that side. The center is a little shack shared with the camping store and gift store. Not the classiest of visitor centers, but trust me, I've seen alot worse! We parked at the Bear Gulch lot and were able to get out of the car and wander about...it was no hike, but it was something! We were also able to visit the Nature Center which had some cool displays and a video about the Pinnacles formation.","May 27, 2018",Interesting Formations,122,"Camarillo, California",3
Pinnacles National Park,"We spent two nights camping in the East side of the park. We weren't able to hike the Bear Gulch trail as planned, it's closed until mid July to protect baby bats in the cave. Hiking and bird watching are the major activities. The days were a bit cool when the wind was blowing, warm when it stopped and cold at night. The camp ground is okay but bathrooms are few and far apart. One of the two toilets was clogged in the women's restroom the whole time we were there, which I read about in someone else's reviews a few weeks before. The restroom was a bit rusty with wet floors. The pool looked nice, but my boyfriend said it was cold with a lot of bugs and stuff. On Saturday it was full of kids, Sunday, hardly any kids. We were in the RV part of the camp ground which was an open field with some big Oak trees, very open. For tent campers, sites 49 into the 60's are mostly small, but very shady and private, upper sites 60's - 70's aren't bad but back up to a steep hill. We enjoyed watching the wild life, condors, other birds, squirrels, rabbits and raccoons. The visitors center was basically a small gift shop. In all, we had a good time, but it's not at the same level as other national parks I've been to.","May 23, 2018",nice little get away,18,"Fremont, California",3
Pinnacles National Park,"First, a disclaimer: There are many places on the web and in guidebooks where you can read what this park has to offer. I'm not going to waste your time here describing the park's features, trails, etc. I'm going to assume you've already read-up on all that, and just want to read a reasoned and informed opinion about it all. So here we go:1. First and most important, this being a National Park, the scenery. The rock formations are intriguing and beautiful, especially near sunrise and sunset, and the setting - California's Mediterranean-type oak and chaparral country - is almost unique in the national park system. A hike at Pinnacles's High Peaks is unlike any other in the system. Now, the caveats.2. Views from the ""frontcountry"" (ie the roads, trailheads, and anywhere within a couple hundred yards thereof) are vastly better on the West side. Views from frontcountry on the East side are forgettable. If you're going to be staying near your car, head to the West side and skip the East side entirely.3. The backcountry offers excellent views as well, but be prepared for mostly-strenuous hiking to get there. Best hikes for scenery are the Balconies trail and the High Peaks trail. Again the West side is better, because it offers quicker access to both and good scenery the whole way. East side access to these features is longer, with more elevation gain, and less scenery until you get further in. (When I say ""scenery"", I'm talking about dramatic views of the pinnacle rocks.)4. This park is grueling hot in the summer, cold (by lowland California standards) in the winter, and most pleasant weather-wise in fall and spring. Spring is the green, growing season in California. Autumn is sere and brown. If you don't like the brown of the California dry season, go only in the spring.5. But spring weekends are packed - on both West and East sides. If you do go in the spring, go on a weekday. That said, somewhat fewer people visit the West side (interestingly since all the better views and access are on that side, as noted) and so crowds are slightly better there.6. Facilities are better, once again, on the West side than on the East. A modern, well-situated and attractive visitor center is on the West side, and the Chaparral trailhead area on the West side has been renovated (the ramshackle ranger station and outbuildings have been removed). The East side, by comparison, has the worst visitor center I have ever experienced at any unit of the national park system. It is really just one-half of a camp store, at the campground, with no exhibits. If visiting the East side, skip this visitor center if possible (you may have to stop in anyway, to pay your fee) in favor of the Bear Gulch Nature Center, a suitably-historic CCC structure further in, with a few exhibits and an orientation video.7. Speaking of the campground and its facilities: camp sites are diverse and generally good. Some are secluded, others are close together; some are shady, others are open. Head for the back for shade and better seclusion. Camp *site* amenities are good (fire pit, locker, table, easy access to water and level ground for your tent, all in generally good condition). In contrast though, camp *ground* facilities are shabby and dilapidated, especially the aforementioned camp store and ""visitor center"". The swimming pool out back with its chain-link fence is an eyesore, and the nearby showers are filthy and rusty (one of only two male showers was out of service when I visited). Overall the campground facilities are much more reminiscent of a county park or low-end private campground.8. In summary: Visit the West side. Skip the East side, and skip camping here, unless you must (eg access for sunrise and early-morning hikes - there is nowhere else close to spend the night near the East side, and the West side is day-use only and does not open until well after sunrise).9. A final word about the moniker, ""National Park"": this park is small and only barely meets National Park Service guidelines for what a ""National Park"" should be: an area of multiple, significant, distinctive and diverse natural, historic, scientific and/or scenic resources, in a landscape-scale setting. The pinnacle rocks and the talus caves meet the bar, and the Meditteranean-type ecosystem setting is nearly unique in the park system; but the park's small size means that the previous designation of ""National Monument"" was overall more appropriate. Pinnacles' upgrade to a ""National Park"" was, at the end of the day, driven by local political and economic boosterism - ie ""grade inflation"" to drive tourism.Overall rating: I love all nature, and I love the national park system. Five stars for the natural experience as seen and accessed on the West side. Minus one star for the ramshackle East side ""visitor center"" and campground facilities, and for the spring weekend crowds.","April 21, 2018",Should have remained a National Monument,30,"San Jose, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited the East side of the park on a Tuesday, so there is no crowd. I lived in SF Bay Area for over 20 years and never been to this place and was pleasantly surprised how nice this place is. We liked it so much, we went back on Thursday to the West side entrance. Highly recommended. If you have to choose between going to East or West side, go to the East side. Also, go on a nice sunny day, your pictures will come out like postcards.The hike to the Bear Gulch reservoir is relatively easy. Just one place where you have to crouch down in the cave. On the west side, the balconies cave hike is not exactly easy, but not hard either. Best to go clockwise via balconies cliffs trail then into balconies cave. This way, you are going mostly uphill inside the balconies cave where you have to climb a lot of rocks.","April 21, 2018",Surprisingly Nice National Park,42,"San Jose, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I've been stopping at the Pinnacles for years and it just never gets boring. It is a fantastic stop for those traveling up or down California. The Pinnacles are accessible both from the East and West with the East entrance having a campground and a visitors center. It can be especially rewarding in the summer months as the wind from the coast comes through the rocks on top of the ridge and is quite something to behold. The loop trail can be accomplished in about 5-6 hours and is well worth the effort.If you plan to stay more than one day then camping at the park is an excellent option. The campground is run by a third party but best to make reservations through the recreation dot gov website. There is no restaurant at the park or even nearby so plan ahead. Most of the campsites have a grill and a fire ring and the general store does sell some food items.The Pinnacles is home to the restored population of the California Condor and my daughter and I got a great look at one when we were just there.Magical rocks, fascinating geology and superb hiking trails make this a place I will come back to again and again.","April 20, 2018",Amazing grace,27,North of San Francisco,5
Pinnacles National Park,"I just got back from 3 days on the East side of Pinnacle National Park with my hiking friends. We stayed in the campgrounds with tents. The facilities are stark but adequate. The bathrooms are flush toilets but there is no electricity. There are lots of wildlife to be seen from birds, raccoons, frogs, bunnies and of course squirrels. There is a camp store but is small & very limited. Our first full day we hiked the Condor Gulch Trail which is 1.6 straight up. Make sure this trail is done early since it can get hot. We spotted 2 Condors on this trail. Thanks to a local Ranger on the trail all our Condor questions were answered. We then took the Bench trail down the other side of the mountain. It was shady with a breeze & full of beautiful wildflowers . A nice loop hike. On day three we did a short hike to the Bear Gulch Caves. It was amazing!

The visitor center staff and folks operating the shuttle buses were all courteous and informative. The drive to get there is very nice as well with lots of greenery especially in the spring season after some rains.The reason I am taking off one star is that the place has become very crowded and needs improvements to handle all the people that seem to visit now. For example, the restrooms weren't in great shape and we had to wait 15 minutes just to park our car. I suppose designating Pinnacles as a national park has put it on many folks' bucket list, but, the facilities haven't been upgraded to the extent required to handle all the additional traffic. We visited Pinnacles about 9 years back while it was still a national monument and there weren't very many people in the park and along the trails then.","March 25, 2018","Wonderful place, but getting very crowded!",5,"San Ramon, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"Although it rained off and on for the entire 3 days my husband and I stayed at Pinnacles NP, we really enjoyed our stay. It is in a remote area without cell signal, but that is part of its charm. We hiked the Bear Gulch trail, hiked through the Bear Gulch Cave and on to the Rim Trail, and hiked the flat unmaintained South Wilderness Trail. All were great, although getting through the cave was challenging at points because of low ceilings and narrow walls, along with puddles due to the rain. Lots of birds to see and hear, including condors. Wild turkeys near the campground and several deer. Quiet, beautiful area with oak trees and ferns. Cold in March - got down to the 30's at night. We were happy that we had electrical hook ups for our trailer so that we could run the heat now and then. No generators are allowed in the campground (a plus for us!). It was also quiet at night. Restrooms were clean and basic. We found out we could have paid $10 at the Visitor Center to have wifi for one phone (or tablet, etc.) while we were there.

We found a Red-shouldered Hawk on a nest. After driving to the end of the road, we hiked the Condor Gulch Trail. Four condors came down the canyon, giving us great views.

Pinnacles National Park,"We stayed in Salinas, about 45 minutes away and did shorter loop hikes in the two mornings, then went to the beach in Carmel in the afternoon.For spectacular panorama views we started our first loop at Chaparral parking and went up Juniper to the junction with High Peaks and turned left to head to Tunnel. Wow! What fun! The section of High Peaks between Juniper to Tunnel actually has steps chiseled into the rocks in some places and hand rails. The Missus has some acrophobia, but the rails gave her plenty of confidence on some of the narrow dodgy exposures. Doing this loop counterclockwise enables you to do most of the steps going up, rather than going down, which seems more comfortable.We were hoping to see condors, but it seems the morning of a winter day doesn't provide the thermals to get them out.The second loop also started from Chaparral lot. We went out Balconies and then turned left to go up on the Cliff Trail. It was nice on a cold winter morning to be up in the sun. The Cliff trail offered a spectacular vista over the narrow valley. We then descended down to the Cave trail. The cave REQUIRES a good flashlight, and preferably a headlamp so your hands are free to scramble. You will need to scramble and do a lot of ducking to get through, but it is WELL worth it! It's like a slot canyon that got covered with huge boulders to form an irregular roof. There is a creek through much of the cave, so if it's recently rained you're likely to get your feet wet.","February 27, 2018",Did two short loops from the west entrance,334,"Houston, Texas",5

A high intensity head lamp would be ideal, but you can get by with a good flashlight. And when you come out of the staircase, it’s a pleasant stroll in the daylight with a few boulders to duck beneath before you make it to open space. Then there’s a little climb up the Balcony Cliffs trail where you’ll see some intrepid rope climbers making their way up the cliffs, and you’ll come back to the cave entrance, from where you can take an easy stroll back to the parking lot.

Pinnacles National Park,"Our mistake to visit on a Saturday in the fall. The park is small, has very little parking and completely inadequate shuttle services. We arrived mid morning, and all parking beyond the tiny east entrance visitor station/campground was full. They had only 1 small and 1 medium-sized shuttle bus, so we waited well over an hour to ride the shuttle the 3 or so miles to Bear Gulch. If not for our small children, we would have walked it, although that part is very non-scenic.Lower Bear Gulch Cave was open during our visit, and the loop trail through the cave and up to the reservoir was interesting and just challenging enough, but was do-able even with 3 small kids. In the afternoon, there seemed to be more rangers at Bear Gulch and the Visitors center. All of them were wearing kevlar vests and police utility belts with sidearms as well as nonlethal weapons. Not sure if this is the norm at this park, or if something unusual was going on, but I found it strangely menacing, and unusual for a national park.Overall it was a worthwhile trip, but would have been better if it hadn’t been quite so crowded and under-equipped for the number of visitors.

The Eastern side is the 'main' entrance with a visitor center, campground, shuttle, and store. Most of the trailheads are in this part. We hiked the High Peaks/Condor Gulch Loop -about 5 miles -which takes you aloof the high peaks ridge line and was simply amazing and other worldly in parts. Steep in parts but quite doable by a couple of fairly fit 60+'s. Along the way we saw two tarantulas -a first for us! The western side includes the Balconies Cave, one of two talus caves in the park -created by boulders wedging into ravines and a blast to hike -flashlights are a must! We hiked this late in the day, and loved it... It is on the strenuous side, at least for we non-caverns. We walked back to our car in the moonlight, dodging bats the whole way This is NOT a park meant to drive through -you will not truly get any feel for the park unless you hike it, but if you are willing to do a 5 mile loop, you'll have an amazingly different perspective of volcanic geology.","October 30, 2017",Amazing Laid Back National Park,113,"Edgewater, Maryland",5

Pinnacles National Park,"We were on a California National Park trip and since Pinnacles was a NP, we decided to see it. We knew very little about the park before going. We just knew it was a bit out of the way and little traveled. It was a pleasant surprise.We toured the west side a few miles from Soledad. Apparently this side is less trafficked than the east side. That was fine with us. There actually weren't many people. Our first stop was at the Visitor Center (or as they call it, The West Side Visitor Contact Station. What a name!). Nice little Visitor Center. Viewed the video. Good introduction to the Park.We decided to hike the Balcony Trail and go through the Balcony Cave (not actually a 'real' cave but a talus cave). The hike was quite nice winding back into the hills. The 'cave' is spectacular. Strange to understand that it is created by big boulders. In places it is quite dark and a challenge to get through. Great experience.On the way back to the Center, we took our time looking at the rugged peaks. The rocks are suitable for rock climbing. We saw several groups roped up and climbing some of the larger faces.All in all, a very nice visit. And better than we anticipated.","October 10, 2017",Surprisingly Enjoyable,323,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",4
Pinnacles National Park,"We entered the park from the wast entrance. It was a short drive from Soledad, CA to the entrance gate and the visitors center. The short information video was worth viewing. The road into the park from the west ended after 2 miles, so the only thing left to do was get out and hike the Balconies Cave Trail. Visiting in October means the creek bed was dry, which was good since the trail ends up following the creek into the cave. I did not attempt to make the entire loop as the cave became a challenge after a short distance, we turned around and departed in the same direction we came in. It was a short and interesting visit, but not worth spending a lot of time in the park unless you really enjoy long hikes through the hills and dry meadows.","October 9, 2017",Balconies Cave,42,"Bettendorf, Iowa",4

Pinnacles National Park,"We came to the east side of Pinnacles on a beautiful Sunday morning. It was a bit chilly when we arrived but would be very hot by the time we left. The visitors center does not open until 9:30, so planning ahead is very useful. We hiked to the Lower Bear Gulch Caves and then around the Rim Trail. It was a fun hike- a bit sunny but not too difficult. Then we did the Condor Trail. That was definitely challenging, particularly since we were in the full heat by that time. We stopped at the overlook and went back down. There was a decent crowd in the afternoon but overall it was very quiet without much traffic on the trails.","September 30, 2017","Wonderful, quiet park",92,"Alpharetta, Georgia",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Just past the visitor check station, you’ll come to the Chaparral trail head parking. This trail head is well appointed with a picnic area and restrooms. From here you can pick up the Balconies Cave trail or the Juniper Canyon trail which will lead you East toward the center of the park. We arrived early in the morning to avoid the heat and potential crowds (July 4th). We started with a hike to the High Peaks trail before the temperatures got too hot. High Peaks is a strenuous trail with some steep, exposed sections, including “stairs” carved into the side of the rock with iron railings. We chose to follow a clockwise, 4.3 mile loop from Juniper Canyon > Tunnel > High Peak > Juniper Canyon. Switchbacks help you navigate up & down the 1200 ft elevation gain. Tunnel trail required a very steep climb up the “steps”, which are more like footholds carved into the rock. This area is very exposed and will challenge anyone with a fear of heights, however there are hand rails in place to provide assistance. Once we reached the peaks, it was fun to walk through the rock formations and the view was fantastic. This is also a great place to watch for California condors, although we were not lucky enough to see any. Descending the High Peak trail requires going down more “stairs” before joining back up with the Juniper Canyon trail to return to the trail head. Everything we read told us to take the counter clockwise path through this loop, probably to avoid having to climb up the steep Tunnel trail. However, for safety reasons, we decided that it was better to climb up the “stairs” in the steepest section, rather than down. After returning to the trail head, we enjoyed a picnic lunch before finishing the day with the Balconies Cave trail.","September 7, 2017",Pinnacles National Park: High Peaks Trail (from W entrance),179,Ohio,5

Pinnacles National Park," Thoroughly enjoyed this day hike, as well as the drive to down the unexpectedly rural Highway 25. Purchased the lifetime pass at the well appointed gift and snack shop at the entry area. Affordable camp and trailer sites, very scenic grounds for the sedate, the young, and the resting restless.  Searing hot above, signs advise 1 liter per hour. Took a northern trail from the Eastern approach, 2 miles seemed like lots more. The altitude is not so high, the physical condition not to toned these days! Have to work on that. These volcanic igneous intrusions have marched 200 miles from an extinct volcano the other side of the San Andreas fault. Wore down a mile in the process. Large jumbled boulders, caves within. A person training or conditioning could move on the various trails, and in the space of 2-3- or 4 weeks could know this place well, love it, and be a bit tougher.  Chatted a bit with small groups of 2 or 3. Travel more quietly and see more wildlife. One chatty group voiced not seeing condors, which were everywhere.

We found a hike to Bear Gulch Cave and the Reservoir which was about 2.5 miles and not very difficult. It was very scenic with pinnacles, caves, rocks and rangers training to retrieve injured climbers from the rocks.

Pinnacles National Park,"My friend and I stopped at Pinnacles National Park while southbound on Hwy 101. It's about a half-hour drive from Soledad on State Hwy 146. The road is well-kept but fairly winding, so be prepared for alert driving through somewhat rough country.Once at the park, we stopped at the Visitors' Center. The ranger was very friendly and helpful, giving us tips for driving further into the park; you can't travel all the way across; our road in from the west would not connect with the eastern entrance to the park, off State Hwy 25 (near San Benito). He also invited us to a screening of the park's video about conservation efforts to bring back the giant Californian condor, which has been pretty successful; they currently manage 86 wild condors. The Center also has a bookstore and--my favorite--a kiosk where you can get your National Parks Passport stamped.The park itself is pretty primitive; the rock spires are beautiful but, unless you want to do some hiking, you won't see much from your car. Unfortunately, we didn't allot that much time for our visit, so we weren't able to get out and really enjoy the park as much as we could have. There is a campground in the park, with a camp store, so we certainly could have extended our time there.If you're a fan of desert landscapes, and hiking through them, Pinnacles is definitely worth a visit. Try to allot a full afternoon just for the hiking, or plan to stay overnight in the campground.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National Park is a new park -2013. There is a campground with a swimming pool and a small ranger station/mini-mart. Then there are hiking trails. Most of moderate difficulty or worse. We took a 2.2 mile ""easy walk"" according to the Ranger. We climbed over rocks, ducked through caves, were restricted from bat caves as they were closed due to nursery conditions. We climbed stairs and finally arrived at a reservoir. We entered the park from the east entrance. There is no way to drive through the park. The Pinnacles are in the way. It is a long way around to the west entrance. So we didn't get to see much of the park. The reservoir was pretty. The Pinnacles we saw were very interesting. Other photos I've seen were beautiful. But it isn't a practical day trip.

Pinnacles National Park,"I'm all for protecting our natural resources and love the NPS, but this is one of those parks that is a bit of a stretch calling it a National Park. Not much to see or do here and the landscape doesn't feel particularly unique. I think the park also suffers from being completely surrounded by developed farmland. It doesn't have any buffer from the outside world like most other parks that usually have national forest land adjacent to it.We did the hike to the reservoir and I thought it was the highlight of the park. It's a relatively short hike and you get to hike through some pretty areas and caves. The last stage before getting to the water is a cave and then a staircase carved into the side of the hill. My boys thought this felt like it was out of Indiana Jones or The Goonies. I'd have to agree. The main cave that everyone goes to see was closed because of the bat season, so we did miss that part of the trail. The reservoir is beautiful. Some knucklehead was up there with a pit bull off-leash. Unfortunately the park ranger staff is non-existent at this time of year, so there isn't anyone to enforce park rules.If you have a desire to visit this park (we're NPS geeks, so we had to go once, but won't be back), I would recommend stopping by in the winter months when it's 'in season.' Summer is off-season, and in addition to the caves being closed, the visitor center and nature centers are closed, there is limited ranger presence and no evening programs offered. We lucked out, but apparently it gets really hot there as well.","June 27, 2017",Not sure why this is a National Park,225,"Irvine, California",3

Pinnacles National Park,"I live about two hours from Pinnacles National Park and had never visited before. Last Sunday my wife , daughter, and I decided to go to the Pinnacles. I have heard many good things about the park, especially the photography opportunities. We had a wonderful day and were glad that we visited the park. We entered at the East entrance and decided to try the Old Pinnacle Trail and found good parking at this trail-head. The trail to the peaks was about 2.6 miles (4.2K) and started out fairly easy and flat. As we got a little further, the trail started to climb. It was somewhat steep but very manageable. I would probably rate it a high moderate to mild strenuous climb with some switch-backs. It was a good workout and the legs could definitely feel it, but was tolerable. There were many photo ops, so when I felt a little winded, I could always stop and snap a shot or two and catch my breath. The views were excellent and the Pinnacles were amazing. The weather this day was in the upper 70's and was very tolerable. If you are new to or visiting the Central Valley of California, please be advised that it can get extremely hot in the summer months (100 F plus). On these hot days I would strongly encourage you to get a very early start. It gets very warm by about 10 AM, so again, get an early start. Carry lots of water and a snack or two for your hike. We had a very nice day, I took a lot of pictures, and enjoyed our day in the park. We are planning to go back in a couple weeks with some friends and family visiting from Canada.

We even couldn't make our way all the way through the caves. Possibly with a map we might have made it.The hike to and from the caves was extremely scenic and easy. But entering the cave area through a slot canyon became very difficult. We're all in our 70s and it was a challenge. We were happy that none of us got hurt in that area.

Observed the bird ( forget the name. Black feathers with blue color on top of it's head) and bunny. Getting parking on the east entrance would be bit tough compare to West.Beware of snakes. Some hikers encountered a snake trying to bite n they killed it. Also beware who parked on the west side n come trial to East entrance and return back to West at late hours like 8.30-9 pm. Some hikers were stuck on the day when we visit n it's become night when they started to go back West entrance parking.

It was pretty awesome going through the ""caves"" on this trail where you go through some narrow and low passages although there are bars along most of the route. You're really going underneath huge boulders. Wish I had more time to hike the High Peaks trail and perhaps see a condor. This park is undoubtedly wicked hot in summer; spring is best, but it brings the crowds as well. Quite isolated so one must seek lodging some distance away like Hollister (to the north).

Near the end of the High Peak trail, it was a bit steeper and had railing to hold onto, but overall, I felt the hike to be pleasant and on the easier side. There was a bathroom on the High Peak trail, outhouse style, it was on the messier side for an outhouse, but I'm sure it was just the day we were there. 1) Get there early2) hike spring or fall.

Definitely go in Spring or Fall, as it would be really hot in the summer months and the hikes would not be enjoyable. We did the Bear Gulch Trail and also the caves. The trail is listed as ""moderate"" in the park brochure but I'd actually categorize it as easy or easy-moderate. The caves were absolutely amazing but if you're claustrophobic then give them a miss. There are some real tight squeezes and because they're caves (or fallen rocks which have formed caves) there are parts that are pitch black. Don't be like me and rely on your iPhone flashlight!! Everywhere I read said they're not powerful enough and I didn't listen. Your iPhone flashlight is NOT powerful enough in the caves!!! I'll invest in a headlamp before we go again.

Pinnacles National Park,"We did the Condor Gulch Trail hike on the East side of the park, and the Balconies Cliffs/Balconies Cave Loop on the West side. Both trails had excellent parking areas at the start. However - even though we are here in early May and during the week, the parking areas fill up fast. So - if you can - go early in the year, and make sure you know when the caves are closed due to being bat nurseries. We were told the caves will be closed starting May 15 for several months. That said, pretty much all National Parks have a crowd issue. These two trails were great - Condor Gulch is a steady climb for a mile to the overlook and then a steeper climb up to the intersection of High Peaks trails. We stopped here and had a nice picnic. Scenery is good and the trail is in good shape. The Balconies trails on the West side were even prettier, had a bit more shade, and the Balconies talus cave was great. You really do need a flashlight, and if you are the kind that likes climbing on something like a jungle jim, then you will do fine in the cave. There is definitely some climbing and getting down low to go through some smaller spaces. We had another great picnic after going through the cave. One set of hikers said that, like in other parks, when it starts getting really crowded, there are shuttles to take guests from place to place. To get to the West side, you have to drive a road that is 1.5 to 1 lane wide, and you need to be very careful, but most people are driving very slow and carefully.

Pinnacles National Park,"Beautiful and quiet NP. Never heard of this park before yesterday, but worth every minute of our visit. Only minor was the ranger at the gate. She hardly wanted to get out of her chair and gave us very little info about the park. So we picked a hike ourself. Our hike had very steep climbs but worth every one of them.

Pinnacles National Park,"We've been to roughly 24 National Parks and this doesn't qualify as a ""National Park""! A state park would be more like it! We checked out the campground and bathroom/showers and they both were run down and dirty! We wouldn't stay or recommend. However, to hike and enjoy the outdoors it's ok. There were signs posted that parking lot was full however, at no point during our visit were they full.","April 10, 2017","Shouldn't be a ""National Park""",19,Livingston,2
Pinnacles National Park,"We did the hike to Bear Gulch Cave today, starting at the shuttle bus drop-off, up thru the lower part of the cave (upper part was closed) and then back around on the Bear Gulch trail. 4,000+ steps per my Fitbit, with about 1/3rd of it uphill (all on the way to the cave). I'm not in good shape, but I did the full hike in about an hour with occasional breaks. The cave is well worth the effort. BRING A FLASHLIGHT so you can check out the waterfalls off in the darkness and watch your step in the wet parts. Overall this is very accessible for anyone who can walk. Many families were on the hike, lots of dads carrying kids. I wouldn't want to do that, but if you are in shape, you could do it. There was a part where you almost had to crawl (for about 3 feet), otherwise I was standing upright.","April 10, 2017",Bear Gulch Cave is a great hike for out of shape city dwellers,79,"San Jose, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"We hiked on two trails during this trip. We first parked at the Bear Gulch Day Use Area and hiked to the Bear Gulch Cave. We came prepared with LED flashlights and it is indeed necessary as it is pitch dark inside the cave. Some areas have low clearance and it is easy to bump your head if you are not careful. After emerging from the cave, you hike up a little more and then go up a steep flight of stairs to reach the Bear Gulch Reservoir. To say the reservoir is gorgeous is an over-statement but nonetheless it is pristine and quiet. There are some good photo ops here. One problem about this hike is that the signs are not very good. After emerging from the cave, there are no signs indicating where to go to reach the reservoir. We met another group of hikers who were equally confused. Also, on the return back to the parking lot, there is a bypass trail for the cave but again, there is no sign and the map is not reasy to read at all.The second trail we attempted on this trip was the Condor Gulch Trail. This trail is not considered strenuous but it goes straight up with hardly any shade. Last time we were here a few years ago we hiked the Condor Gulch Trail until we reached the HIgh Peaks Trail at the top of the hill. We then hiked the High Peaks Trail eastwards until it windsdown to the Bench Trail which leads us to the Bear Gulch Trail and back to the parking lot. This time after reaching the lookout point we decided to turn back as we did not see any condors, or hawks, or vultures. If you are not a serious hiker, this trail will offer your ample tests for endurance. If you are interested in photography, the payback is not very good.","April 3, 2017",Nice reservoir after hiking through a cave,144,,4

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National Park is a great day trip that offers lots to see in spite of being a relatively small park. Spectacular rock formations formed when the San Andreas Fault ripped apart the Neenach Volcano and also left behind two talus caves that you can explore, just make sure to bring your headlamps. This park is a popular spot for viewing the California Condor and Townsend's Big-Eared Bats, we weren't lucky enough to spot them on our trip but did see prairie falcons, quail, and wild turkey. We stuck to the easier trails but there are some more strenuous for those able and willing. You won't be disappointed with this park, it's a fun little adventure just waiting to be had.","April 1, 2017","Pinnacles National Park - Condors, Bats, Caves, Oh My!",72,"Houston, Texas",4
Pinnacles National Park,"This National Park is not super well known. I was enticed by the possibility of seeing some California Condors, a species that was nearly extinct a few decades ago. We were very happy with our visit. We spent about 2 hours in the park, entering from the east side. We did most of our exploring from the car, getting out at certain points to look more closely at the wildlife. We didn't have time to go on a hike and two napping kiddos in the car, but it looked like the trails were well maintained and we would have loved to do this.Note: the roads entering from the east and west do not connect, so you are only able to explore half of the park by car, though you can hike from one side to the other.","March 31, 2017",Great for birders!,54,"Norman, Oklahoma",5

There are two approaches to the park, one from West and one on East. You cannot drive between them due to rocky pinnacles. The East side was excellent for viewing and hiking, and the Condors even flew right over the Bear Gulch parking lot for closer pics. There is a great picnic table to sit at by the Welcome Center, to view the Pinnacles with condors flying over, but it is too distant for bird pics from there. I am recovering from spine surgery, so was thrilled to have the condors come to me at the upper pkg lot.","March 17, 2017",Fascinating views of California Condors!,5,"Reedsport, Oregon",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Due to heavy rain, both caves were flooded during our visit, but along with all of that water came a very green and mossy wonderland with several seasonal waterfalls! We were very pleasantly surprised at the beauty of this place. I would definitely recommend visiting in the early spring while temperatures are cool for hikes. We did the Balconies Cliffs trail from the West entrance, fording 8 inches of water to get to the parking lot. We also did a 6.5 mile loop trail starting at the Bear Gulch Day Use Area, heading up to Condor Gulch Overlook, then continuing to High Peaks Trail, taking a left and meandering up among the pinnacles with breathtaking views, and an especially fun jaunt through the steep and narrow section. We took a right on the Rim Trail to the Bear Gulch Reservoir, then followed the Moses Spring Trail back to the parking lot. It was a strenuous hike but SOOO worth it. We're mid 50's and in average shape and made it just fine. Just stopped to rest as needed. I highly recommend going through the steep and narrow section of the hike if possible. The Moses Spring Trail was also awesome. Loved this place!","February 28, 2017",Beautiful in the Spring,26,"Livermore, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited the park from the west entrance and so if you are entering from the east entrance just know that they don't connect by road through the park. This is not a problem unless you are planning to camp which is only possible on the east side. This is a pretty cool place. The pinnacles are dramatic and there are several trails up into the pinnacles that you can take to get a closer experience than just the picnic area. While the trails are rated you can go as far as you feel up to and still get a nice feel for the local environment. We hiked up the Juniper Canyon Trail about 3/4 of a mile before the grade and the steps built into the trail got to be too much for my wife's knees. Late in the day we saw 8 California Condors circling one of the pinnacles, landing on a ledge and then taking off again. The best vantage point was from the overflow parking lot at the Chaparral Trail head (picnic tables/bathroom/water). You want to have some binoculars to see these birds. I plan to visit again because this place is so cool.","February 10, 2017",Condor Siting!,43,"Northfield, New Hampshire",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National Park is the newest national park of the U.S. National Park system. It is a small national park and took us only 2 days during the weekend to stay and explore. The park's namesakes are the eroded leftovers of the western half of an extinct volcano. You can see the pinnacles along many trails available at the park. The national park isn't very big but is divided by the natural rock formation into East and West Divisions, connected only by foot trails. There is no through road that connects the east and the west entrances to the park. If you choose not to hike, you can drive around the park to get from the East to the West or the other way around (it takes around 1 hour). The two most outstanding features of Pinnacles National Park are its high wall rock formations, which are super perfect for rock climbing and its unusual talus caves that house at least thirteen species of bat. In addition, the park's lands are prime habitat for prairie falcons and are a released site for California condors that have been hatched in captivity. We did see them through binoculars although weren't very clear while hiking along trails. Pinnacles National Park is one of the best and most accessible places to experience talus caves in the whole world. The park has well maintained trails to two of its most well known talus caves: The Bear Gulch Cave and the Balconies Cave. The passages between the rocks inside the caves are often quite narrow with many boulders (big and small) hanging on top of our heads (so cool!!). Our kids enjoyed exploring these caves the most.Similar to many other national parks in California (such as Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park), Pinnacles is best visited in spring, fall, and winter because of the the intense heat and the lack of shade during the summer months. However, the advantage of summer months is the lack of visitors. You can appreciate the unspoiled wilderness, hike the trails, climb rock walls, explore silent caves, stargaze in clear night sky, picnic, camp, and watch a Disney movie under the shade of ancient oaks quietly and peaceful.","February 9, 2017",Small National Park But Packed with Activities,211,"Fresno, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I am on a quest to visit all 59 U.S. national parks, so naturally Pinnacles was on our bucket list. The weather was nice by Minnesota standards but cool for the local residents but sunny. We are hikers so we stopped at the visitor center & the ranger gave us an excellent hike plan for the day taking us along parts of the High peaks trail, Bear Gulch Cave trail, Condor Gulch trail, & part of another trail I forgot the name of. We did 7.5 miles of hikes which took us through the Bear Gulch caves. I'm guessing we were lucky because there were water falls & a rapid stream through the rocks & caves. Being California & at times the lack of rain , I'm guessing it dries up certain times of the year. We were here during January after some rainy days. As we got higher in elevation past the Bear Gulch Reservoir our efforts were rewarded by seeing about two dozen California condors soaring above us. Before our visit we thought this would be a one & done national park trip. After our 7.5 mile hike & nice park staff, we will return to this currently being the newest national park (4 years old as of this date).

Pinnacles National Park,"Practical tips based on our experience here:- On popular days the parking lots fill up by mid-morning! We arrived after lunch at the east entrance and found the rangers stopping us from going past the campground. It's a long hike from there to the caves and the high peaks overlook, and the path is pretty close to the road.- It's far from nearby accommodations if you don't camp.- There's no road through the park, and driving from the west to the east entrance takes an hour and a half.- In winter there are pretty big differences in temperature -- once the sun is behind the mountain it can get pretty cold, while on the sunny side it's hot!Good stuff we did:- High Peaks trail -- stunning views.- Balconies Cave -- fun climbing through narrow passages, flashlight required. Note that the cave is *part* of the trail loop (not a very long part though). Didn't see any signs of bats. Read the NPS website.","December 29, 2016",Be there early!,6,,4
Pinnacles National Park,We've hiked this trail many times before but it is always a great experience. Since it has rained and is our winter we saw so much more moss covered things that gave it just a different coloring. It is not a difficult trail but is almost all uphill but when you get to the top its worth the trek. My phone noted I climbed 75 flights. Take water and a lunch and a flash light if you want to go into caves. I've been through the caves before but I don't like being that enclosed in earthquake country.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National Park is a relatively new national park. I never noticed this national park, until accidentally recently. It's about 3+ hours south of San Francisco. The park has two entrances, east and west, and they don't connect. It seemed that the east entrance is more popular, so we decided to try that.Keep in mind that there aren't much services near the park. There's no gas station within miles, and no restaurants. There is a small general store next to the visitor center, but it was closed when we got there. There is a decent looking campground, but that's about it. So be prepared when you come here.Apparently it can get quite hot here as well, so bring water, and come during cooler months. We were here in early December, and temperature was in 50's early in the morning, quite nice actually.We are not super-fit, and the ranger at visitor center recommended the hike through the cave to the reservoir. It's a short drive to the end of the road, and the parking lot there isn't very big. But if that's filled, there's a much larger parking lot if you backtrack a bit.It's pretty much all up-hill through the cave and to the reservoir. It's not super-strenuous, but you need to be in reasonable shape. The cave is dark, so a light-source is useful. Even with just light from our cellphone, we were able to navigate through the cave. The path is linear, so hard to get lost. You do have to climb some stairs, and crouch through some small openings. It was a lot of fun.Eventually you to get the ""reservoir"". It's a lovely spot to stop and relax a bit. On the way back, you take the loop trail, which is more exposed and circles around the mountain a bit more. The ranger said it's a one-hour loop, but we took a more leisurely pace, and took about two hours. A great hike!","December 16, 2016",Great Hike through Bear Gulch Cave,283,"Sammamish, Washington",4
Pinnacles National Park,"Our expectations were hikes in a dry, hot, dusty environment. We were blown out of the water. We are 55 and 63 and hiked a number of hikes on both the east and west sides of Pinnacles...we had a blast. You clamber up steps with handrails, through talus caves, on narrow passages between soaring rocks, through tunnels and it is green when you never expect to see green. We saw a condor and had the paths to ourselves for most of our time in early October. One of our most fun hikes over 4 National Parks we visited this trip. In the mid afternoon we hiked through Bear Gulch, East High Peak Loop, and Condor Gulch on the east. Actually being on the east side, the sun was blocked quite often by the rocks. We then drove around to the south, back north, and stayed overnight in Soledad coming back to hike on the west side early the next morning. We did the Balconies Cliff/Cave Loop....it was amazing...we did bring flashlights...I was surprised that a talus cave could be so dark. I think we saw one other couple hiking the opposite direction. We arrived by about 7 am, took time in the Visitor's Center - the rangers were incredibly helpful. There is wifi connection in the visitor's center if you ask and really need it. There was water in the creek, blue skies and the pegmatic rocks were a delight. Lots of little critters scrambling about. We would rank this National Park far higher than we ever expected.

The bathrooms are good with sinks and are cleaned daily. Site 10 is in walking distance of general store and showers. The hikes from various points in the park offer nature galore with potential to observe californian condors. We hiked to the caves, which is adventurous for the entire family.

The pinnacles are fantastic. Serious climbers will be wowed. We saw a rare California condor soaring above. What a delight. We went in late October and weather was perfect. We did both sides. There is a west entrance and an east entrance. They do not connect. On the west side we did the Balconies Cave Trail but did not go through the cave. Thought that would be above our comfort level. It is a 2.4 mile round trip. The geology is sure interesting. The boulders can be seen without doing the cave. The cave is not what you normally think of as a cave. It is a passage through big boulders and rocks. We picked up a trail guide. The campground is inside the east entrance. There is a visitor center at each entrance.

Pinnacles National Park,"We visited Pinnacles National Park early November. The weather was beautiful - high 60s. True to the reviews I had read we warmed up considerable along the trail. Make sure to wear layers. I am very afraid of heights and was uncertain if I could do the Balconies trail. The lower trail to the cave was fine, scenic and not high. The cave requires you to scramble down and climb up rocks and go thru very narrow passages in complete darkness. Bring a flashlight or better, wear a headlight to leave your hands free. You are not 'walking' thru the cave, you truly are climbing up and down. I was afraid but very glad I did it. The cave is not very long and you have a great sense of achievement when you come out the other side. There was no place where I was afraid inside the cave because of heights; it was more the darkness and being unsure of what was next. My sister lit the path for me when climbing and I returned the favor. I was holding a water bottle which made the scrambling challenging. It would have been better to have a small backpack for the water bottles. The high trail back to the parking lot was HIGH. Beautiful scenery. The trail was wide and well maintained so I could do it but I was uncomfortable in spots. Overall a very nice hike. There were bathrooms at the parking area with running water when we were there.

Once we started walking towards the rocks the view we had was breathtaking, we crossed a cave and continue the path, on our way back we decided to take the hike picks trail (to save time and avoid sunset) Well what a surprise it could be shorter but it was challenging, we climb and climb and climb but at the end I was glad because we could walk between the pinnacles and took some great pictures.","November 23, 2016",Awesome hiking,15,,5

Pinnacles National Park,"We hiked the 3 hour round trip up to Balcony caves from the visitors centre. The first part is flat and easy going. As you progress, you start to see more interesting terrain, cliffs and hills. Getting to the entrance to the cave, there is a small walkway leading to the entrance itself. Inside the first part of the cave you notice the refreshing drop in temperature. Some ducking and climbing is needed here. If the rocks are wet they will be slippery and this will be a little challenging (as anyone who's been caving will attest). Pretty soon, you are in total darkness and some more climbing & slithering is needed, plus a bit of path hunting. You MUST take a torch. It's not always apparent where you need to go next but not too difficult to work out either.Exiting the caves, you realise you've been burrowing under a truly massive rock. Looking at it from other perspectives, it's really difficult to fathom how it got there in the first place, being so big and high up the hillside.We had lunch under a tree in an open area just outside of the cave then moved on before the wasps and flies locked in on us. Heading up the hill path, we circled back around to near the cave entrance. This part of the walk was utterly beautiful. The scenery like nothing else I've seen. However, the heat was intense and we'd already been through over a litre of water each, with a little left in reserve.Back down the path, we made it to the car, got the aircon on full blast and sat in the airflow for about 20 minutes before we'd cooled down enough to carry on. Checking the car thermometer, it was 101F (39C), so no surprise.We drove back to the visitor centre and quickly ate an ice pole and an ice cream each to complete the cooling down exercise.There are semi-wild deer and turkeys that hang out here, which was nice to see.Also, there are mountain lions here. We didn't see one, luckily, but they are around. Apparently, this is also one of the last places to see condors in the area but we saw none, sadly.

It was well worth the drive south from Hollister, but be sure and start with a full tank of gas and food for whatever meal you plan to eat there. There is no place to buy either south of Hollister. The visitor's center does have a good variety of snacks. The restrooms are decent. There is even a nice swimming pool near the visitor's center.

Pinnacles National Park,"I think I won't form too firm of an opinion of this park until I am able to see the east side of it. There are two entrances, one to the west and one to the east. We entered via the west entrance. Eight trails from the east and four from the west. All of which are rated at moderate or above. We did do the balconies cave trail, which is a loop at about 2.5 miles. I didn't do enough research before hand and was expecting just a tunnel for the cave portion. Its not. You have to climb up and down rocks. For one short portion there is a hand rail, but for the rest, its just you against gravity and hopefully you have good footing. A headlamp would be helpful. Its hard to navigate with anything in one hand. It would be impossible without a flashlight. There was no attendant at the gate when we drove in, just instructions to pay entrance fees at the visitor center. The western visitor center is very small, although with very clean bathrooms. A very sparse amount of souvenirs. It was a holiday weekend, so there was a long line of people waiting to pay their entrance fee, and they had one person working and apparently a very difficult cash register as it took forever to process each person. The line took awhile. The hiking trails all start from the parking lot, which is incredibly small.

As the hiking path that we took to the overlook was well-graded and interesting, I'm eager to return, but I'll skip the bat caves again and save time to shop at the gift shop and general store at the east entrance.","August 12, 2016","Rocks, Birds, & Solitude",227,"San Diego, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I visited Pinnacles National Park on a Friday in June - a day off during a business trip. I hiked the High Peaks/Balconies Cave trail from the Old Pinnacles trail head parking on a day with 103 degree heat. All I can say is take a lot of water - I took 4 pints and ran out, and I was really glad of a refill at the Chapparal trail head parking. It was a harder hike than I expected because of the heat, but it was just great. Saw lots of lizards and a gopher snake and some amazing views. Don't forget your flashlight - the cave is pitch dark and you won't get through without a light. I'd love to go back sometime. One last comment - you can turnow up as early as you want to the East entrance, as the park ticket is self service (put your money in an envelope).","August 7, 2016",Great day hike,26,"Guildford, United Kingdom",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I've gone to the Pinnacles twice now (both times through the Soledad entrance). For those who are planning a visit, know beforehand that this isn't one of those National Parks where you can drive up to the visitor's center and get a view of any formations- you have to hike. There are great trails and beautiful rock formations. I've hiked a total of 16mi within the park so far. First we visited in the spring which was a great time to go as its not too hot- we were very fortunate to see three condors! The caves were neat to explore, even thought the water was freezing! Second trip was in the summertime, which was still great but way hot-keep hydrated. Pinnacles is also a rock climbers paradise! As another reviewer said, the pics don't do it justice, so come check it out for yourself.","August 6, 2016",Great hiking,82,"Monterey, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Since we had our dog with us and the National Park Service doesn't let dogs on 99% of their trails (which we knew, contrary to the scolding we received from the ranger), we didn't do much more but take in the view from the parking lot. We also knew it was too hot to hike anyways (contrary to the scolding we received from the ranger). As you may have guessed, not the friendliest NP we've ever been to (and we've been to alot - with our dog). I guess the bird watching is pretty decent (met the 2014 Audubon Volunteers of the Year in the parking lot). Pretty close to the 101 if you're just looking to utilize your park pass (like us). It also had the nicest porta potty I've ever been in - Supersized and fresh!","August 2, 2016",Probably have to hike it to get the full impact,87,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",3
Pinnacles National Park,"The Pinnacles are a must to visit. Now that is has changed from a National Monument to a National Park, it's gotten very busy. Be prepared for some hiking if you want to see the majesty of this park. One of the easier hikes is up to the larger cave systems. But that's only the beginning. They have reintroduced the condor in the park and if you're lucky you'll get a glimpse of one. There is a campground with a store and a seasonal pool. Even hook ups for a few sites. Be aware, it's very hot in the summer and bring plenty of water. Highly recommend a spring or fall visit. And if you're a rock climber or like to repel...here's your place!","July 28, 2016",Fantastic place to explore!!,20,"Tres Pinos, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"The pictures do not do this place justice. For hikers, climbers and cavers, from beginners to seasoned, this is such a majestic place. My first time there we were in awe of the beauty of this park which was at that time a National Monument. The Geological formations are amazing. The variety of color of the rocks will take your breath away at every step of the way. I prefer the eastern side of the Pinnacles though the western is nice as well. I loved going higher and higher on the narrow staircases. Fortunately there are chain holds to help pull you up as well as to make this safer though it is a bit strenuous.

The cool, clear days made hiking easy, especially the High Peaks Trail, which is a must for anyone who can handle the elevation and difficult spots.

Pinnacles National Park,"The balconies cliff and cave trail is highly recommended. It is under 3 miles roundtrip and can be easily accessed from the west entrance of the park. One section of trail requires some ""caving"" where we had to bend down to walk on a path and then descend between large rocks on both sides in pitch dark - this lasted for less than a quarter of a mile, and it was sufficient that we used our smartphone flashlight to see our way. To access the west entrance, you will have to drive on Highway 146 - it is a windy, one lane, two way road, so be careful especially on the weekend when there's a good amount of traffic. Alternatively, balconies cliff and cave can be accessed from the east side via a 6 mile RT hike.","July 15, 2016",Fun hike that goes through a cave on the west entrance,4,"Phoenix, Arizona",5

Pinnacles National Park,"This area has been a National Monument since 1908, but officially became a National Park in 2013. The park is comprised of volcanic rock formations from an eruption 23 million years ago. The has created some very majestic and dramatic scenery in which to hike. Make sure you have ample water, sunscreen, a hat and snacks with you, especially when hiking in the summer months. I was there in late June and the temperature at the end of my hike was nearly 100 degrees. I stopped at the Visitor's Center in town, where this was stressed, and yet someone had to be airlifted out due to a medical emergency. Also watch for rattlesnakes...they are abundant. Likewise if you decide to hike any trail with a cave bring a flashlight as you will not be able to see anything otherwise.","July 8, 2016",Spectacular rock formations,56,"West Chester, Pennsylvania",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I have to admit, I am not being completely fair by giving this park an 'Average' rating. I did not get a chance to explore the park as much as I wanted, and I am sure that the hikes are great, but the drive out to the park seemed to take forever and really limited my time in the park. Of course with more research, I probably would have decided against making the trip since it was quite a way out of the way. There are two entrances to the park, and they do not connect. Do your research before making your way to the park! Weather was perfect, and I noticed quite a few people camping, I would say if you're traveling through the area this would be a good stop over, but I wouldn't go out of the way just to visit this one park","July 8, 2016",Not worth my out of the way drive,22,Maine,3
Pinnacles National Park,"It was August; my husband was on business and I came along for vacation. I drove to Yosemite one day – not my first visit, but my first visit had been in September (kids in school), and I was just overwhelmed at the crowds in August. Just awful, really. So the next day I found Pinnacles on a map and drove down to check it out. What a lovely place! Very different rock formations than I have seen before; very small crowds; amazing bat guano – need I say more? This park is definitely off the beaten path but definitely worth a visit.","July 5, 2016",An unexpected gem,77,"Arlington, Virginia",5
Pinnacles National Park,"For some reason this tells you to enter from the West. After 6 miles on a single lane winding road you find you have entered the back of the park and the visitor center is closed and there is nothing there. It then tells you you have to leave and go around the park another 30+ miles to the main entrance on the East side. The road does not go through the park. Once there it is nice and relaxing, otherwise you can hike 5 miles across the park to the other side. Mind you it is extreme fire hazard and 113 degrees. No shade. Bring lots of water. Park campground looks nice, has a pool for kids.

Pinnacles National Park,My son and I entered the East Side of the park and did the High Peaks Loop Trail that takes you over the peaks to the west side of the park and then back through the Balconies Cave to return to our starting point. Took us about 6 hours including a nice lunch and stops for lots of pics and I believe this hike is about 8 miles long. From the parking lot the trail climbs steeply early on through some rolling hills and the views get better with each step. Most of the elevation is done before the halfway point of the trip and then you work your way down to the West side parking lot. From there it is through the caves which are short but a little steeper and cramped than I was expecting. Had to take off our backpacks because of the tight fit. After the caves it is a flat hike back to parking lot but still a solid hour of hiking. Would like to see a little bit more investment on the Visitor Centers and facilities but this is definitely a beautiful place to visit,"June 23, 2016",Great Hiking,192,"Hickory, North Carolina",4
Pinnacles National Park,"First of all, we went through the East Entrance. The temperature of Pinnacles is WAY hotter than San Francisco and the recommended hydration is one liter per person per hour. We hiked up the Bear Gulch Trail to the reservoir, but since we got to Pinnacles around 2, (the same day our plane landed in San Francisco) we didn't have time to go any farther. The trek 's scenery was beautiful, and the shade of the trees and rock provided cooler air. Inside the small portion of the caves we explored, the temperature was perfect. I would recommend this trail to anyone that has no trouble hiking and keeping their balance. There were many paths that had no railing or rock on either side and one wrong step could sometimes lead to death, however, if you travel slow and cautiously there should be no problem. Children are able to complete this trail, but do caution them not to run and they should be fully able to walk. The scenery was beautiful even though we went in the flora-less season. There are a lot of bugs at the beginning of the trail, but the hike is still totally worth it for the peace and beauty at the reservoir. There are mini waterfalls and runoffs if you look closely that are truly beautiful. The day we went there were not too many people, but enough to have a few cars in the parking lot. There are many better national parks, but Pinnacles is still definitely worth your time and the long hikes.","June 22, 2016"," Not the Best National Park, but Still Phenomenal",10,"Phuket, Thailand",4

It was about 3 miles and took about 3 hours (very leisurely pace with an 11 year old).We went on a Friday.

Pinnacles National Park,"After going through a little bit of the town of Soledad, the road headed into park narrows and becomes one lane in most parts. This National Park is a small park with awesome caves to walk through and scramble over rocks and through narrow passages. It was a surprisingly nice and small park that you can easily see in a day.The NPS Ranger at the center said this side was less crowded- we didn't have that many people - and the NPS building where you get your day pass was new and modern with nice bathrooms.The east side is an older building with just more of the same postcards, hats, toys and trinkets. It also has the same 12 min movie on the park.Follow the NPS Ranger instructions to the cave and take the trail to left so that you are climbing up in the cave and not going down steep rocks which is more dangerous.Even though we have not been to the east entrance, the west entrance sounds better in many ways.The cave on the east side is closed for bat season this time of year anyway and the walk is shorter to a cave on the west side.We walked the trail and through the cave for close to 4 hours and took tons photos and watched for wildlife. I'm not sure how you can do it in an hour and half as explained in the NPS center unless you just run through the trail and don't stop at all to take in the scenery and wildlife you are passing by.We saw 2 condors, scrub snd stellar jays, swifts, grackles, black birds, ravens, prairie falcons, swallows , lots of different butterflies, different bee species, several different lizard species and a coyote, and deer. The rock formations and plant life was really amazing and better than we expected.

The next day we visited the west side and took the Balconies Trail (see my review on that event for details). Having a National Parks senior pass also helps so that way we could visit another day without paying again.

Pinnacles National Park,"The scenery here is unusual, even for California. We hiked the High Peaks and Condor Gulch this time and were not disappointed. We did this in June with temps approaching 100, and we'd recommend doing it earlier in the season, or in fall or winter due to the combination of the strenuous trails and heat. In any case, take plenty (a lot!) of water and enjoy the challenge. The views from the peaks are wonderful - and although the trails are strenuous they don't involve difficult climbs, so they are doable by most hikers (I'm over 60 and chatted with people in their 70s on the trail). Take your time and enjoy this piece of earth. The NPS brochure says this trail takes from 3 to 5 hours - but count on it taking between 4 and 5 hours.

Pinnacles National Park,"I live close to the Pinnacles and go often. I never tire of it! It's great for all activity levels and the price is right. I bought a year pass for $20. Prices will change as the years go by. I typically start on the west side (Soledad) entrance and choose a trail depending on how much time I have. I enjoy the High Peaks trail for a quick cardio workout with two options: the Tunnel Trail offers some awesome rock stairs and views of the whole park (east and west) and the zig-zag direct High Peaks trail will get you up to that high point faster. If I have more time I do the long loop (High Peaks trail is to the right and the caves or long loop are to the left of the west side parking lot) which goes through some tight awesome caves which are very dark so you need a flashlight. You pop out on the other side which can take you to the east side (Hollister) entrance. From the east side I continue up to the reservoir (through more caves!) and then I head up the backside of High Peaks. Makes for a great 9+ mile hike. There are some incredible rock formations that remind me of Southern Utah. Bring plenty of water and sun screen. There are lots of hiking options so make sure you get a map at the entrances or go online to plan it before you hike. The maps at the park have the mileage labeled which is helpful. You can find those with mileage online with some looking. There are bathrooms at either entrance (and water taps for filling or drinking) plus an outhouse up at high peaks. The east side has an information/ranger station at the parking lot but the west side has theirs at the entrance and then you drive in to the parking lot and trails. Note: You cannot drive through the park from the west side to the east side. You have to go all the way around which is over an hour depending on which way you go. Different seasons offer different options too. February is great for going through the east side caves. Typically all barriers are open and it makes for a long cave experience. If in doubt where to go when in the caves, look for the little white arrows up on the rocks which point you in the right direction. It can be confusing and sometimes wet, depending on the weather. The reason these caves aren't open year round is because of the consideration of the bats habitat. If the park has had a lot of rain the east side caves will be closed due to flooding. We have waded in with it up to our knees through a passage we call the narrows that leads to the cave entrance. Make sure you look up and check out all the boulders that are resting precariously above!There is so much to explore and look at while at the Pinnacles.

The views are astounding. We hiked the Pinnacles Visitor Center to Balconies Cave trail, which is 9.4 miles round trip, and it's fantastic. You will need flashlights for Balconies Cave. Also, we visited on a very hot, dry day and you should definitely have hats, sunscreen, and plenty of water.

Pinnacles National Park,"The High Peaks Trail was the highlight of the trip with views of the iconic rock formations. There's very little shade on the trail so avoid it in the midday. Condor Gulch Trail was underwhelming after doing High Peaks. Taking the Rim Trail loop to a beautiful reservoir was a fun short hike (just over 2mi). We also hiked out along Old Pinnacles Trail to the Balconies and checked out the caves (5.5mi roundtrip). You'll need a flashlight to go through the caves and be able to squeeze between some tight paths between, under, and over giant rocks.The only frustration we experienced was with the shuttle to Bear Gulch Trailhead. If you do go during peak hours and have to wait for the shuttle after the trailhead parking lots fill up, they run every 20 min from the main visitor's center and you have to ask a ranger for a shuttle pass beforehand to board. It was a disorganized process when it got busy as the ranger stationed at the shuttle stop didn't manage the crowd well. Other rangers we spoke to were more helpful.","May 31, 2016","Hike High Peaks Trail, Skip Condor Gulch",3,"San Francisco, California",4

Pinnacles was the least crowded and competed easily with Yosemite especially because though the vistas of Yosemite spectacularly grand it was so crowded it actually became hard to focus on the land. Not so in Pinnacles. There is a sense of wildness here still and solitude that enhance the beauty of this park. The views reminded us of an old cowboy movie.

Pinnacles National Park,"My boyfriend and I camped at Pinnacles National Park last weekend and we were both completely surprised and awe-struck by the beauty and geology that exists within the park. It's a small park - 4.5 miles by 4.5 miles but change in landscape and topography from the camp ground and visitor center to the backcountry trails is absolutely mind blowing and makes it feel bigger than it is. Our first night after we set up camp we scampered up rocks and found a hidden reservoir. We joined the evening ranger talk which was great. Saturday we did a bigger more intense hike - the Hike Peaks trail all the way up to the top of the mountains. It was hard - but worth the views and condor sightings. The caves were closed the weekend we went, but we heard those are a must see too - don't forget your head lamps! We had to stay at the RV campground as the tent sites were booked up, but it was totally fine. Some spots have more privacy than others, but its a very comfortable site.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles is the newest National Park, created from the existing monument in 2013. It is a little difficult to get to, around 60 miles northeast of Coalinga, CA, from Interstate 5 (the East entrance) and 10 miles east of Soledad, off Hwy 101 (the West entrance) on a road that becomes 1 lane for much of the ride. There is no road through the park.Pinnacles is another national park that requires hiking to see the sights, although, you can view the namesake formations from the picnic area at the end of the road from the West entrance. The trails are all well-beaten paths and the signage is good. Sensitive areas are well marked as off-limits. There are 'caves' to hike through (really more piles of gigantic, tumbled volcanic boulders) that have small streams flowing through. These caves require the ability to climb up steps and squeeze under or through some tight spots that are not for large people. Bring a flashlight, better yet a headlamp, for the darkest areas and check for closures before going: the bat population is protected.We enjoyed a huge variety of wildflowers all along the trails (we visited in early May) and, if you're a climber, endless faces with ready-made finger and toe holds afforded by the geology of the area (think volcanic concrete with embedded stones sticking out everywhere). Lots of life in the park, too. We saw jack rabbits, road runners, lizards, a water snake in the tiny reservoir beyond the Bear Gulch Caves, lots of turkey buzzards (condors reputedly hang out in the park), Prairie falcons, frogs, and many different butterflies. Best are the great vistas of the chaparral and the Pinnacles that are the reason for the park. Not too many people, just yet but it was during the week. There is a campground at the East entrance with a visitor center, a swimming pool, showers and a small store. A new visitor center is at the West entrance but this side is day-use only. We spent a day on each side of the park and visited the caves on the loop trails.An avid hiker could do much more and see the entire park while camping on the East. We were slowed by our cameras. If not camping, Coalinga or Hollister are closest to the East entrance. Salinas or King City would probably be the best for the West but we stayed in Monterey (about 90 minutes with traffic) to visit the aquarium on this trip.","May 19, 2016",Uncrowded and Unique,29,"Los Angeles, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"This is a senior, day hiker's review. Wednesday May 17, 2016 it was 92 degrees by 1 PM. The hike to the top pinnacles is not recommended for the out of shape, especially after mid morning on crowded weekend trails. Best days are Monday through Thursday because the park is packed on weekends -its only a couple hours from Silicon Valley and parking gets difficult. Come as early in the morning as you possibly can before the sun is pounding down on your trail. You will be carrying your water for any hikes with elevation. Know how much you need to keep hydrated. I have seen larger families urge their seniors beyond their capabilities on these hot, waterless hikes. The Nature Cabin at Bear Creek is very small but shows the geology, flowers and animal scat (fake) and paw prints of various animals. The endangered condors are in the park and you'll see photos most likely rather than the birds. 23 million years ago, the Pinnacles were closer to Los Angeles than San Francisco having literally inched its way North along the San Andreas faultline. Photographers, the best shot of the Pinnacles from a drive to view point is in the early morning. You will be shooting into the sun after that. Get your national parks passport stamped at the visitor center that used to be a private campground with a pool. Cinder block flush toilets nearby.Hiway 146 is shared by many, including ranchers, ranching equipment, cyclists and bikers who love this windy, scenic road between Pinnacles and nearby Hollister.

Pinnacles National Park,"We spent two nights at the Pinnacles campground and hiked the high peaks trail via the Bear Gulch Cave Trail. An excellent 7 mile loop with fantastic terrain and scenery. The High Peaks trail (steep and narrow section) was awesome and we were able to see two Condors. As far as camp spots, there is a wide range of camp spots with most of the good ones in the tent sections. I consider a good site as one that has some privacy. All sites had a fire pit and a picnic table. We stayed in site 61 and I would pick that one again. The facilities could use some updating of the toilets and showers - fair to poor for a National park - so be prepared for that but don't let this deter you.","May 8, 2016",Excellent hiking,48,"Madison, Wisconsin",4
Pinnacles National Park,"PINNACLES NATIONAL PARK has two entrances, one accessed from the east by Route 25, and the other accessed from the west by Highway 101. The east entrance has camping areas, gift shop, and a grocery store, and is close to Route 25. The west entrance does NOT have any camping area and does NOT have any store, and it requires a drive along a narrow winding road that takes about 30 minutes by automobile. When accessed from the west, you exit the highway at Soledad, but once you have left the highway the main road in Soledad does not have any direction sign. The correct way to turn is north (left) when you get to Soledad's main road, immediately after exiting the highway. If you need to ask, you can ask for directions at Carl's Jr., which is located at the highway turnoff.EAST VERSUS WEST. The big question that most adventurers will ask, is ""Should I park at the east entrance or at the west entrance?"" The short answer is, ""It is better to park at the east entrance, for your first visit to Pinnacles National Park."" The east entrance does not require any 30 minute drive along a long winding road, and the east entrance has the gift shop and grocery, and the east entrance has A GREATER CHOICE AND VARIETY of hiking trails. Also, to see REALLY GREAT SCENERY, the east entrance provides easier access to photogenic scenery. From the east entrance, you can drive a bit, and then park in the Bear Gulch area, and then take the CONDOR GULCH TRAIL, and within minutes be treated to spectacular scenery. CONDOR GULCH TRAIL is not a strenuous trail and, all hikers will be pleased to see that CONDOR GULCH TRAIL connects with HIGH PEAKS TRAIL. HIGH PEAKS TRAIL is distinguished in that it provides Ansel Adams-style world-class photogenic scenery. To conclude, these are only some of the reasons why. for your first visit, the east entrance is the better choice.GREATER VARIETY OF TRAILS FROM EAST ENTRANCE. As mentioned above, if you desire great photogenic scenery, your best hiking plan should be CONDOR GULCH TRAIL and then HIGH PEAKS TRAIL, where your destination is the top of Hawkins Peak. Near the top of High Peaks Trail, you can see world-class views of the monoliths with the BALCONIES CLIFFS in the distance. BALCONIES CLIFFS, and a similar cliff formation (Resurrection Wall) near the west entrance, resemble segmented rainbows. Please note that I made up this term (segmented rainbows), and it accurately describes the intriguing and beautiful conformations of Balconies Cliffs and Resurrection Wall (or anyway, a cliff that is near Resurrection Wall). Also, from the east entrance, you can take Old Pinnacles Trail (very boring scenery), or take Old Pinnacles Trail which connects to Balconies Cliffs Trail (beautiful scenery), or take the Bear Gulch Caves Trail (you need a flashlight), or take the other trails that are marked on your map.LESS VARIETY FROM THE WEST ENTRANCE. Once parked at the west entrance, you only have two choices. The first choice is Balconies Trail, which after about 30 minutes of easy hiking along a creek, branches into the Balconies Cliffs Trail (not strenuous) or the Balconies Caves Trail (requires a flashlight). If you take Balconies Cliffs Trail, it is continuous with Old Pinnacles Trail, and you can continue along to Old Pinnacles Trail, which ends at the HIGH PEAKS TRAIL trailhead, which leads you up, up, up, up, to the top of Hawkins Peak. Once you are at the top of Hawkins Peak, you will need to descend down JUNIPER CANYON TRAIL which is stunning and spectacular, and which is best viewed in the early to late afternoon (in the morning Juniper Canyon Trail is in shadows). Okay, now what about the second choice. Your second choice is to take JUNIPER CANYON TRAIL, but as I just mentioned, in the morning it is mostly in shadows. The following is a warning about hiking up Juniper Canyon Trail. This trail is relentlessly steep and has many switchbacks. You do not need to be a conditioned hiker to walk up Juniper Canyon Trail, but just take this as a warning. If you are the type who huffs and puffs while walking up ordinary city streets that are steep, then you will NOT likely be in good shape for hiking up Juniper Canyon Trail. However, Juniper Canyon Trail is a ""must-see"" because one of the view points is as dramatic as, for example, Gunnison Canyon located in Colorado. This particular view point from Juniper Canyon Trail features a fairy-tale style footbridge, and a Lord of the Rings-style tunnel through a majestic cliff. And now another word of warning: If you are hiking with children, please note that a few parts of Juniper Canyon Trail have very abrupt drop-offs, and if your child should wander off or get impulsively close to the abrupt drop-off, your child could fall down and be instantly killed. (Don't say I did not warning you.) CONCLUSION. Pinnacles National Park offers great aerobics for those who enjoy hiking, a fine camping facility, and some unique photogenic scenery worthy of publishing in a coffee table-style photography book. And so, take along your camera and tripod. Tom Brody, Ph.D.","May 3, 2016","A spectacular park with two distinct entrances for autos, connected only by hiking paths",349,"Berkeley, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Wow, what a fun half day hiking cliffs, caves and rock balconies. We did see a Pacific Rattle snake on the trail but he was happy to leave us alone.

Pinnacles National Park,"With Tioga Pass still closed we had to change plans. Good choice to go to Pinnacles National Park! Awesome rock formations brought about the movement of the San Andreas Fault. Fantastic views all the way. Hats, sunblock and flashlight on brief moments going thru caves. Helpful rangers. Well marked trails. Guard rails, too! They are still developing their campgrounds tho. Drive via Hollister enroute to the East entrance to the Visitor Center and Bear Gulch trailhead.

Pinnacles National Park,"There are two sides to this national park. The West side gives the easiest access to spectacular views of the jagged peaks that give the park its name. I was visiting on a Sunday and there was a problem if parking on the east side late morning with the 'high' car parks already full. There is a shuttle from the visitor centre and I would recommend using it. As well as the geology, including impressive caves, there were wild flowers, a range of butterflies and birds.If time is limited head for the West side and take the balconies trail.","May 2, 2016",A spectacular and easy place to visit,50,"St. Neots, United Kingdom",5

The biggest surprise was the stream running through and down the cave. The flora was a big treat, we saw Larkspur, Mexican Hats, Chatterbox orchid, Mariposa lily, Globe flower and native red thistle.

Pinnacles National Park,"Being from the East coast, hardly anyone knows about Pinnacles in comparison to the better known parks like Yosemite or Death Valley. Our gps had a harder time finding the east entrance, as the park has an east and west entrance that does not connect. In spite of this, the park was well worth a visit, and was surprisingly crowded when we arrived the day before Easter. No worries - the rangers advised it would be an hour wait, and they let cars in as vehicles left. We enjoyed a tailgate picnic on the road while we waited, on a beautiful day. Once inside, there was a small visitor center at Bear Gulch and we found an easy trail to hike. Old Pinnacles Trailhead offered a nice easy trail too. Bring your camera, comfortable shoes, food and water. Because this park is rather remote, it can be hard to figure out where to stay if you're not familiar with the area. We stayed in Monterey when visiting the West side of the park, and in Santa Cruz for the East side -both about an hour or so drive. Be sure to visit this unexpected treasure.","May 1, 2016",Overlooked park that you'll appreciate,234,"Burlington, New Jersey",5
Pinnacles National Park,"This is the closest National Park to my residence. Unfortunately that also means that this is the closest National Park for five million or more other people. Nevertheless, despite the crowded conditions of the Pinnacles on a weekend it is more than worth the trip and, if one chooses to, to fight for a reservation to stay in the campground and spend more than a single day in the Park. This park is truly a hidden gem. The hiking trails leading to or around the bat caves, the various vistas than can be seen and hiked through, the amazing diversity of the different landscapes and, if you're patient, the sight of the California condor -- amazing bird, ugly, but with a huge wing span. Very impressive. Come and visit and if you can, do it on a weekday. Then you'll have the park to yourself and you'll be able to take your time here, not get jostled by everyone else who wants the experience and enjoy God's bounty as shown forth in this rather remote but accessible location in Central California. There are few amenities here but throw yourself into this amazing piece of nature that God has given you. This park is well worth the trip and, if you're a rock climber, experienced or beginner, this is a great place to come, to visit and to practice.","May 1, 2016",Great Place Too Close,15,"Watsonville, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"My fiance and I drove down 2 hours from the Bay Area and arrived at the park around 12pm on a Saturday. We arrived at the parks east entrance and were greeted with a line of 25 cars stuck waiting to get into the park. A park ranger informed us that on weekends the parking lot fills up before 9 am. For the rest of the day parking would be ""one in, one out"". We knew nobody was going to be leaving anytime soon so we turned around. Advice: Arrive VERY early to be make sure you can find a spot to park, otherwise don't bother.","May 1, 2016",Wasted trip! Arrive by 9 am or dont bother.,5,"San Francisco, California",1
Pinnacles National Park,Americas newest national park. Small day use area on the west side. Many vary hiking trails and small visitor center.Hard to believe this was upgraded to national park status from a national monument .,"April 29, 2016",Nice for hiking,85,"Vancouver, Washington",3
Pinnacles National Park,"We loved this park, the hiking, diversity of forest, views, and everything that goes along with a great experience. Try to avoid weekend crowds for best experience.Hiking was wonderful. We took the 5.3 mile hike from Bear Gulch up to the lookout and down via the high peaks trail. We took our time, admiring the views and doing some bird watching along the way. The variety of vegetation up and down was amazing, even ending in a cool shaded hike along a creek. Ah, for an extra day to do more hiking on both east and west sides! But that's another visit.We stayed at the east side campsite in an electric site. There is a group water spigot and dump station, no laundry, and pay showers. Bring at least $1.00 in quarters or 50 cent increments. There is no way to adjust the water temperature, it's pre-set, but the water was plenty hot. Gas up and bring everything you'll need for meals as there is no store for miles.","April 29, 2016",Our time here was too short,373,"Canandaigua, New York",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I was surprised by how much I loved this park. It was more red rock than I was expecting. I would allow at least a day and a half to two days to get a good appreciation of Pinnacles, and three or more if you want to get a more complete and full experience.We came in to the east entrance around 1:00 on a Sunday, which turned out to be spring break time, so the east parking lot, campground, and pool were a zoo. I don't know if they were all campers, or if some of the locals use the pool. We were advised to check with the ranger as the parking lot in the Bear Gulch area had been full. They were running shuttles from the visitors center to Bear Gulch, but after the ranger advised us there were a few parking spots open, we drove down to Bear Gulch, which was pretty busy, but nothing close to irritating or congested.We hiked until 4:00 or 5:00 doing the following:- Bear Gulch cave, looping around by the reservoir along Rim Trail and then back to the Bear Gulch day use area- Condor Gulch Trail to the overlook from Bear Gulch day use area.The caves were very cool, and we got a nice chance to watch the rock climbers do their thing. The Condor Gulch Trail to the overlook was a bit anti-climactic. Your overview is a gulch, of course. There were a bunch of birds soaring on thermals around one of the spires, but we couldn't make out if they were condors or not.The next day we came in the west side, which I think hands down is the better of the two - fewer people, better caves, and better overall views and scenery. The road is quite narrow, so you have to slow down on curves and take your time. We never had to move to the side as we didn't encounter any traffic from the opposite direction. The visitors center here is very nice, and the ranger fired up the movie just for us. The supplies and souvenir options here are limited.On the west side we did the following:- Balconies Trail to Balconies Cliffs via Balconies Cave from the Chapparal Picnic Area and Trailhead- Vista Point from the end of the visitors center patio areaVista Point is really just a relaxing stroll through rolling grasslands to where you can get a distant view of some Pinnacles rock formations. We both loved the Balconies loop. The caves were a little more daunting, and upon exiting the caves the trail could use a sign where the trail parallels West Fork Chalone Creek for a few dozen feet. We were momentarily confused as to where to go until a hiker coming from that direction told us. So we hiked the route as caves to balconies, while others who did it in the balconies to caves order said the caves were easier to get through going that direction. Some reviewers complained about the lack of trail markings in the caves, but I thought they were more than sufficient, and I don't see how you could get confused at all. Along the balconies the views of the pinnacles are fantastic. As the time approached 10:00-11:00 A.M. there were more hikers on the trail, but nothing like the east side.We were unable to do any of the High Peaks hiking, which we regret and will have to do on our next visit.","April 25, 2016",Great park!

Go to Bear gulch cave trail route first and then loop around. Less of the steps going up for bad knee people,easier going down them.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles was a national monument for ages before it was designated a national park in 2013. It can be accessed from the west entrance on Highway 146 reachable through Soledad (a beautiful drive through vineyards, Chalone has a winery which is not open to public for most but there is a small bed and breakfast in middle of grapevines.) If you are coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, you will go through the East entrance from Highway 25 to 146 inside the park, and this is the busy side with campgrounds, a store and pool. It was a free park entrance weekend, warm April Saturday (80's) and cars were waiting for parking spots to open up on the east entrance at noon. The roads are narrow and winding on the west side. The entry gate will close at night but the exit side will be open so make a good use of daylight.We went through the west side at about 10:15 am and parked in the overflow lot which is about a 1/2 mile away from the main Chaparral trail-head parking lot. There is a small visitor center there that offers a small souvenir shop and a 12-minute movie on park overview. We topped off the water bottles, put on our hats, reapplied the sunscreen, and left for the first stop, the Bat Cave. O.K., it's actually called Balconies Cave, and the cave is open only when bats are elsewhere. They just go there to mate at a certain time for a couple of weeks and then the cave is closed to give them some privacy. What we did encounter was a lot of boy scout troops, a lot of them. Coming out of the cave in droves. (As it turns out, this is really popular with the Bay Area boy scout outings who camp on the east side.) Generally it gets pitch dark inside, but there were so many flashlights bobbing through it, we didn't really need ours for most part. (The last time, I encountered a pair intentionally working through a phobia of dark enclosed space. It was interesting.)Weekdays would be really great if you want fewer kids and bus load of visitors. Summer months would be too hot for comfortable hikes because it gets like an oven and there are some shade-less stretches of trails. I topped off water every chance and it was still not enough. I was fairly dehydrated by the end of the day. The cave trail squeaks through some gaps in rocks and boulders. Be ready to lift yourself up and over a few spots. Some shallow streams but not enough to get your feet wet. After the cave, we hiked Old Pinnacles-Bench Trails to campgrounds then shuttled (the info map doesn't mention shuttles so be sure to ask the nice people at the visitor center) to get to Bear Gulch Day Use Area. Chaparral stretches out interspersed with riparian bits where poison oak thrives in moist (relativity speaking) shady side. Poison hemlock with lacy carrot-like leaves is found along poison oak and my skin reacts with welts to hemlock. With the plentiful rain over the winter season, the wildflowers are out in full. Butterflies are floating through the sun. No dragonflies yet.  At the campground outpost, we visited the camp store-ranger kiosk there, a little ice cream and hummus (what is it about ice cream after a hike?) and sat on the porch for a long break and off we went. To where? Let me say that I did not clarify the definition of hike with my buddy before we started the day. She was thinking 3 hours, a few miles, which is a nature walk in my book. Hike is something that entails ten miles and six hours minimum for me. Also to add to the grumpiness, the map handed out to you has two maps in it, and I failed to clarify some details. Like take a shuttle to the Condor Gulch trail-head. At this point, my hiking buddy wanted to see about the quickest way to get back to the car. And the park docent gave us the shortest route which went over the peak fast. (The guy said he just had a stent placed in his heart a month ago. He called it ""a light duty"" being outside giving visitors directions.) The shortest way back was through the High Peaks Trail up through the rocky rise and through Juniper Canyon Trail. High Peaks Trail brings you up on a series of switchbacks and at the top you will find a bathroom. And there on, it's a beautiful stroll down hill. And we crossed path with the returning boy scouts going the loop in the other direction as we were going up. It was late afternoon by the time we hit the uphill which was good because doing that midday would be more than dehydrating and draining. I can't stress enough to bring more water than you deem necessary to stave off severe dehydration and heat exhaustion. I went up with two quarts and topped off as needed. And I still needed a day to fully hydrate back to normal. I saw some trees growing straight out of rocks. I saw rock climbers at several walls. And condors once again wheel overhead through the breed-and-release program. My buddy caught a glimpse of coyote somewhere along the lower side of High Peaks Trail. And lizards, everywhere. It sounded like quite a few bee hives are in the area. But they didn't bother us. Overall, it was about twelve miles, elevation gain of 1200 feet, and 6 1/2 hours. And no snake appeared while on this hike.","April 20, 2016",Small Gem only two hours away from the Bay Area,70,"Monterey, CA",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I returned to the Pinnacles after years away. It's a National Park now. I knew it was special then as I hiked through the wind caves and huge boulders to a lake. A real isolated area that I'm glad is now protected. I recommended it to many people who love it, you will too.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National park has the normal stuff, big rock outcroppings, alpine lake, but he big thing is the caves. Not the normal caves created by erosion.Over the years large boulders have fallen into the valley (it's on the San Andreas fault) and created natural caves. Some tight spots require some duck walks or a little crawl, and bring a flashlight as some areas are totally dark. So if you enjoy an afternoon in caves on the most active fault in the state go for it. From the upper parking lot 2.5 mile loop hike with 500 feet gain and loss.Some tips: 1) the sign 76 miles to next gas is correct get gas in Hollister 2) Caves are near the East entrance off route 25 3) upper parking is limited get there early 4) lower parking adds a mile each way and a lot more vertical.","April 15, 2016",Amazing Caves,53,"Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States",4

Pinnacles National Park,"I know nothing about Pinnacles before we went there with 3 other groups of families with kids to camp on the Easter weekend. Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise!The place is gorgeous, like a picture painted by a rough-edged cowboy artist, everywhere you look is green hills, rugged rocks, & blue sky. Our campsite had green bouncy grass, clean & dry. Late March might be a bit early for camping in Northern California... The night time was cold, so dressed warm for sleeping. The only issue with the campground is there are very few shower facility & located kind of far from where we camped.The hiking tour is highly recommended, even for young kids. I took my 5 year old child to bear gulch cave & she loved every minutes of it. The cave is no joke, at several turns within the cave, one has to duck under giant boulders or waterfall, step gingerly on stones in running stream, to go through the narrow path in the cave. Just remember to take a flash light with you & wear non-slip soled shoes.After we emerged from the cave, we are met with a tranquil view of a beautiful lake & the view of the top of the peak. Very nice reward! I kind of don't want to recommend this place so highly because I want to be selfish & keep this place under the radar. But this slice of paradise is indeed Heaven on Earth... Enjoy it & treasure it.","March 29, 2016",Amazing view & fun camping weekend,134,"San Francisco, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited on Easter weekend. We entered the park by the eastern entrance, which is a about 20 minutes drive off Highway 101 from Soledad. Highway 146 from Soledad to the park is mostly one lane, with some steep sections, so we took our time. Once we arrived at the entrance, we had another short drive to parking near the trail head. The trail head had a number of spots for picnicking, but not a lot of shade and it looked like most people had brought pop-up awnings. We hiked the Juniper Canyon trail up to High Peaks. The trail was cool and riparian at the bottom, but by the top it was quite a bit rockier and warmer. I imagine in summer it can get quite hot. This trail is rated as strenuous mostly because of the top, but it's well worth it. We had views of the whole park from the top, and it allowed us to see condors soaring up from the valley on thermals. Everywhere we look things were really well maintained. The park didn't feel crowded even though it was a holiday weekend. It was a beautiful time for wild flowers. A note on parking: we parked in the overflow lot, since the lot at the trailhead was already full by 11am. The overflow lot is about 5 minute walk to the trailhead. It seems that there isn't a huge amount of parking in either lot. When we left at 3:30pm there were cars queued up at the rangers station 2 miles down the road, waiting to drive up to the overflow lot. So on busy weekends you may want to arrive early.","March 29, 2016","Scenic Vistas, beautifully maintained, still feels undiscovered",13,"Santa Cruz, California",5

We learned a lot from the rangers, and the shuttle is a thoughtful touch. The star gazing was a big surprise. Incredible. The campsites were great, but there was only one women's shower in the entire park (and it requires quarters). It's rustic, but you don't need much to enjoy such a beautiful place.

Pinnacles National Park,"Live in the Bay area and have been meaning to get down to the Pinnacles for a few years now. First we had to decide which entrance to go to. That decision was pretty easy for our first trip the East entrance. Then I spent the day before deciding which areas to hike. The Pinnacles is pretty much a hikers park. There wouldn't be as much to see or do if a visitor couldn't do some walking/hiking. I can't speak to how much would be available for the disabled. I was deciding between the 9 mile Balconies/ Cave loop hike or the 7.5 mileBear Gulch Cave/ Reservoir, High Peak to Condor Gulch hike. Met some women at the restroom and they said to do the second option. We left the south bay around 7:15a and got to the park around 8:45a. After a stop at the visitor center to pay our fee and use the facilities we were on the trail a little after 9a. Parking on a Friday at this time was not a problem. We parked in the Bear Gulch area. Small amount of elevation getting to the Bear Gulch Caves. The Caves did have some water on the ground but I used a hiking pole and neither of us got our feet wet. If you are claustrophobic the caves aren't for you. We were told the other Caves by the Balconies are more primitive and require you to crawl around more. I think these were a good start. We attempted to leave the caves one way but thought we'd get too wet so we back tracked a little. There are some arrows on the cave walls telling you what way to go. Flashlights/headlamps are important to have. Shortly after coming out of the caves we got to the reservoir. It is beautiful. Like an Oasis. Wish it had been lunch time as it would have been a good spot and it was till cool out. Next we hit the Rim trail and this is where you start climbing and can also see all the beautiful rock formations. We got to scout point and decided to take the more steep part of the Hight Peak trail. Yes there are some steep parts, some parts with railings(thank you) and some tiny steep steps cut into the trail. If those steps weren't there I don't think the hike would be doable for most people. I certainly wouldn't have been able to do it. Along the trail we saw families with young children, real troopers and more seasoned folks, also real troopers. Hope I'm still hiking when I can collect social security! Someone earlier told us how to distinguish Turkey Vultures from the protected California Condors. We saw many Turkey Vultures but also saw a couple California Condors. Bring binoculars if you have them. The wildflowers were beautiful!We ended the hike down the High Peak Trail to Condor Gulch. Too tired to do any more. It was only 70 degree out and felt a lot hotter. Definitely bring at least 2L of water if you plan to spend all day, more if it is hotter. We were hiking about 4.5 hours, in the park about 5 hours. Cell service is non existent in most of the park. On the highest peak my voice mail signal did ring.We will go back next year and do the other hike. The other hike is accessible from the East or West entrance.","March 25, 2016",Exhausted but fulfilled!,34,West Coast USA,5

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National Park is a classic National Park experience. I have driven by on 101 many times but never stopped. My loss! I went on my own. Hiked, camped and enjoyed the spring wildflowers. I forgot it was a holiday weekend so the campground was full but they opened up the group campsite for several of us with tents only which were very helpful. I knew Pinnacles was home to the endangered California condor but was not focused on seeing them till I started to hike and there they were! Many of them flying right by at eye level. This park is probably pretty hot in mid-summer but spring and autumn- maybe even winter- are great times to visit. There is a shuttle service, a small store with gifts and food. I spent quite a while in the little nature center located at the trailhead for Bear Gulch. (Great old CCC stone and timber buildings) The volunteers there were incredibly knowledgeable and helped me learn a few new plants. I hiked up to high Peaks- nice round trip. Lots of families and small groups of college friends. One drawback was the noise in the campground at night generated by the big mobile campers. They played music (one guy played Willie Nelson incessantly) and even though they were in another campground, they had the music and generators cranked up. Had it not been a holiday weekend, might not have been so bad. We are tents only and go camping to get away from all that noise. Last note- when I left late Saturday morning, there was a very long line of cars waiting to get in. the park staff was working hard to get folks into parking lots but everything was full. Some people looked very tired and frustrated. So, as with most popular destinations- plan ahead and get there early.","March 9, 2016",Why Did I not Stop at this Beautiful Park Before?,87,United States,5

The parking lots on the East entrance were full and my wife had to wait in the car for about an hour in-line with all other late comers while the rest of us did a short hike from the visitor center to the Bear Gulch Day use area. It is along a creek among the trees. After we finally found a parking spot and a quick lunch (no food services inside the park), we took the shuttle to the Bear Gulch area. We hiked the Moses Spring trail to the Bear Gulch Cave Trail, then all the way to the Bear Gulch Reservoir. This cave trail is the coolest (literally too) thing we have ever experienced in a national park. It is wet and dark, many steps, narrow passages, unbelievable hike.

Pinnacles National Park,"One of our newest National Parks, this one is set in a gorgeous part of the country: rolling hills, cattle ranches, vineyards. It is remote! This is one of the spots to see the California condor, if you are lucky. The rangers will warn you that you may not see any, and we did not. Hikers told us that they typically see them 3 out of 10 times. However, some folks also told us that they saw them right from the campground! The hiking ranges from easy to very strenuous, so pay attention to the advice on the NPS website about water and sun! Dramatic, beautiful, memorable. And who doesn't love our National Parks! If you cannot camp--and we did not--we stayed in the friendly, funky, clean Thousand Trails RV site about 17 miles from the East Entrance of the Park. Immaculate cabins can be rented inexpensively.

The walk up to the Pinnaces was excellent we ranged in age from 5years to 78years . Starting from the right hand side we went up Bear Gulch to the Overlook then on to the top and walked anti clockwise around the pinnacles. Taking the shorter but steeper hike down. This was narrower but everywhere that was a bit precarious had a handhold and was fine for all ages. We finished off the walk with a detour to the Talus Caves and then back to the carpark. It took us 4 hours including at least 30 minutes for lunch and lots of photo stops. We think this was by far the best way around as going down was then in the shade at the bottom and quite a bit steeper compared with all of the switchbacks on the Bear Gulch side. The views were stunning and I am sure in spring it must be just magical with flowers out and the trees in leaf. We will definitely be back,","January 4, 2016",Great walk for the family,21,Auckland,4

We had never been to West entrance of Pinnacles (have loved the East entrance hike to Bear Gulch Cave in the past), but the very friendly and helpful NPS rep on the phone suggested the Western entrance and Balconies Cave. We loved it! Dramatic Pinnacles views as you arrive and begin the hike, and the kids report the following about the trek: ""fun, awesome, pretty, adventurous, exciting!"" Scrambling through the caves was entertaining (wear good shoes, as parts are quite steep and slippery). We recommend hiking up the Balconies Cliffs trail and then looping back through the cave--that way you are going UP both on the steeper part of the trail and through the cave itself (easier than going down!).Although we shared the magnificent views and trail with a number of other visitors on this beautiful sunny, cool, crisp Black Friday day, it was much better than standing in line at a mall!","December 31, 2015",Pinnacles Western entrance hike to Balcony Cave,27,"Santa Cruz, California",5

You can explore a lot of it in one day and choose short or long hikes. The rock formationsare stunning and the hiking trails will take you up into and next to them. Unlike any other place I've hikedin California, there are sturdy railings to hold onto in the steep locations. You won't find a steep vertical gainhere but if you're up for rolling hills with occasional steepness, you'll have a good day. The view is memorable.The caves are dark but brief. The rocks in the caves were a bit wet when I was there, making the footing a bitslippery. Nothing treacherous, though. We went in November when it was cool and sunny -- just perfect.

There were maybe 5 cars in the park. You drive far into the parking lot and there are some boulders way up high and that is it!

It was the least crowded, and most comfortable weather wise. We went in the being of January and it was beautiful. You'll want to bring layers. I took my sweat shirt and coat on and off probably six times, and managed to get a bit of a sunburn too. The guides at the welcome center were very helpful and let us know which trails fit what we were looking for. I recommend packing food to bring as the entrance (at least the east one) is not close to a town. Be warned, there are two different entrances for this park. One on the west and one on the east. To drive from one to the other would take almost an hour, so do your research before hand as to what trail you want to do. We did a cave trail that connected to a trail up around the pinnacle formations. There were steep stairs with railing, but no rock scrambles or anything challenging. Lots of wonderful and interesting views and sights to see. If you are lucky you might see condors. We did not, but we did catch an up close glimpse of a bobcat.

Pinnacles National Park,"This is a relatively new National Park, having been recently upgraded from National Monument status. As a result, Pinnacles has wilder terrain, harder trails, and fewer amenities than what you might experience at the grander parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone. I think that's the real attraction of Pinnacles. It's a rawer form of nature, closer to its untouched origins. There are plenty of things to climb, caves to explore, beauty to behold. When we visited, it was busy but not crowded. There were rock climbers using pre-set pitons and free climbing as well. From the number of hikers wearing climbing gear, I'd say this is a favorite for climbers. The caves are fun, pitch black, and we saw very young kids of 4 or 5 thrilled to be exploring such things. It's an out-of-the-way place easily accessed from San Jose or San Francisco. worth a day at least. Camping and RV facilities available.Important: this park has two entrances (East and West) and they do not connect with a road so you need to choose beforehand.

You do need a flashlight in the caves, and despite the stairs and fairly well-marked passages the trail provides, there are tight spots were you have to squeeze, bend down, and/or do the limbo to get through. We also walked the Condor Gulch trail up to the viewpoint (less than a mile each way). We didn't see condors, but met a tarantula strolling down the trail on our return and encountered some new (to us) birds. Fascinating examples of chaparral habitat in this park.

The campground has many REALLY nice campsites. But, some are certainly better than others. I have experienced deer, racoon, wild turkey, wild boar and a wide variety of other birds, reptiles and mammals INSIDE my campground while camping here. My favorite campsites are #12 & 13 but most of the sites in that loop are pretty good. The campground is outside the original park boundries. You can hike into the park but there is also a shuttle service. The hike from the campground to the Bear Gulch Day use area but that trail is nearly as enjoyable as the other trails within the park. Bear Gulch reservoir is a protected habbitat for the California Red Legged Frog (Mark Twains famed Jumping Frog of Calevaras County). The park may be the best place in the world to observe the California Condor. There are several Talus caves in the park and some of the hiking trails go through those caves. Parts of the caves were the bats live are closed to the public most of the year but they are usually open the last week or two of March and October (Check the website or call). Those are also the busiest times of year so you must choose between avoiding the crowds or viewing the bats.

Inside the cave there was more than one option and when we came out of the cave we could see a reservoir and so we went back the sane way. We spent longer than expected on the east side and were held up by roadwork on the road to get around to the west side - this is not a very pretty route- the west side is much nicer in scenic values but we had no time to attempt the walk through the balconies cave which we had been told was more of challenge than the bear cave passage - more like rock climbing than a walk.

Pinnacles National Park,"There are reasons that places are designated ""National Park"" status. They are magnificent, each with its own draw. In the case of Pinnacles, the most recently designated Nat'l Park, it's the home of the California condor. It also lies directly on the San Andreas fault, and the years have created some of the most impressive rock formations, over the preceding millennia. Now I've seen all 57 Nat'l Parks within the 50 states, and it was worth the trip. The western entrance is impressive, though hard to get to, with a virtually one-lane road leading to the visitor center. A few times, I thought I'd taken a wrong turn. 5 miles past the VC, there are some great sites, at the end of the road. If you're a hiker (I'm not), more magnificence can be encountered. The Eastern entrance is more popular and easier to get to from King City (17 miles). The NP Visitor Center is hosted by a ranger, and is connected to a gift shop, privately owned, where campers and hikers can get the essentials.

We started on the east side and did the Moses Trail through the Bear Gulch Cave, and to the Bear Gulch Reservoir and back the first day with a nice display of Stellars Jays along the path. The photography options were limitless. The second day was spent on the west side of the park with the fabulous Balconies Cliffs Trail and Balconies Cave. It had rained that morning so the colors on Machete Ridge were popping and the wildflowers were still in full bloom. We visited end of April and the weather was still nice (almost too cold), wildflowers were on full display, and a small hint of water was in the creeks. Both the Bear Gulch Cave and the Balconies Cave were open, making the cave hikes and scrambles a blast. We heighten the enjoyment of this trip by staying only minutes away at the 'Inn at the Pinnacles' Bed & Breakfast in Soledad, which not only made for exceptional lodging, but for a wonderful happy hour in the evening to share trail hiking stories with fellow travelers. An outstanding experience overall. The park rangers are very helpful, the visitor centers are complete with passport stamps, stickers, and maps (hint to passport stamp collectors - the stamp is identical at both visitor centers) and the west side center is a newly built facility with a great little park film.

When you enter the park you must stop at the small visitor's center to pay the fee and get a map from the rangers. The rangers working when we were there were incredibly friendly and very helpful. They want to make sure everyone is safe on the trails so visitors can enjoy themselves. If you are prepared, you have a fantastic selection of trails to choose from, but if you want a nice starter trail, do Bear Cave and the Rim Trail. The park warns you need a flashlight for the cave, which is obviously great advice, but I used the flash from my camera to see since we didn't have a flashlight and we were okay. We didn't go deep into the cave as they were closed for the bats. This park is beautiful, but be prepared with water and food so you stay safe.

The trail forks and I recommend that you take the left fork going clockwise through the Balconies so that when you reach the Talus caves you are going up instead of down.The temperature in late June was about 80 degrees which is about 15 degrees warmer than the coast. Sunscreen, a hat and light clothing are RECOMMENDED.This is by no means the most stunning national park but the caves are interesting and it does have the distinction of being a national park that is MOVING northwards along the San Andreas fault at between 3 and 6 cm per year!","June 24, 2015",Worth a day hike but nothing more,60,"Oak Park, Illinois",3
Pinnacles National Park,"Our main goal is to visit as many national parks as we can. Since we were in CA visiting the larger, more popular parks, we decided to stop by this one to check it off of our list. In hindsight, we would not have missed much had we skipped it altogether. Upon arrival, we see about 80 people packed into a small pool. It was extremely loud and my first impression was that we were at some sort of summer camp. As we pull into the parking lot in front of the building where you are to pay your entrance fee, there are about 40 kids running around the cars playing tag and being obnoxious. The office/store was so busy that the park rangers were too busy selling ice cream bars to answer any questions that I had. NPS really needs to rethink the setup they currently have for Pinnacles NP. This is a national park - not a local teenage hangout for the summer. If they want to keep the little store and pool there, that's fine, but the park ranger office needs to be completely separate from all the chaos. Once we found our trail (Condor Overlook) and hiked for awhile, we kept wondering what was so special about this national park. All of the plants and trees were brownish due to the extreme temperatures. We really didn't see anything spectacular during our visit. If you're already in the area, stop by for a short visit to check the box; but don't bother driving from a long distance just to see this park as there are so many other beautiful national parks in California.","June 19, 2015",Get rid of the pool/snack shop at the entrance!,121,Midwest,2

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles just became a national park in 2013, so understand that it doesn't have a lot of facilities. East side of the park features a small campground w/ store (VERY limited hours), a RV park, and a couple of trailheads to access the hills where the Cali Condor roams. West side of the park (which requires a roundabout route of 90 minutes) gets you to the Visitor's Station (open 9-5), and another couple of trail heads. It's pretty, and the hilltops remind me a bit of Garden of the Gods... Watching for the condors can fill hours, as long as you don't mind realizing that most of what you see are actually Turkey Buzzards. Trails are generally easy, and worth hiking.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pros: good birdwatching, trails, large campgroundCons: swimming pool, looked messy I have visited all but 3 National Parks. This one goes to the bottom of my list. The reason I listed the pool as a con is having one in a national park may bring relief on a hot day, but it's extremely out of place and the large number of people there when I drove through looked like programs and commercials of third-world countries. It made the place look like a rec center instead of a national park. This park needs an overhaul. I checked the box to say I have been, but if I never visited, I'd be just fine. There are other more beautiful destinations in California. Perhaps this draws a lot of locals, not sure.","May 30, 2015",East side visit,209,"Sterling, Virginia",3
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited 2days. One day entering from the east , the other fromThe west. There is no through road. We stayed in King City which made it about a 45 minute drive each day. There is an expensive B&b nearby on the west side. The Visitor Center is on the East , but there is a nice,new Visitor Contact building on the West, too. Our objective was to see condors. And, the second day, by climbing the High Peaks Trail , we saw them soaring and even gliding near us. Big, wonderful, endangered birds.Despite the challenging rocky terrain -- the outstanding feature of this park -- there are reasonable trails, too. We, 70 year old walkers, took the trail along the creek and up the balconies on day one. Day 2, we huffed and puffed up to the High Peaks for our great reward. We did not do the trails with handholds or steep,narrow ways.

Pinnacles National Park,"I've visited both the western and eastern sides of the park, and I have to say I like the west side better.That being said, our first visit was in February of 2013, to the west side, and we almost had the entire place to ourselves. This time, we wanted to visit the west side. We made the mistake of coming during Memorial Day weekend, and it was a huge mess. We barely found a place to park at the visitor center. The ranger at the visitor center told us there is no parking at Bear Gulch, so we had to take a shuttle, which was very inconvenient. When we got there, there was plenty of parking.The shuttle system was really messy. The first way, we could just get on, but going back, we had to get yellow tickets, as they were only taking drivers. Not to mention the inconvenience, of being bound by someone else's schedule. We would've preferred to have driven our own car.In addition to the messy shuttle system, the signage at Bear Gulch is very misleading. The directions on the signs don't correspond to the map. Our map showed me had to take the High Peaks trail to get to the reservoir, but the sign for Bear Gulch Area, pointed at the other trail, so we took that one. We didn't know that Bear Gulch Area and Bear Gulch Reservoir were not the same place. We ended up doing a loop, and ending up in the same place we started. We than went back and took the High Peaks Trail, and eventually found it. We weren't the only tourists to get lost looking for the lake. Thankfully, the person I was with is an excellent navigator. I never would've found this place on my own. I actually wanted to give up, and head back. The trails here are very confusing, and the signs don't help.They really need to make better signs for the reservoir.This ranger we met on the trail was also rude. We asked him where the lake is, and he said, ""It's right there!"" In a tone of voice that made us seem like we were some kind of idiots. Fortunately, he was the only acceptation to the other rangers we met who were very friendly and helpful.I don't know if the whole place was a mess because of Memorial Day weekend, but I will not be returning to this park anytime soon.The only reason the park is getting a 5, is because it's absolutely beautiful.","May 25, 2015",Beautiful But Messy,140,"Oroville, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited through the west gate. There is an east gate, but the park is not connected. It would be quite difficult to see both in a single day.Stop at the entrance, see the 13' movie and pick up the $.75 guide brochure for the 2.4 mile balcony trail. At a leisurely pace, it took 3 hours. Pack water, hats, and a light for the cave. You can not do the cave without a light. Park hours are 7:30am to 8:30p, but the ranger station closes at 4:30p. Suggest in summer do it earlier or later in the day. Think southern desert heat. Park is particularly pretty with Spring flowers.The balcony trail has at most a couple of hundred feet of up and down. The loop on the trail that goes through the cave is poorly marked inside, so if no one is around, you may need to look around a bit to get going the right way. This is not a walk in Central Park, so when you go through the cave, be particularly alert and cautious.At Park HQ there are about 45 parking spaces, toilets and a picnic area.

The do have a store with snacks and souvenirs. The only complaint I have about this place was that being a national park I thought they'd have a shuttle so my friends and I hiked a few hours to the other side of the park to be able to see everything, we encountered a worker there who laughed at us when we asked about a shuttle, which I found to be pretty rude. If it was past the cutoff time or there isn't one that simply could have been said!

But even the very little time I spent here i know its amazing, and I'm sure Ill be back to hike it proper. Spectacular vistas and good trails. And its pretty isolated and not overdeveloped. You can drive in and park, then your on your own. For seniors and people not looking to do any hiking there's a limited amount to see. This is also a preserve for the endangered California Condor.

We hadn't been since the kids were around 8, when far fewer people visited. It's been a National Park for 2 years now and seems to have got good publicity. This time I took my 19 year old son and we did the high peaks. They said that sections weren't suitable for people with a fear of heights, but there must be different types of fear as I am petrified by sheer drops (like GG bridge), but had no inkling of fear here. It took us around 3 hours to do the 6.3 mile, 1700ft climb, Saw the Condors real close and the middle section was beautiful amongst the pinnacles. Some sections were vertical, but steps were cut in the rock with handrails. The caves could mean a bit of ducking and clambering. Down hill hurt my knee and ankle the most, especially at the higher elevations where the path is hard rock and uneven. Try to get there before 10am to park close to the hiking trails, otherwise you will need the shuttle, which adds 30- 45 mins on each end.

The road to the park a little windy, but really pretty easy. We stopped at the visitors center and watched a short film about the park. The ranger was very helpful in showing us where to go.This is a smaller park- very easy to figure out. You basically continue driving down the road to a dead end parking lot which is the trailhead for the 2 main hikes you can do.Since we had 2 kids with us, we choose the Balconies Cave hike (the shorter/easier hike of the 2 you could do). It was a fairly easy hike and the kids loved climbing through the cave with their headlamps (you definitely need a flashlight- it is very dark in there)The mountains and rock formations are very pretty. We did not see any California Condors- unfortunately. Please note there is no food/restaurants, etc in the park, so make sure to stop in Soledad for water/supplies.Overall- a very nice place to visit. The Balconies Cave hike is very accessible.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles NP is a great, mid-size park with rocks. You can hike around and on the beautiful rocks on a number of trails, and go through two caves. The Balconies cave is cool (especially on a hot day) and you need to walk through it in darkness; I wish it were longer. Regarding temperature, there is not enough trees along most of the trails, so carry plenty of water on a hot day, there is no shade.Two interesting trails: North Wilderness Trail – very few people, you are walking on grass, trees, sand, rocks, etc., the landscape changes as you go; and Steep and Narrow section of High Peaks trail – in addition to the usual path you'll have to climb on a few stairs just on rock sides. Very impressive.Come early.

Amazing landscapes, wildflowers, oaks, and the golden hue of last year's grasses which provide the palette for this part of California. We considered ourselves fortunate to snag one the of limited number of spots for RV/Trailers. Note there is only electric here - no water - which we understood. The busy campground, filled with families and kids, was quiet by 10:00PM. The surprise was the bathroom/shower facility. There are only 2 showers (pay as you go so bring quarters) in the women's room, for over 150 camping sites. Right - just 2 showers. There are other bathrooms around the park, but these are the only showers. The showers have not been upgraded in years; grouting was falling out, one stall was rotted at the base, no lock on one of the doors, shower door didn't close so water sprayed into the tiny dressing area. They were in such high demand based on the high occupancy that the hot water was gone, the shower stall got dirty, no shelf for shower items, no hooks for towels or clothing once you got inside.

This protected bird on the brink of extinction, has been released successfully in this national park. We did 2 hikes (12 miles) in hopes of viewing the condors catching the thermals. No such luck. However, the wildflowers were spectacular and at peak. We enjoyed the dramatic rock formations, the call of the quail and the soaring falcons. The first day out, we hiked the High Peaks-Bear Gulch Loop followed by an afternoon hike along the Old Pinnacles Trail to Balconies Cave (don't forget your headlamps or flashlights). Tomorrow, we will hike the Chalone Peak Trail, in hopes, to get a glimpse of one or two condors!

Pinnacles National Park,"I have been to Pinnacles many times when it was a National Monument but this was my first since it became a National Park. We went to the west entrance outside of Soledad. The visitor center is very nice and has a good, short movie about the park and wildlife plus lots of other information about hiking. Because our time was short we did the Balconies Cave Trail from the Chaparral Trailhead parking lot. I remember camping there but apparently they got rid of the campground 20 years ago and it is now strictly a day use area. There are plenty of picnic tables to sit for lunch or breakfast. If you look around a bit and walk past the first few picnic tables some of those a little farther along are in a slightly nicer setting.As opposed to the High Peaks trail, the Balconies trail is much easier although it does have a bit of an elevation change which will get you huffing. We had brought a couple of flashlights and tried to do the caves first. You have to scramble a bit under and around boulders and eventually we came to a place where you had to climb pretty much straight down into a hole. Since I had a backpack full of photo year and was holding a tripod and am a little claustrophobic anyway we decided to bail on the cave and went back around the other way. The Balconies trail is quite nice with good views, although you will have to do High Peaks to get the full effect. I hiked all the way to the other entrance to the caves, and it looked like you could enter that way by walking in rather than climbing down. There was a small stream there so you also might get wet if not careful. Once it came to a place where you had to duck under a boulder I turned around and did not enter the cave proper.Overall, the Balcony Caves trail was a good introduction to Pinnacles. If you want to go through the caves I recommend not carrying a backpack or other gear as you will need your hands to fend off and it is annoying to have the pack rubbing on the rocks. They are not kidding about needing a flashlight, as the caves are 90 feet or so of pitch black (or so I gather from talking to others who did not chicken out). I prefer the High Peaks trail for spectacular views but you also have to scramble on that one and it takes quite a lot more time. You can do the Balconies trail in a couple of hours or less no problem. On March 20 there were quite a few species of wildflowers in bloom and the temperature was very pleasant for t shirts. This is really a great little park and quite a contrast to the valleys on either side.","March 29, 2015",Great little park,34,"Lafayette, Indiana",4
Pinnacles National Park,"This park has great hiking, caves, and spectacular views! I would highly recommend the High Peaks Trail! Make sure to take plenty of water. We went mid-week and it was awesome with no crowd and parking available at the Bear Gulch trail head. Once we went through the Bear Gulch caves we rarely saw anyone else on the trails. It was very peaceful and scenic. The weather was spectacular! We even saw a condor. Now the downside is this park is not prepared for mass crowds. There is very limited parking at the trail heads. We were lucky enough to get a spot at the Bear Gulch mid-week but forget about it during the weekend. You have to park at the Visitor Center and be shuttled to Bear Gulch. Even that parking lot was overflowing. This problem is only going to compound as the summer rolls in. They only had 1 shuttle bus running which went to Bear Gulch. We wanted to hike the Old Pinnacles Trail but they would not take you there. They said they have 3 shuttle buses but 2 were being repaired. The camp grounds were nothing much and mostly just open fields for tent camping and a cement block bath house.While the hiking and views make this a hidden gem, it is only worth a day trip due to the limited infrastructure. Perhaps being a new National Park it will take time (and money) to upgrade it. Bottom line is this park is definitely worth a visit, but patience will be needed as you wait to be shuttled to Bear Gulch.","March 26, 2015",Beautiful but.....,67,"Des Moines, Iowa",3

I had never even heard of the place, nor did I know it was a national park (it was a national monument originally and was converted to a national park just a few years ago). The park was packed, as we went on the free Valentine's Day/President's Weekend, but it was still amazingly quiet for the crowd. One complaint was the shower situation—only 4 showers total! Not to mention, it cost 50 cents for 3 minutes. I just hate getting nickel and dimed, especially when the showers aren't even that nice. My only other complaint was the staff, which was a bit overzealous and went about swearing after coming over to check on our fire. Give somebody a uniform and a title and you know what happens...Nonetheless, the experience overall was great. My husband and I went on a six-mile trail run along the Bench Trail then hiked another eight miles from Bear Gulch to the Reservoir, then connecting to the High Peaks Trail. Just make sure you bring plenty of water and headlamps for the Bear Gulch Caves. It's no Yosemite or Yellowstone, but Pinnacles is definitely worth seeing.

Pinnacles National Park,"I took the balconies trail (west entrance) I went took the loop to the right, would definitely suggest going the other way. When I got to the caves, I had a flashlight which was okay, but would definitely wish i would've brought my headlamp instead. You literally have to crawl down boulders on your rear end and use your hands (you know, the ones that are holding your flashlight) to crawl through. That part is very short though and very cool. I was walking with a gentleman and his daughter who I think was around 7 or 8. She did very well on the trail, while I was having trouble breathing (hahah) There were other couples with smaller children on the trail and I honestly do not know how they made it through the caves. When I first started, I thought Moderate? no way is this moderate, but once you hit the caves, the level definitely increases. I waited to get to the park at 0930 as to get a map and try to get help at the visitors guide shack. I got the last spot in the first parking lot. there is an overflow, but it adds an extra half mile to your walk. I would suggest getting to the park early!!!The map was no more useful than the one I found on the internet, and turned out to be not useful when on the trail and trying to figure out which loop to take. I asked people on the trail, who ended up giving me false advise. I made the loop as intended- just not the way I had planned. Overall good trip, lots of places to have a picnic lunch.

Pinnacles National Park,"I am a cautious hiker and try to plan excursions that match my skills. The Balconies Trail in Pinnacles National Park (West Entrance) was so poorly described that it became one of the most frightening and dangerous walks I have taken. This trail is described as easy to moderate with minimal elevation gain and some scrambling over rocks. When we stopped at the ranger station and bought a trail guide I specifically asked if the trail was well marked and was told that it was. We first went along the Balconies Cliffs portion of the trail; a delightful hike, reasonably well marked. We reached the marker that directed us towards the Balconies Cave. The trail was not well marked but we crossed a small metal walkway and arrived at a pile of rocks. There was nothing to indicate that one should climb aver these rocks to reach the cave. I was ready to turn back, thinking we missed the turnoff but my husband climbed over the rocks and went on to find the cave entrance. I followed, and there began a terrifying experience. As directed we carried flashlights. However the white arrows at random spots on the walls went in opposite directions making it difficult to decide where to go. We reached a spot that seemed to lead out. My husband managed to climb up the steepest area but I was unable to follow because I could not find an intermediate foothold that would allow me to reach a stopping point safely. I couldn’t climb up or down. Thankfully a climber came from the opposite direction and I used his foot as a place to push off from and both he and my husband helped me reach safety. He was the only other person that we encountered on the trail and I don’t know what would have happened had he not appeared. This is a National Park with a ranger and printed material about the trails. I would never describe this climb as just some scrambling over rocks. It might not be difficult for someone with adequate experience but nothing warned me that this was a hike I should not take. I am lucky, someone appeared who could help, it was dry and not slippery and I emerged unscathed, others might not be so lucky. I have contacted the National Park Service about this situation.","February 10, 2015",Terrifying Experience,43,"New York City, New York",1
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited this park for a weekend getaway, and had a wonderful time. We hiked to the Bear Gulch Cave, the overlook, and to Balconies Caves. All 3 hikes were different, and offered beautiful landscapes and some really neat bird sightings. There are several trails we didn't attempt this visit, and if you are a rock climber there are several cool locations to climb. We camped overnight, and my only issue with the campsite was the size of the bear locker. We have a regular size cooler, and we had to rip the lid off so it would fit inside. Overall I would recommend a visit to this National Park.","February 3, 2015",great hiking and camping,36,"Fort Collins, Colorado",4

Pinnacles National Park,"This was my first visit to this beautiful National Park, but my partner had been there several times as a child. We took a 3 hour hike (Condor canyon to High Peak trail, then down through Bear Gulch cave and back to the Bear Gulch day use area). We didn't arrive until about noon and had to park at the east entrance and take a shuttle in, which required about a 20 minute wait (not too bad). I recommend arriving earlier (especially if the weather is hot), but for us (in January) this was not a problem. I'm looking forward to returning sometime soon and exploring more trails.","January 21, 2015",Beautiful hiking,15,"San Francisco, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"This is a lovely national park with miles of trails, exceptional scenery and condors! I'm from Colorado and have hiked in many beautiful places and this ranks right up there. Be aware there are 2 entrances on opposite sides of the park with access to different hikes. we entered on route 146 and came to the Chaparral ranger station. The small visitors center was understaffed so a small line formed for people needing info and to pay for parking. The trails at the trailhead were not well marked and we were among several people searching for the appropriate trail. Once on the trail however it was absolutely beautiful, one of the best hikes I've ever done which is saying a lot. We did juniper canyon to the high peaks loop including the tunnel trail - 4.3 miles total. At the top a condor flew back and forth just above our heads for about 5 very special minutes! I was extremely disappointed with the number of visitors who seemed to think that leaving orange peels and toilet paper on the trail was acceptable.

Pinnacles National Park,"I only have 1 day to spent, but coming from SF, stayed in Monterey on early Jan 2015, I learned there's a National Park near by. Therefore, it is a must visit place for me.Because, although Monterey has so much to offer, but there is nothing compare to visiting mother nature's greatest creation. Especially it is 1 hour away from Monterey. Try to plan early, leave from monterey at 9am so you can enjoy the drive and not feel rushed.PArk opens at 9.30am-5pmBring your foods and drinks. Go to restroom before start hiking.Top your fuel (although there's one gas station in between on Hwy25) Bring sun block (if you plan to come on summer), hat and some snack in case you get hungry.there are no trash can, so please clean after yourself if you use the bbq site area, keep the national park clean.No, your Cell phone won't work, so enter your address in your car GPS way ahead, so you don't get heart attack like I do. just kidding.Bring some... alcohol wipes, neosporin, bandages, for the just in case situation.wear comfortable hiking shoe, don't do flip flops.you're gonna walk in between big rocks, don't look silly and wanting to look 'stylish'. go Yosemite if you want to be seen.This place is not crowded, I recommend you to come early go home before sunset.There are park rangers, the trail is fairly easy, but depending on your own body condition, you should always walk on steady pace to reduce short breath. the Moses Spring trail is the shortest hike for me and my friend who never hike on regular basis.We enjoyed the walk.Be careful when you walk under the big rocks, don't hit your head on the rock, it hurts.Oh, if you live locally, please do buy the annual pass instead of the 1 time pass.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles has become much more busy since it became a national park. Gone are the days when you could hike all day during a weekday and see only a handful of people. The park is still charming, relatively quiet and unpeopled, and worth a visit if you're able to hike. There are a few good views and vistas which are accessible without hiking, but most of what's there to experience is only accessible on foot. Those with minimal hiking experience, small children, or not looking for a strenuous experience will enjoy the short hike through the talus caves to the reservoir and back which should take an hour or less round-trip. There are multiple spots by the reservoir for eating snacks or a lunch. Those more adventurous and fit, with 4-6 hours available, will be amazed at the incredible views, proximity to the circling condors, and just-barely-there trails. The longer hikes are no joke, bring proper shoes, water and snacks, water being particularly critical if the temperature if above 50 degrees.","December 30, 2014",Great hikes for most fitness levels,92,"East Lansing, Michigan",5
Pinnacles National Park,"I took my husband to Pinnacles National Park for a day trip since he has never been there. It was a 2 hour trip from San Jose. I forgot how beautiful the area is. Yes, it is not a Yosemite or a Zion, but it does not have the crowds. There are plenty of hiking for a day trip. The rock formations are incredible. Not many places have ancient volcanos like this. I am glad to see that it is a National Park and I like that they have some of the infrastructure like the visiter center. These are all new. Here are some things to consider when visiting Pinnacles. -Get there early or late. They have a maximum capacity and we had to await for others to leave on Christmas weekend. We arrived around 1 o'clock at the visitor center and had to wait about 20 minutes for others to leave. There was a long line of about 6-8 cars. The ranger did say that about 1:30 to 2:00 most people, who got there early, start to leave. I had asked if there was a trail from the visitor center to the Balconies cave trail. He said there was not and that I would need to walk along the road for two miles, which he recommended not to do this. The road is very narrow with blind curves. After driving it, I am glad we did not take walk from the visitor center; it would have been scary.-If it is winter, expect it to be anything between 40 -60 degrees. It is much cooler and damp in the canyons. While the summers can be blazing hot. Bring water no matter what. -There are no food venders in the Western part of the park. I am not sure about the Eastern side, which you cannot drive through to the other side of the park.-The caves are very cool, but be prepared to scramble up/down rocks that are wet, during raining season. Bring a flash light. It is very dark in some cave areas.-Rock climbing- this is a big place for rock climbers and I have climbed there a few times. The rock can be sketchy, where holds can be known to break off. Know your abilities. I have had a few ropes stuck here, despite being careful, which I needed to create rescue systems to release them. Like any where expect the worst. The views are amazing with many single and double pitch climbs!!","December 28, 2014",Great small national park,119,"San Jose, California",5

However, when we arrived at this new (2013) national park, we were thrilled. The rock climbs range from moderate to strenuous and the colours - the rocks, trees, plants, lichen and water and sky - were magnificent. Wildlife - acorn woodpeckers, wild turkeys and deer and one coyote.

Pinnacles National Park,"We did not have enough time to hike the full High Peaks Loop trail, so we took the Condor Gulch Trail, which starts at the Bear Gulch Day use area and connects with with High Peaks Trail. We hiked the trail during the afternoon in August; it was hot. The trail is very exposed, so plenty of sunscreen and water is a must! We followed the High Peaks Trail counterclockwise down through the Bear Gulch Cave area. The total mileage (as per the NPS website) is 6.1 miles with an elevation gain of 1,300 feet.On the way up and down, there are some neat views, but hiking among the Pinnacle rock formations is the highlight of the trail. There are some areas with narrow passes and steps carved into rock to negotiate, which made for an interesting trail. On the way down we passed many people who kept asking us how much longer to the top? and did we think they had enough water to make it? Again, bring lots of water, especially in the summer months.","December 16, 2014",Condor Gulch Trail to High Peaks Loop,221,"Mariposa, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"This relatively new (2012) US National Park has not been commercialized like the others. Fantastic trails. If you are a rock climber, very few places are as nice. Three days is enough to see everything. Walk through caves and along narrow ledges, the trails are worth it. Only a campground and small camp store. Don't expect a lot of amenities.

Pinnacles National Park,"Great campground, sites have privacy, well spread out along a long series of loops. Nice store and visitor center. Lots of walking trails from easy and short to long ridge line away from the crowds, some feature caves with bats, springs and reservoirs, and of course the pinnacles peaks. All the campsites with hook-ups are in one loop of the campground, and no generators are allowed in any campsite at any time. Sweet for those of us who do not need hook-ups, and who like peace and quiet. I recommend the first loop, sites 1 through 14, you are walking distance to the one shower building, the camp store and the free shuttle bus to hiking trail heads. The firewood they sell is great, dry and includes fire starter kit. Hiking... Get an early start to avoid the crowds that arrive as day trippers around 11am, there were a lot of people on the trails in the afternoon, noisy and busy. If you want to see Condors you have to go early, or very late in the afternoon and be prepared to finish your hike in the dark. The Condor is very shy of people, if you see one soaring nearby freeze in your tracks and just watch it, if they see you they're gone. I did the High Peaks Loop, about 6 miles, it was great. I want to go back and do the Balconies trail, and see the caves too.","December 1, 2014","Pinnacles Campground, Hiking with Condors",314,"Groveland, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"This is a nice park but nowhere in comparison to, say, Zion National Park. We visited it during this holiday weekend and had plan to hike the 6.1 mile High Peaks trail. But it was spoiled by the unfortunate fact that there was only one shuttle running to get people up to the trail head where there was very limited parking space. The wait time for the 3 mile ride was one hour! By the time we finally situated ourselves at the trail head, it was already 2:50pm, and there went out plan to reach the peaks, given that the last shuttle back would be at 4:45pm. We ended up hiking a shorter trail that took us through a bat cave and led to a little reservoir before looping back. It was a nice trail but worth the more than 2 hours of driving for us.So you better take into consideration the shuttle schedules and waiting time when planning your visit. We did not know it before hand. One other tip is that it's worthwhile to make a stop to visit Mission San Juan Bautista on the way if you are driving from the Bay Area.","November 29, 2014",Nice but not impressive ,199,"San Francisco, California",3
Pinnacles National Park,"First of all, I'd say this is a beautiful park, although it's not as spectacular as Yosemite. NPS' pamphlet says about Balconies cliffs/cave loop is ""Easy to Moderate. This trail through Balconies cave may require a bit of scrambling through talus passages. Wading may be required in winter. Flashlight required in cave."" I'd warn future goers that the scrambling is not a bit but a lot. You literally climbing up, down and through a jumble of huge boulders in darkness. Especially if you wade through water, climbing on boulders with slippery shoes could be more difficult, even dangerous. Couple times I need to figure out in the darkness which way to lead me out. This is not fun. The least NPS could do is to paint some white arrows on the cave wall to indicate directions. I'd suggest to try the cave trail first. If you find this is too much for you, you could easily back out. NPS should consider the information on its pamphlet is for common people, young and old, strong and not so strong, to consume. - comment from a non-spelunker","November 28, 2014",National Park Service's information is misleading,9,"Sunnyvale, California",4

Only two complaints: the ranger station at the west end was closed, so no help to plan the day and no stamp for the National Parks passport. And the hike we did -- Balconies Cave Trail -- seemed to dead-end at one entrance to the cave. Maybe we're not savvy enough hikers, but if the cave in fact doesn't dead end, a little more signage would be appreciated. On the other hand, we had to double back and ended up doing the Balconies Cliffs Trail twice, which isn't all bad.","November 20, 2014",good hiking park,17,"Morris County, NJ",4
Pinnacles National Park,"Explored this new NP last weekend. Considered the West vs the East entrance, and decided on the West entrance. This seemed more user friendly (access off 101 in the town of Soledad). For day hikes from the West, this is an awesome place. One hour to eight or more hikes are available. First hike was up to the High Peaks and back. Second day was through the High Peaks to the East side of the park. Proceeded north on the Old Pinnacles to the Balconies Cave and back to the parking lot; this hike was listed as close to 9 miles but seemed more. I have hiked all over the Southwest and Yosemite, and this was a truly unique park. Very steep and narrow canyons had house size boulders on top of them. Some of the trails had a Grand Canyon and Bryce NP feel to it; but different. And don't forget about the Condors! We saw one high in the sky on the first day.

There are NO roads connecting the two sections, but you can travel via hiking trails. Because the park is new the roads and other facilities are pristine. The visitor center is a nice place to start your adventure. We visited the western section of the park. There are two separate hiking trails. One is the Balconies Trail and the other is the Pinnacles Trail. The Balconies Trail has a ""cave"" to negociate, and it can be difficult. We went in October and it was rather dry, but one can see how beautiful it would be in the Spring. We hoped to see Condors, but no luck.

Pinnacles National Park,"We spent two days/one night at Pinnacles National Park and were happy to have visited. The park is only about a 2-2.5 hour drive south of San Francisco and it was great to get to what felt like a very out-there, isolated spot in nature after only a couple hours of driving.The campground was large and our site (62) was roomy and had a big tree which would provide much needed shade in the hotter months. The only downside to being under a tree was all the acorns that we had to sleep on top of. The campground facilities were fine...bathrooms were clean and the store had plenty of snacks/useful items. The only downside was that the store closed relatively early for a Saturday (5 pm). Also, the bathrooms in our loop had light fixtures but the lights didn't appear to work so going to the bathroom at night requires a headlamp!Due to the drought we couldn't have a campfire. Not like that is anyone's fault but it would have been nice on Saturday as the night was pretty chilly (got into the low 40's) and damp.We hiked the Moses Spring to Rim Trail Loop which passed through a cave and offered lots of rock formation views. Definitely wear good hiking shoes and bring a flashlight for the cave portion as it was slippery and very dark. We also hiked to the Condor Gulch Overlook but were not super impressed by the overlook...there are definitely more impressive vistas in the park.Our bigger hike included the Old Pinnacles Trail to Balconies Cave and then a portion of the High Peaks Trail. There was lots of elevation change with many beautiful views. The Balconies Cave were really cool to hike through but SUPER dark so a little creepy.We passed plenty of other people on the trails but it was not crowded at all, which was great. In general, the park was not very crowded.Overall, this park was great especially for how close it was to the Bay Area. I know they recently became a National Park and probably don't have a TON of visitors at this point but I'm hoping they eventually upgrade a few of their facilities (longer campground store hours, working lights in the bathrooms) so that it feels more like a National Park.

Instead of going to May Lake in Yosemite National Park or up to Crescent Meadow in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks I had to find an alternative. What I found was a hidden gem called Pinnacles National Park. Park is off of Highway 25 coming out of Hollister. Looks like there are numerous trails with lots of opportunities to explore. Today, I took the Old Pinnacles Trail to the Balconies Cave. Great hike with very little change in elevation. Caught some glimpses of the sun rising and making the top of a rock formation look like gold. The caves themselves were beautiful. On the walk back from the cave, I spotted an eagle standing on the ground. Didn't get too close as it was one Big Bird.

The entry is the driveway and the campsite outlined by tall bushes so you are very secluded. If we were not in a drought there would have been a creek behind the site. The big issue we had is the heat and the bugs that were not deterred by bug spray or citronella. We couldn't even open our mouths or else a bug would have flown in! Site #68 is also close to the bathrooms but not directly in front of them. I didn't see showers but the toilets were pretty clean.

The campground is nicely laid out, with plenty of taps for running water and several conveniently located toilets, also with running water. There is a shower pavilion near the Visitor Center that takes about 5 quarters for a good shower (with plenty of hot water!).Note: Camping is only accessible from the East entrance. and it was hot, over 100 degrees, so plan accordingly and stay hydrated. also, it got down to the mid-40's at night, so you need a variety of clothing.Camping sites are a bit close to each other, but being there in early October, during the week, we had our pick and really liked the spot we stayed in. No fires were allowed wen we were there, due to the extreme drought, but otherwise, the camping was perfect.We especially enjoyed the variety of creatures, non particularly shy, that we got to see.

We eventually learned that there is NO road through the Park. You can enter either the East side or West side but you can't drive through the place. We found the West access had a portion of the road as One Lane. Very narrow, extremely curvy and IMHO dangerous. I was worried about another vehicle driving too fast and really hoping we didn't find a big RV coming at us. I would suggest using the East entrance. I believe the services available there are much better.Unhappily the West visitor center was not opening until 9:30 a.m. so we couldn't get in.. the west road doesn't go in very far before it ends at a trail head.

You will have to get out of the car and hike to see this beautiful area; roads come up to both east and west sides but there are no roads in the park YAY!We were just there last week and the weekend was busy but not overly crowded. There are a variety of trail types; you can walk to Balcones Cave (flashlight required), you can climb up the the Pinnacles, you can take the Steep and Narrow trail over the massive rocks. They do have railings in the steepest parts.The short loops can be done in 1-2 hours while the longer loops will take 8-9 hours. The trail to the cave is relatively flat and easy. If you add the trail that goes up and over the cave you get some beautiful views with just a moderate climb.The trail up to the Pinnacles on the other hand is a relentless 2.5 mile climb, but worth every huff and puff. Once you get to the top you have several options on where to go next.We spent two days there, I think three would be ideal since we did not make it to the the Bear Cave where the bat colony lives.Pinnacles National Park is no Yosemite but it is beautiful, and unique so get your Senior Park Pass (if you qualify), put on your walking shoes and go there.","September 24, 2014",Steep and Narrow Trail,24,Colleyville,5
Pinnacles National Park,"We visited Pinnacles National Park on the last Saturday of summer. As stated by others, we started early and were glad we did. We arrived at the visitor’s center on the east side at 9:00 a.m. There were a number of people wandering around because they weren’t open at 9:00 a.m. and there were no maps. The sign said it opened at 0 a.m. (which wasn’t very helpful). After peering into the window, we found that it opened at 9:30. Not wanting to start exploring without a map, we waited until they opened. The person behind the counter was surprised there were no maps in the kiosk. Also, the fee to enter the park is $10.00. If you want to start hiking before 9:30, you may want to download and print a map in advance.We parked at the Bear Gulch Day Use Area and climbed the Condor Gulch to High Peaks Loop. If you are an avid hiker, this climb is not very difficult. Yes, you will sweat, but it is not brutal - especially if you hit it early. We also did the High Peaks Loop and Tunnel Loop and both were very scenic with some steep and narrow trails. My calves felt it the next day. We went down to the reservoir using the Bear Gulch trail down to the cave trail. Do not miss visiting the cave. We determined that we did a nine mile hike in about 4 hours with plenty of stops to view the scenery.Please take plenty of water. I think between the two of us we had four liters and we used it all. There is a pit toilet on the high peaks trail, but no water. Also bring plenty of snacks as there aren’t any stores outside of Hollister.

Pinnacles National Park,"I still say for ""pinnacles,"" Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona is much better, but California apparently has more political pull. Pinnacles does have (rarely seen) condors and Chiricahua has frequently-seen Coati Mundi. Other wildlife is about the same but in Pinnacles they seem to frequent the campground without concern for the people-- several blacktail deer napping under the trees all day, and turkeys and quail wandering freely. All that said, if you are a ""National Park Collector"" (we've been in all 59, was 58, now), you have to see this one. You can travel the curvy road in here from the nearest junction in about an hour. You can drive to the end of both park roads in about 1/2 hour, and you will have seen and photographed most of the ""pinnacles."" Make Bear Gulch your last stop; there's a small nature center there, then drive on up to the trail head and go see the one unique feature here, the ""talus cave"" at Bear Gulch. Take a flashlight! It's a 2-mile roundtrip with a lot of uphill, but it's not difficult and it's very interesting to see how these huge boulders have been shaken (by earthquakes) into the narrow gulch to form ""roofs"" on the cave. You can stay in the campground, but you can easily see this whole park in a day, and stay somewhere else.","September 10, 2014",Chiricahua is better,361,"Minneapolis, MN",3
Pinnacles National Park,"I enjoyed my first hike in Pinnacles National Park. The 2 mile cave hike I took was a bit tough on this 74 year old, but I survived. Next time I will take less camera equipment. The views are spectacular. The caves are fun but a bit tough on Senior Citizens. By the way, be sure you have your National Park Senior Pass.

Also bring plenty of water and make sure you know where you are going. Check the maps or bring one with you while hiking. We stayed overnight in Salinas. There is a bed and breakfast near the west entrance to Pinnacles so check that out as well as an option.

It was very hot and dry in late August but we went early in the morning and had a great hike up to the Balconies talus caves. becasue of the heat there was not a lot of wildlife but we did see some bats in the cave and a very large tarantula crossing the road as we left. I hope to go back in the Spring when it is cooler and the flowers are in bloom. The only drawback we encountered was the very narrow road (Rt 146) leading into the Park from the west - not a bad drive during the day but tricky in the dark.","September 2, 2014",Well worth the trip,43,"Clinton, MA",5

Pinnacles National Park,"We recently visited this park for a 2 night camping trip. Turned out to be pretty good. Some things to be aware of-1- it is pretty remote- ie the nearest town Hollister is about 30 miles away. That in itself is not a problem, but the problem was no cell phone coverage about 4-5 miles out of Hollister. So to make a phone call, it is impossible within the 25 mile radius2- It is more arid and desert like, which is unlike some of the Lush green and tall redwood tree parks which are more in our area 3- Bathrooms, swimming pool cleanliness is so so.4- Fire danger was high, so no campfires were allowed. The good-1- We had a group campsite and that was amazing. It was #134. Each campsite is pretty different, some have no shade, some have partial shade, so do check out the park's facebook page to see the pictures. I would go to #134 again, it has a huge tree which creates a canopy and we pitched our tent under that. The only problem is the 3 picnic benches are in the wide open, no shade and only one in the shade. Young kids would enjoy this2-the trails and caves are a lot of fun. Very unique experience3- Nice and well stocked visitor center convenience store","August 11, 2014",Good for a Group Camping,13,"Saratoga, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"My wife and I visited Pinnacles National Park in May 2014 and were pleasantly surprised by the experience. We weren't expecting much as the park is relatively small and semi-arid. Visitation in May was very light with most of the people situated between the Visitor Center and the Bear Gulch Day Use Area. We stopped at the Visitor Center first and talked to rangers there about trail conditions, cave closures and any other tips they had to offer to hikers in the park. We parked our car at the Bear Gulch Day Use Area and hiked to Bear Gulch Cave. The cave was partially closed because the bats were still there. However, the closed area represents only about 10% of the total cave length so we were still able to see 90% of the cave. The cave was rather ho-hum with not much of interest other than it's a cave. However, it adds variety to the total hike itself and in that sense it was enjoyable to do. The cave appears to have been formed by erosion and falling boulders. Take a bright flashlight as it's very dark and the footing is sometimes tricky. We exited the cave at the upper end near Bear Gulch Reservoir. From the reservoir we took the Rim Trail and connected to the High Peaks Trail. We hiked the High Peaks Trail and returned to our car on the Condor Gulch Trail. I recommend doing the loop in the clockwise direction because it's just more pleasant to do it that way. While in the High Peaks we observed at least two and possibly three California Condors soaring overhead. They may be ugly on the ground but they're so majestic in the air. I highly recommend the High Peaks Trail however you choose to get up there. It's very scenic and one of just a few places you can see a California Condor. The following day we traveled to the west side of the park to hike the Balconies Cave and Cliff loop trail. It's a short hike but quite enjoyable especially when there is no one else around. Take a bright flashlight into the cave to make your journey easier. While returning on the Balconies Cliff Trail we stopped to watch what we initially thought were two California Condors soaring in and out of the clouds overhead. However, judging by their flight characteristics they were probably turkey vultures. It was still enjoyable to watch them soaring on the thermals. The highlights of this park are the rock formations (pinnacles) in the High Peaks and the California Condors. If you enjoy hiking you'll enjoy this park.","August 5, 2014",Very good hiking...,71,"Kaneohe, Hawaii",4
Pinnacles National Park,"Compared with other national parks nation wide or California wide, this one is definitely not good enough. We went there in summer.

Pinnacles National Park,"it is the most recent national park in the States, it is much smaller than some of the big names, but it has character and if you are in the area, just plan a couple of hours for the visit. In summer can be very very hot, easily 100+F, be prepared and take plenty of water with you, even for the short trail and loop.The west entrance is suggested if you come from Carmel, Monterey or the Carmel Valley, it is on the 146, after the entrance gate you drive for a few miles and then reach the end of the road and the parking lot. Narrow and winding road, but well kept and entertaining.I have only done the trail to the balconies and the caves, in this order, clockwise, not more than two hours. The trail to the balconies goes up and it is quite in the sun, then you go down to the caves, the temperature drops a lot and offer a great break, you need a light to go across the first section, the second one is more illuminated and reminds me a slot canyon, with some fallen rock over your head.

We saw snakes swimming (& devouring frogs), deer, plenty of butterflies, lizards and dragonflies. We hiked talus caves and clambered over rocks. In fact what we had intended as a quick stop over during an afternoon drew us back for another hike the next day in the cool of morning.Be prepared, you'll need plenty of water even on the short trails.

Pinnacles National Park,"Newest National Park is a good addition to the NPS. We visited the east side on a hot Saturday in July - was surprised to see it so crowded. Took the hike to Bear Gulch caves and the reservoir - even though part of the caves were closed due the bats being there, the caves were still quite nice and interesting to look at (and nice and cool). We never found the hiking trail map with the descriptions of the numbered trail markers - Park Service could improve on that. It is obvious the handrails and narrow stairs were put in years ago - they lended an old time charm to the hike through the caves and up to the reservoir. Was pleasantly surprised to see water in the reservoir due to the current severe drought - but water level is definitely lower than it has been in the past as evidenced by the high water marks. Lots of areas to picnic and hike. Due to the extreme heat we opted to not hike in the afternoon, will go back in cooler months and also make a point to visit west side too as several other hikers recommended going there too. If you can't walk or hike this park is probably not for you - views from the roads are OK but not spectacular.","July 27, 2014",Nice easy hike on east side,41,"Oak Hills, CA",4

Pinnacles National Park,"This loop is primarily composed of the Condor Gulch Trail plus the western portion of the High Peaks Trail. this was not apparent to me in reading on the Park website.This is a trail of quite interesting views. it is moderately difficult, at least if taken counterclockwise. I chose to go counterclockwise for 2 reasons: a) to get most of the 1000+ feet of climb out of the way in the first quarter of the hike, which I started before the day had fully heated up, and b) so that most of my climbing would not be through the very narrow and steep portion of the High Peaks Trail. This worked, and in decent though not superb shape at age 63, I had no difficulty. So get onto this 5.5 to 6.1 mile trail, and see the Pinnacles up close and personal ,as well as from a distance, not to mention the luscious valley views.

Pinnacles National Park,"Camping, hiking, scenery, endangered condors, even a ""bat cave."" The Pinnacles FINALLY was elevated to the status of a National Park. Hopefully it will now receive the necessary funding to update many of the facilities.CA-Hwy 146 does not extend through the park. The park has 2 entrances. If you want to see the larger portion of the park you must enter through the East Pinnacles entrance off of CA Hwy-25. You can get there from I-5 through Coalinga or CA Hwy-25 through Hollister.It is HOT and DRY here during the summer months. Bring lots of food, drinks, sturdy hiking boots, a flashlight, a shade hat and bug spray (mosquitoes). Rattlesnakes are frequently seen in the back country as well. There are many caves to explore, some containing rare endangered species of bats.This park is REMOTE. The closest gas station or restaurant is 45 miles away in Hollister, CA (Hollister has fast food chains, Target, KMart, Safeway, major gas stations, a hospital w/helipad). There is a VERY small store right inside the east entrance. No gas, service station or repair facilities.In the spring, flocks of wild turkeys can be seen strutting in the meadows near the campground. Mountain lion, deer, fox and wild pigs are frequently spotted in the park.Before you set out on a hike, check with one of the many park volunteers to determine the difficulty of the terrain, shade, sights, etc. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. They even hire local high school kids as volunteers. I was surprised to hear them speak French and Spanish to foreign visitors!One volunteer, Morgan, was especially helpful in helping us select the appropriate trail for our fitness level. He even directed us to the proper shuttle bus and schedules, so we could leave our car parked at the entrance lot. He explained that the condor breeding program was closed to the public. He even taught us that the Pinnacles were one day (millions of years ago) down near Los Angeles. (Maybe public pressure can be brought to open it for tours & viewing - of course through one way glass).Glad that the Pinnacles was elevated to the status of a National Park. Is is well deserved.

Pinnacles National Park,"We started our Spring Break RV road trip with a night in Pinnacles. There is only one RV campground, which is accessed through the East Entrance to Pinnacles, off hwy 25 thru Hollister, then down highway 146 into the park. 146 DOES NOT go through the park, so be sure to choose the right entrance to what you want to see and do at Pinnacles. The campgrounds are very pleasant and natural. There is a small store and pool which are open limited hours. We were there midweek but would have liked to attend the nightly ranger program that takes place in their amphitheater on weekends. Our favorite hike was the Bear Gulch caves which were AWESOME! Keep going up to the reservoir and the loop along the rim to feel like you have climbed to the top of the world and be sure to bring a flashlight for the caves. My kids age 10 and 13 both LOVED this trail, which gave a ton of adventure BANG for the hiking BUCK (total miles about 2.5 with a 500 foot elevation climb, but great scenery and all downhill on the way back.... ) and so did my husband who is NOT an enthusiastic hiker. The campgrounds were fun to ride around with our bikes, and we could have biked to some trail heads. There also seemed to be a shuttle bus. It looked to me as if overall the East Entrance has more trails than the west. The Balconies trail looks cool on the West side, but it appears to be a lot longer hike. Best of all Pinnacles is less than a 2 hour drive from the Bay Area, meaning you can easily get there leaving Friday afternoon, and be chilling in time to enjoy a campfire and a weekend of feeling very, very far away. We saw condors flying around the cliffs in the early evening, also saw many California quails, rabbits, woodpeckers, ground squirrels, deer and other wildlife. You will need your bug repellant at night! Even during Spring Break in the campground did not feel very crowded. Be warned also that even though it was very warm during the days and evenings, it got down to 40 degrees at night.

The east side is the most crowded; in fact, we had to park and wait about 45 minutes for a shuttle bus (not good). Once we got to the last stop on the road, there was good hiking, serious rock climbing, a cave to walk through and great vistas. The west side, by contrast, was close to empty. We enjoyed hiking, a really great (and a bit challenging) cave trek, condors flying high above us and near solitude. This is a great place to get away from the crowds of the more popular national parks like Yosemite - certainly not as spectacular, but still worthy of the ""national park"" designation.

Pinnacles National Park,"It’s the newest national park named last year. The entrance fee is only $5 per vehicle; it’s cheaper than a state park fee. It’s located 1.5 hours southeast of San Jose and half hour from Hollister off the East entrance. Since there is no lodging or restaurant in the park, it’s easy to take day trip from San Jose. You can pick up snacks, lunch or dinner on Rt. 25 when you go through Hollister. There are camp grounds with a swimming pool at the East entrance. If you coming from the north like San Jose, you’ll most likely take Rt. 25 and enter the park on the East entrance.Pinnacle is more like a state park than a national park. There isn’t much to see so don’t have high expectations. There are several long hiking trails. We spent 4 hours at the park and enjoyed it. There is park shuttle to take you from the East Entrance visitor center to the Bear Gulch lot. The Bear Gulch trail through the cave was interesting. Along the trail, there are huge rocks and you can see rock climbers here and there. The trail through the cave was narrow and dark. You need a flash light. It was fun since you pass through some narrow gaps and steps along a stream/small waterfall. After the cave, there is a short easy hike to the reservoir with more rocks and more rock climbers. The Bear Gulch trail was an easy 2 hour hike and there are many families with small children on the trail.We saw some turkey vultures but didn’t see any condors. The park rangers are very helpful and explained how to identify the two species in the sky. The park ranger said entering through the West Entrance via King City is more scenic than the East Entrance. But there is no road run through the park, so you can not drive from East entrance to the West entrance.

The reservoir is usually very peaceful, and very nice to gaze at. We got kind of unconfused about whether we should turn back, or keep on going to get back to the parking lot. We went back through the caves, but it may have not been the right way. The only disappointment is that there are supposed to be condors, but we didn't see any.","April 3, 2014",Very Beautiful,30,"San Jose, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"The hiking trails are fun, easy and not physically intense. There are quite a few cave routes to go thru, my 9yr old and her older friends love it. Flashlights are a-must. The caves open up on the other side into a beautiful open reservoir, which has lots of open area and ledges to rest. Great side trip on our way back from the Vision Quest Ranch stay.","March 31, 2014",A gem out of nowhere!,57,"Palo Alto, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"This is a nice place to hike and get glimpses of condors. Rock climbers have known about this place for years. The reason this place is a National Park is because of the condor management and the rock formations. In terms of National Parks this place doesn't rate too high when compared with Yosemite, Sequoia, Redwoods, or even Lassen.Make sure to take a flashlight to go through the caves.","March 29, 2014",Nice place for hiking and viewing condors,84,Oregon,4
Pinnacles National Park,"How new is it? This National Park is so new that information on the parks website and some of the parks signs still call it a National Monument. On January 10, 2013 President Barack Obama signed into law legislation passed by Congress to redesignate the monument to a National Park. That's how new!We spent three days in Pinnacles. This isn't Yosemite or Yellowstone National Parks. There are no lodges, Glitter Gulches, buses or crowds. There isn't a large highway into either side of the park. There isn't a road that goes from one side of the park to the other. In a word, it's perfect.This is where people go to see California Condors, hike, rock climb, explore caves and just plain get away. The park's 16,000 acres are mostly wilderness, protecting flora and fauna found in few places outside the park. The most developed part of the park is on the East side. There is a visitors center, campground and picnic area. The Bear Gulch Nature Center is open seasonally as staff permits. It was closed during our visit.On our first day we hiked on the west side of the park on the Balconies Cliffs – Balconies Cave Trails and part of the Old Pinnacles Trail. Day two we drove over to the east side and hiked Condor Gulch – High Peaks Loop Trails. We met a number of photographers leaving their perches because the condors had left theirs. The condors are high fliers but they are fast too. According to the naturalists tracking their activities, they can fly to the coast in an hour. On this day we talked to some scientists radio tracking the birds. They told us that at that time, all the birds had left the park and they may or may not return before the day was out. On our way back to the car we took a little side trip to the reservoir then took the scramble through the Bear Gulch Caves. On day three our luck ran out on perfect hiking weather. This day we were back on the west side headed to the High Peaks Trail using the Juniper Canyon Trail. We could see the condors searching the area for tasty breakfast treats. We could also see that the weather was taking a turn. When we reached the High Peaks Trail the wind was howling and we could see a huge storm rolling up the valley. We decided it was time to turn back. We got to our car the same time as the rain. There is no doubt that as more people discover the park, better roads will be developed and amenities outside the park will appear. But now might be the best time to see Pinnacles before others find it and love it to death.","March 18, 2014",Our Newest National Park,498,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Pinnacles National Park,"This was our first time at PNM and we are already planning next year's trip to this park. We gathered with family & friends. We stayed in the park's RV campground. Bring the binoculars, because you will probably see the condors. We have a better appreciation for these animals since our visit to this park. Deer, wild turkeys, chipmunks and quail frequented our campground. On one hike, one of our members saw a very healthy bobcat. The hikes through the caves were awesome. Bats live in some of the caves. Take a scheduled hike with one of the very friendly rangers and you may encounter the bats. The trails are very well kept. This place is a rock climber's paradise, because there are sections of the park that are maintained for theses guys. If you're not into caves and/or rock climbing, there are miles of trails for every level of hikers.A couple of things to remember: Bring binoculars, water proof hiking shoes, nice camera/smart phone, quarters for the showers, no generators allowed in the RV park, check for fire conditions (camp fires), some cash (general store's ATM/Credit card system was ""down"" until 3pm), a pop-up canopy (shade is limited), and top-off your gas tank BEFORE you leave the Hollister area. There isn't any gas stations within 30 miles of this place. The tent and RV areas are patrolled regularly by the Park Rangers. Also the rangers advise the campers of the daily presentations they have in the outdoor amphitheater. This place was a great experience. Have fun.","March 17, 2014",Understated delight =),27,"Rohnert Park, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"My wife & discovered this national park just a few weeks ago while scouring Google Maps! An unsung hero locally, we loved our 3 day visit here. We spend a night in Soledad & one night in Salinas. We hiked 2 days from the west entrance side & one day from the east entrance side. We found the lack of major crowds appealing, and the rustic feel of the area, as opposed to the touristy feel of Yosemite and Yellowstone. We did the Balconies Cave trail from Chaparral one afternoon. The next day we went from Chaparral to the High Peaks. The 3rd day day from the other side of the park we did the Bear Gulch cave & reservoir. We took lots of water & our own food. We purchased trail guides from the visitors centers as well. The caves & rock formations are nice. We went from March 10-12 & wild flowers were not in full bloom, yet but we saw enough nature that we were satisfied & felt physically good.","March 13, 2014",Great unsung park in central California - good for short trips,328,"Fremont, California",5

It is a nice park, and due to time constraints I only drove up to the Bear Gulch Day Use Area, and hiked up the Condor Gulch Trail. It was quite hot and dry, but it was a nice hike. lots of little critters (skinks, ants, squirrels, various birds) can be encountered.","March 8, 2014",Just a quick visit,40,"Auckland Region, New Zealand",4
Pinnacles National Park,Fun to have a good hiking spot for kids so close to San Fran. We spied a few Condors during our hike; made it even more enjoyable. I gave it a slightly lower rating than most national parks because it feels more like a large state park than a national park.,"March 5, 2014","Nice, manageable size for a national park",72,"Sudbury, Massachusetts",4
Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles NP is one of the release sites for the endangered California Condor - the largest North American bird. Our original goal in visiting was to see the Condors with their 25 foot wingspans. We saw 3 on our first trip, and at least 7 on our second trip, (three of the 7 sightings were for the same bird). We went into the park through the West entrance near Soledad. The 20 mile trip is on a curvy road that is frequently one lane wide, but we had no problem at all. There were plenty of spots to pull over to allow the little bit of oncoming traffic to pass. We used the Balconies loop trail which is rated as moderate, and goes through a cave. We picked up flashlights on the way. However, once we got to the park, several other middle-age couples told us that the cave is not as easy to get through as the brochure states, and they recommended head lamps and an ability to do a little climbing in the dark. We decided to hike the trail to the cave entrance, and when we saw the size of the large boulders just inside the cave, we knew that for us, we had made the right decision. The parking lot for the trail has restrooms and a picnic area. The path is well-maintained dirt, with short wooden bridges over the stream beds that normally would have water in them. The rock formations looming overhead are beautiful, and everywhere we turned was unique and scenic. The path has some ups and downs, but they were fairy easy to negotiate and not steep. On our second visit, we chose to follow the loop up to the Balconies and head towards the other cave entrance. This path climbed up through the boulders, but was never steep. The switchbacks in the trail made for a pleasant climb both up and down, with no section that left us panting for breath. When we got to the highest point on the trail, ( about 1 mile from the parking lot) we stopped for lunch and looked over into the next canyon. Several groups passed us that completed the loop through the cave, not all of them were young and super-fit, and they said they had no problem with the cave. One group even had a little one in a backpack. I highly recommend taking time to visit Pinnacles and hike this short, fairly easy trail to experience the beauty of the canyon, the chaparral and the rock formations. The condors and many other birds living in the park are an extra bonus. We saw several types of jays, titmice, sparrows, wrens and the acorn woodpecker, as well as a road-runner crossing the road. For the more intrepid, there are numerous climbing walls maintained in the park, and several long trails - we did not use these.","January 31, 2014","We loved Pinnacles so much, we went back 5 days later",114,VA,5
Pinnacles National Park,"We had a wonderful time on our first and recent visit to Pinnacles National Park.We spent the night before in Pacific Grove, less than an hour drive from the park's west entrance. Perhaps the most surprising fact about the Pinnacles rock formations is they are the result of a volcano...one that erupted 200 miles to the south, near Lancaster CA. Because of constant slippage along the infamous San Andreas Fault, the original rock formation split and the westerly portion traveled north over millions of years. Amazing! We stopped at the west end visitors center, a new facility with a helpful staff and a short video about the park...great for orientation and history. We only did the Cave Trail...a fun experience and a bit of an adrenalin rush for a couple of seniors. The open part of the trail was mostly pretty level with one moderate uphill climb. The cave portion of the trail can be challenging, depending on your physical condition. First, a flashlight is a must...its 500' long and dark in some spots. Second, there is some rock scrambling to be done inside the cave, so if you're not entirely mobile, give it a second thought. Third, there are some narrow spots where we had to squeeze between boulders sideways, and where we had to crawl a short distance to to overhead boulders. Having a backpack on makes this awkward...you'll probably have to remove it and push or drag it along.One last thing, we saw a couple with a baby and small child headed to the cave. I don't recommend bringing a baby...a small child, maybe. I'd say 6 years-old minimum. Overall we really loved the place and will definitely return for other hikes. Its got lots of beautiful scenery and wildlife too. We were there in January...because we're in a drought, it was perfect weather. Be advised...when you're warned about the summer heat in the Pinnacles, take heed. It can get VERY hot. We would never visit that time of year. Do take the time to read about the geologic history of the area. Its interesting, informative, and gives you a better understanding of the rocky landscape around you.","January 22, 2014",Highly Recommend the Pinnacles...Our Newest national Park,33,"San Francisco, California",5

Pinnacles National Park,"We went to West Pinnacles. We parked in the overflow parking lot and hiked about a half mile to the Balconies Caves Trailhead, which was suitable for both a 6 year-old and a 76 year-old, around 2 miles round trip. This is a moderate trail. 76 year-old did not enter the caves as the path in the cave is dark and quite narrow, and you have to stoop way down to get under some of the rocks. You need a flashlight. Kids loved climbing on the rocks. Interesting Buckeye trees along the trail. Picnic tables and restroom at trailhead, though no shade. A very pleasant day trip in November. It would be too hot to go there in the summer.

Later as the trail narrowed as it wound through the rocks, we had a great time squeezing through rock wall pathways and climbing down into the caves. They say flashlights are mandatory, but take headlamps so you can have your hands free for rock scrambling.This trail is the easiest and there were lots of kids taking the trek as well.

To really appreciate pinnacles you gotta get out of your car and hike the high peaks trail from the west side.

I took a couple of the trails on a Sunday afternoon.They were well marked and the park was not all all crowded which made the experience more intimate.

Pinnacles National Park,"We have visited MANY National Parks over the years ( long before contributing reviews to Trip Advisor) so we were excited to see the new addition to the network. Pinnacles became one in 2013 after years as a National Monument. I realize there are many criteria that help decide NP status but we couldn't help but think there ought be more than a total of 70 or 80 miles of hiking trails , many of which overlap, which is true for this park. We elected not to make the drive to the East entrance due to the long drive ( more like 1 1/2 hours ) from the Soledad community which is near the West entrance.There is a CHANCE you might see a Condor there but many never spot one is what we were told. There ARE unique formations on the West side of the Park and a cave you can scramble up and through as part of a trail ( flashlight IS needed) , but really, if you are a distance hiker, a single day is more than enough . Another suggestion: If you plan on seeing both Yosemite and Pinnacles in the same trip, do Pinnacles first and not the other way around. Pinnacles may very well have left a stronger impression for us had it been the lead-in to our Yosemite time rather than the reverse.Everything pales next to Yosemite.Also, Spring when the wildflowers are in abundance would probably make Pinnacles stand out more. Know this: At the time of our visit, the West Pinnacles Visitor's Center was closed due to budget cuts on Tuesday's and Wednesday's.We saw no advance mention of this nor was anything said by the grumpy/disinterested Ranger ""B' whom we talked with on the Monday before our planned hike.

The road, while not a speedway by any stretch, is much better on the east side. Expect lots of curves and turns. There were very few people on a fall Friday.

There are several hiking trails of varying length with suggestions posted of difficulty and estimated time as well as distance. As always, the rangers are knowledgeable and helpful.There are two sides. Be sure to allow enough time to visit both. Note the numerous farms and vineyards through the Salinas Valley.

Pinnacles National Park,"This park was an interesting trip.We went their with my partner's father and wife. I had no idea what to expect from this place. We entered from the east side of the park and hiked to the balcony cave loop and back. Worth the tired legs for sure!!I wish I would have researched more about the formation of the park before going and then I would have appreciated some of it more. Bring plenty of water including keeping some on ice in your car. The park handout said our trek should have been 4-6 hours but we completed the hike to the cave/the cliff section of the balcony cave/back to old pinnacle campground parking in about three hours with a short snack break just outside the cave exit. If I did it again I would have done the cliff section first only so that we would have experienced the cool cave section afterwards before we trekked back to the car. We saw only a half dozen other groups on our Saturday day there including Boy Scouts, a father with his 3 kids age 5-12? Some serious backpackers and climbers and a cute elderly couple with their well worn walking sticks.I would say it is open to all fitness levels as long as you pace yourself. There were only a few very small sections of the cliff trail section that might give folks nervous about heights a hard time. Check the park website before you go because they do have times of the year where parts of the cave systems are shut because of bats.","October 24, 2013",Rugged. Variety of landscapes,10,,4

The park is small enough to hike most of the central trails of the park, and by itself shows the variety of the terrain. I had camped at the Park to get the early morning and evening opportunities to see the condors.

True, they were pinnacles, but they were so far in the distance that I found them of no interest. The extreme heat and dust did not help matters.

The Balconies Cave is not a long dark tunnel, but rather more of a very shaded rock scramble. You'll still want a flashlight or headlamp, though. It was lots of fun--expect to use your hands to help you navigate and wear appropriate footwear. We saw a few soaring birds, but we're pretty sure they were vultures, not condors. Also saw a few rock climbers finishing their climb as the sun was starting to set.

Pinnacles National Park,"This is a long drive to nowhere. At either entrance and I've been to both. The hiking is good when the temperature is cool. In the summer, prepare to die. There are some interesting rock formations probably from the fault zone, but it ain't no Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, etc. I would not drive out here from Ohio to visit this National Park. No lodge, no easy motel access, etc. You basically have to camp. They did build a new visitor center. One step above a good state park. Motels are in Soledad. There's a fun town if you are into prisons.The road, especially on the west entrance, is terrible. Barely two lanes at times. It's a state road so I doubt if they will ever fix it. You must choose wisely for the entrance you want since the two sides are not connected. West you can access eventually over the bad road from 101. The other entrance, East, is one heck of a long trek. And yes parking could be bad.I have seen a tarantula, but never a condor which is the main attraction. And rock climbing. But beware the heat. I ONLY go there in the winter or early spring. Like I said. Some nice long hikes up into the weird hills. Last time there I broke my leg. That was fun.That it's only $5 should tell you something. Really, the hiking is nice, but it is not a comfort place.

Pinnacles National Park,"On a recent road trip through CA, I decided to add our nation's newest national park to my stops. I made a reservation at the campground (east side), and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the fee was $26/night instead of $35+up at most CA state parks. I went in mid-July, and a reservation was far from necessary. There were very few people there, and there are plenty of camping spots. However, sites range from small to large, from totally secluded to totally exposed and from totally private to neighbors in your pocket. Here are some thoughts:49 - secluded, near water, some mid-day sun50 - small, private57 - secluded, shady61 - shady, private62 - semi-shady, private63 - medium, private, semi-shady64 - same as 6365 - small, sun, semi-private72 - horrible76 - small, sunny, semi-private, near water78 - teeny, sunny, exposed83 - small, shady, semi-privateIf you're looking for two sites next to each other:51+52 - but sunny and exposed to the road53,54,55 - right next to each other, shady but right next to the road58+59 - shady, private, big60 - near 59, shady, private but small66 (small)+67(big) - shady, private, near bathrooms68+69 - medium, private, sunny, near water70+71 - big, some sun, semi-private73+74 - small, exposed to road and some sun75+77 - big, semi-sunny, exposed79+81 - big, sunny exposed80+82 - shady, near water, but exposedI've missed a few, but you get the point. Based on reviews, I made a reservation for 49. It was very private and secluded (not near road or other sites), but my car would have been parked in the sun most of the day, so I switched to 59 which was completely shady, way off the road, and not too close to 58 and 60. Bathrooms were completely adequate - no pit toilets. I camp to get away from it all, but the campground does have a nice pool if you're into that sort of thing.The first day I did a 3-4 mile hike in the Bear Gulch Day Use area, including the cave and reservoir. The second day, I set out for a longer hike, and ended up doing the entire loop from east to west entrance and back again - about 11 miles, I think. Since that wasn't my intention when I set out that morning, I picked up the pace by running most of the second half so I wasn't on the trail too late. Trails are well-maintained and very runnable (is that a word?) if you like that sort of thing. I was hoping for a condor sighting, but was not so lucky.Don't be a dummy (like me): if you are traveling alone, TELL SOMEONE WHERE YOU ARE GOING, and let them know when you return. There's no cell reception, so try a park ranger or fellow camper, or leave a note on your car/tent. I goofed; big no-no. And I know better! I'm glad I didn't end up Between a Rock and a Hard Place. ;-)A word of caution: as others have said, Pinnacles really IS in the middle of nowhere, and Rte 25 (to enter from the east), although well maintained, is ~30 miles of no services, no people, next to no cars and little to no cell reception. I say this as a single woman who drives an older car ;-) Make sure you have what you need before heading down Rte 25, and make sure someone knows where you are (do you hear a theme here?) BEFORE you lose cell reception.And a shout out to all you rock climbers out there: Pinnacles is climber-friendly! As a former climber, I was thrilled to see official signage pointing out access trails to climbing routes. Thumbs up, Pinnacles!Though Pinnacles might not have the WOW-factor that other national parks have, I found the landscape, remote location and lack of tourists to be a breath of fresh air.

Pinnacles National Park,"At only 2 1/2 hours from San Francisco, Pinnacles National Park is a great day trip, but I think worth staying for a night or two as well. A single trail can take you from inside a cave to the peak of a pinnacle. I went on Labor Day, and was worried it would be overrun, but it was not at all. Met and chatted with a few very nice fellow hikers, but also got to spend a lot of time hiking quietly with a friend. We saw two coyotes, a rattlesnake, and many birds. I felt I really got far away from the City, even though it's relatively close. I am glad Pinnacles is now in the National Park system. There are longer loops with spectacular scenery, and there are shorter walks that families were enjoying wiht small kids. I would definitely go back here, and I would camp too. The campgrounds looked clean and well cared for, but very exposed to the sun. The staff at the visitors' center, where you pay your fee, was helpful and friendly. One hint, if you are driving from San Francisco - take hwy. 280 rather than 101. This holiday weekend it was so much less crowded that it was much faster. From behind Los Gatos there are backroads you can take almost all the way to the park, too, through farm and ranchland.

So while I was doing a PCH trip (from San Luis Obispo to Monterey and back), I decided to stop by the park.Since I only had 1.5-2 hours, the ranger suggested the Balconies Trail.If you're going to the Balconies Trail, there is a lengthy cave as part of the trail. YOU WILL NEED A FLASHLIGHT! The ranger station has some LED flashlights for sale - or you can save some money if you bring your own.Needless to say I'm not very good at directions, and ended up realizing (when I got near the peak) that I was on the Juniper Canyon and High Peaks trails. Oops. I only wish I had more time.The views are incredible. The road getting there can be a little nerve-wrecking since it's a one-lane road. But the experience of the hike and what you see as you go is worth the journey.As a HUGE plus, it's only $5 for admission. You can't beat that. I've already told all of my friends in the LA area that they need to take a drive up the 101 to hike at Pinnacles. You should go too.","August 26, 2013",On a whim.

Pinnacles National Park,"First of all, Pinnacles National Park is in the middle of nowhere about an hour and a half from Monterey. And it it HOT! We were there in July and Monterey measured 58 degrees F while Pinnacles went up to 95!!! The drive there is really dry, is hot, and just feels deserted and kind of sad. You definitely feel much better when you drive up onto the Pinnacles grounds.The visitor center is really small and the admission is pretty cheap (I think it was $5). Pinnacles just officially became a NP in January so I'm helping with the new title they are able to eventually update their Visitor's Center & displays. There just wasn't very much to it.There are also 2 entrances to the park. One on the east & one on the west. They do not connect. There are also 2 talus caves in the park and one or the other is frequently closed for bat season. The one near the east entrance was closed (the one we drove to).We made sure we had a lot of water cause as I said, it was like 95 degrees. We ended up doing the a 6-7 mile hike that oversaw the upper Balconies and went through the nearby cave. We were really worried about the heat but surprisingly, most of the hike was covered, relatively cool, and bearable. You just walk through rocks, and shrubbery, and trees (not forests of trees but just enough for cover) for a few miles before you get to the cave.The cave is really cool. You NEED a flashlight though we saw some other people struggling with a cell phone light and same some people turn bad beside they were not prepared. Make sure to bring the flashlight cause this was really fun. You weave through boulders and low ceilings and narrow rock walls. Very very cool and unlike any cave I've ever been in. And temperature wise it is really really cool. After the cave we did a loop through the upper Balconies. It is mainly a loop where you get to see really pretty and neat rock formations. This loop detour is a little less than a mile though definitely worth the detour. Took some great pictures up there.After that we got back to the beginning of the cave and walked backed a few miles back to the car. It was a really nice outdoor excursion that shockingly was bearable weatherwise. I would love to come back sometime and do a different course!","August 18, 2013",Lovely and Fun Hike!,158,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5
Pinnacles National Park,"My wife and I camped here for one night on the last week of July and found this place to be a hidden gem just a couple of hours away from the bay area.  Check in at the east gate visitor center/store was easy, staffs were very nice and efficient, the store had pretty good selection for the needs for camping. Campsite is pretty clean, has fire pit, table and food storage although campfires were prohibited due to extreme fire warning. Bathrooms are clean, there is a coin shower that takes 2 qtrs for 3 minutes, so I managed to finish with just a buck.  At night, I could actually see the Milky way with my bare eyes and that was awesome!!! It would have been better if there was no group of people play guitar and sing until midnight.. We did two short trails, Mosses spring-skyline loop on the east gate, and balconies loop on the west side. Both were beautiful, not too demanding. We loved the view and wildlife along the hike.  The bads- swimming pool in the campground looked green, not willing to dip my body in it.. try choosing private site, your neighbors can be pain in the butt when you're trying to sleep.. there is no road through the park. If you want to visit the other side, you have to make detour for 1.5 hours around the park via 146, 25 and highway 101. Overall, I think it is worth visiting before the park gets more crowded since this is the newest addition to the national park if US. I recommend visiting during the spring though. Summer can be very hot and dry in Pinnacles.","August 2, 2013",Beautiful environment and scenic trails across the park,3,"Orange County, California",5

Pinnacles National Park,"The park is named for the high crags visible as soon as you drive through the west entrance. They’re the remnants of a volcano that erupted 20+ million years ago. You have a couple of hiking options from the west entrance. Given that it was a hot day and we had limited time, we opted for the easy Balconies Trail, a 2.4-mile loop that climbs some 200 feet through chaparral, past the base of the Balconies Cliffs to the Balconies Cave and back to the parking lot.The cave was formed when boulders broke off and fell into the narrow canyon below. Some sections have openings that allow sunlight to penetrate, but much of the cave is totally enclosed and therefore dark as night, so you will not be able to make your way through without a flashlight. A headlamp is actually preferable, as you have to scramble through some spots, and having both hands free is a definite advantage.If you move at a good clip, you could do this trail in an hour or so. We took a bit longer as we bought the trail guide at the park entrance (just 75 cents) and stopped to read about the plants and rock formations we were passing and, of course, to take photos of the great views. If you follow the numbered plaques along the trail, you’ll have an easier route through the cave. The guide recommends entering near marker 15 of 18. There’s an option to enter the cave earlier (I think it was around marker 8), but that has you scrambling down rather than up, which looked more challenging, and it also creates a few logjams because there’s very little room to pass people going in the opposite direction.Wear decent shoes if you’re planning to hike the cave and take water with you; there’s none available on the trail, and it gets pretty hot in summer.","August 1, 2013","Scenic, easy hike",396,"Victoria, BC",4

Pinnacles National Park,"We went to Pinnacles for a two night weekend trip in mid-July. We came from the East entrance and stayed at the camp site. The camp sites cost $23 a night and you pay a $5/car fee (valid for 7 days). Make sure you reserve your tent sites online before you go!Pinnacles was a fantastic weekend getaway. In just our ""backyard"" of our camping grounds, we saw a variety of critters and birds including a raccoon, chipmunks and squirrels, woodpeckers, rabbits, condors, turkeys, turkey vultures, quails, deer,... We also heard coyotes late at night/early in the morning but never saw any.Pinnacles has two famous caves: Balconies Cave and Bear Gulch Cave. Bear Gulch was closed when we went to protect the bats that inhabit it. If you decide to hike on the Balconies Cave trail, make sure you park at the trail head earlier in the day because there is limited parking. The trail itself was very easy but make sure to bring a lot of water and wear sun screen and hats because it gets up to 91 degrees with limited shade and breeze. It took us around 3 hours to hike the whole loop (plus to eat our lunch). Another tip is that you need to bring a flashlight if you plan on going through the cave because it is pitch black in it. The caves may also be tricky for young children and seniors due to the lack of visibility, steep rocks and narrow spaces. If you are looking for a place to cool off, head for the outdoor swimming pool in the camp ground. It is perfect for a dip to cool off or to just sit under the shade. There are showers near the pool but they cost 50 cents.","July 23, 2013",A small gem of a national park,212,"Pensacola, Florida",4
Pinnacles National Park,"Looking for a hiking spot on our way from San Jose to LA my husband found this place. I have to confess to being a little freaked out, the road down there seems deserted and I honestly thought I was being followed by a serial killer haha. After a long one lane road trip past a few deserted ranches you reach a brand new pristine visitors center. We watched a short film on the area there, a must do before you go hiking. It was hot when we left, but after hiking in about a half a mile it cooled a bit. We did the balconies trail and went through the cave. It was so cool. It looks like a giants playground. One of the rocks looks like a dogs head and there is another that looks like a tug boat. The caves are fun. I am very afraid tights spots but it was worth it. You definitely need a flashlight. The course wasn't very hard, young kids would love it, mine did. It's nature's playground. The whole round trip was about 2.5 miles.","July 1, 2013",Little known treasure,26,"Ocala, Florida",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles is recently upgraded to a National Park. Love the special views, wonderful trails and nature. Our group, 2 boys(8 & 14), my husband and I, went there in June 2013. 2.5 hr drive from San Mateo, CA. We entered from the West entrance because the Balcony Cave is open. Not too crowded on a Saturday. Plenty of spaces left in parking lot. Easy trail for my kids. We needed to bent down in some place, and some section was narrow. We spent 2.5 hr to finish the Balcony Cave/Cliff trail. We took a few water breaks. The traffic near the cave is quite busy. Totally dark inside. We brought headlight and flashlight. You needed to go up and down stairs or rocks. But it is all the fun about! It's quite hot that day like 90 degree. Only 1/3 of the trail has shade. Wish to have more shade area/trees at the picnic area at the parking lot. It's too hot for lunch that day. Will be back in Fall, the cooler season. Will try to enter from Easy Entrance next time and do the other cave.

Pinnacles National Park,"yes, it is a bit ""out of the way"" but it is worth a visit...preferably not in the middle of the summer.spent 2 full days there. Hiked an easier trail the first day..the old pinnacle trail, thru the caves (no doubt, you need a flashlight) over the balcony cliff trail back to the car. We came in on the east side and spent 3 nights in Hollister...did not find any other lodging closer. The second day we started off on the condor gulch trail over the high peaks trail to the reservoir. That was a spectacular hike. Not easy, but not TERRIBLY strenuous. It was quite a sight walking in the pinnacles, and parts of it seemed like a Disney set. Steep, narrow area but there is a hand railing..not a hike for those under 10 years I would not think. The 4 of us are in our 60's (and don't like heights) and we did OK. The Condor Gulch hike would be rough on a day in the 90's...we did it at 80 degrees and it was not too bad.","June 12, 2013",better than i imagined...,121,santa rosa,5

Quite a climb to get there (900 feet) but quite doable and with several spots with amazing views. We got very good advise from the store; ie we were to expect significant heat on the way up (indeed we did, with no shade to protect us from a 110 degree fahrenheit sunblaze). Take lots of water as all manuals say, here you need it. The most stunning aspect is the shear size of fallen rocks and boulders, we felt like being in the land of the giants. The condors circling at the top were indeed impressive although I would not know them from other big predator birds.

Pinnacles National Park,"We visited Pinnacles National Park the weekend of June 1-2, 2013. Driving into the East entrance the amount of wildlife is immediately apparent. A flock of wild Turkeys greeted us along with Quail, Deer, Vultures, Ravens and more. The East entrance is where the Pinnacles campground is located along with a small store/Visitors center. Be sure to check the hours of the store/Visitors center as they are short on some days and unlike many of the larger Parks, they don't open at o'dark hundred. We will return to Pinnacles but next time, earlier in the year as it was hotter than we expected and the resulting hatch of ""insects"" in the campground area was more than we had prepared for...however, the insects are food for the large Townsend's bat population and numerous birds in the Park and there are ways to prep for them. The West entrance offers less hiking trails but more spectacular views and if you are camping at Pinnacles campground, DO NOT miss driving to the ""other side"" of the Park to see the spectacular rock formations. We particularly enjoyed that the Park is left very much in it's natural state and what engineering improvements there are are minimal impact improvements. Pinnacles is a gem and worth visiting: to make sure you enjoy your visit, do your research to make sure you enter through the proper entrance as the East and West entrances do not pass through the park, watch for snakes, know that your dog can't go on the trails with you so make arrangements for fido, bring insect repellant and if you are camping, a bug ""sticky"" strip you can put up to attract flying insects in your tent or RV.

The first day, we went on a hike up to the reservoir starting @ ~ 2pm from the East entrance. We were lucky it was fairly cool. The scenery of the final destination was a reward. The 2nd day, we still came through the East entrance but went to the Old Pinnacle trail to see the Balconies caves. A couple of things about the Balconies caves: 1. this hike was a lot harder but our kids loved the caves. 2. If you have bad knees, watch out ... going up is fine but my knees started hurting on the way down. 3. if you have kids on your back, getting through the caves might be difficult. The same might be said for small kids. I heard babies on their parents back crying at the entrance of the caves. 4. Make sure to bring plenty of water 5. weekends are packed !!! will be harder to find parking and we were there by 11 am on SatComing in spring also is great for wild flowers lovers. I was able to see so many variety of native flowers in bloom that I ended up getting the poster which list all the wild flowers found on my walk.

Pinnacles National Park,"When I approached Pinnacles, I thought I was just going to check it off my National Park list but it was more then I ever hoped! It has the coolest caves(produced by falling boulders) and the most fun high peak trail(no scaredy cats here). The only downfall? The crowds on the wknds. At times it felt more like Disneyworld but have hope! An early riser will have a peaceful walk upon rising with the sun. I had the high peaks trail all to myself until 9 am...those lazy campers always sleep in. I found the elusive california condor among the serene hike. I have a bird program that mimicks the sound and he was curious to check me out to make sure I wasnt a fellow bird. The campground was truly nice with a pool, although it was not in use and a shower house. The store personel were nice and helpful. Dont show up on a friday, like I did, to get a camp spot. It wont happen(even though I was lucky with one left). Make some time in the afternoon(before 4) to visit the family-run wineries.

Pinnacles National Park,"Date April 3rd to April 6 - Spring BreakWe had no trouble getting a campsite through Reserve America booking just several weeks in advance. We were tent camping. Lots of sites are jammed together but there are some that offer a lot of privacy. Being a family of 8 we were required to get two sites. One was in the jammed area and the other very tucked away. Sites 34, 35, and 37 offer some privacy as well as many of the sites in the 49 to 83 loop.We had two days of spectacular hiking seeing very few people and many varieties of wildflowers. No condors, though. Just vultures which we at first mistook for condors. This changed on Saturday. The parking lots at the trailheads were full by 9 A.M. We waited for the first shuttle bus. Went up to Bear Gulch and took a short hike, 2 miles RT, up Condor Gulch to the overlook. When we left the park at 2 P.M. there was a line of several dozen cars waiting to get into the parking lot at the visitor center. When one car left the parking lot another car was allowed in. I can't imagine what it was like going through the caves with so many people. We had them almost to ourselves on the weekdays.More on camping - there is an unheated pool that opens on April 1st. At the pool there are shower stalls in the men and women's restrooms. Two stalls in each. They require quarters to operate and about a buck fifty gets you maybe 5-7 minutes of luke warm water. We found the campground to be well maintained and the restrooms cleaned on a regular basis. On our last night there a Boy Scout Troop 93 ruined the solitude of the area. Why they were assigned to a family camping area I'll never understand. A caravan of cars and trucks rolled into the area about 9:30 P.M. well after when most everyone had retired for the night. We tried to go to sleep in our tent but the adults of the group had set up about 50 feet from our tent. At 11 P.M. when they showed no signs of turning off their bright lights and quieting down, they showed no regard for the fact that they were in an area where quiet time begins at 10 P.M., I got up, got dressed and approached these 6 to 8 men and asked them to turn in. They apologized, turned off their lights, and went to bed. The next morning, several of the adults apologized to me again. Why, though, were they assigned to a family area?

Pinnacles National Park,"if you don't want to read this whole review, here are my quick recommendations for this attraction.- Juniper Canyon trail to the top of the Pinnacles.- Do the loop of Bear Gulch Cave, see the Resevoir, and the Rim trail.- Balconies Cliff trail, making sure to go through the caves.- Bring flashlights and lots of water (even in the cooler months)My youngest son (13) and I wanted to check out the Pinnacles as a potential spot for a family weekend trip. Since we live less than three hours away, we went up without much planning. The GPS guided us to the West side, where we discovered that there was only day hikes (no camping). So we decided to do the trails on that side, and then drive around to the east side the next day.We started off on the Balconies Trail heading to the caves. It's a simple hike, and the caves are worth seeing, though you shouldn't expect them to be as spectacular as water carved caves.We also checked out the rock climbing faces of Machete Ridge for future climbing excursions (which I would probably prefer over the Monolith climbs on the east side, as it is nicely secluded)I wish we had taken time to do the Balconies Cliffs trail, but we wanted to make sure we had time to explore the High peaks, so we went up Juniper Canyon Trail, which is a lovely trail, full of panoramic views of the Pinnacles and other minor rock formations. it is a moderately strenuous hike (I don't know the gradient) but well worth the effort - just make sure you stop often to enjoy the views (and rest, if needed). The view from the top is beautiful. We went up the south side, intending to hike around the Pinnacles on the High Peaks trail and loop back through the Tunnel Trail, but we were enjoying our conversation and ended up going down the same trail we came up. My son wanted to see the tunnel, so at the Y, we went back up the trail to discover what was there. Surprisingly, the tunnel was only a hundred yards up, and my son had fun running back and forth through this man made path.We took a leisurely stroll back down the trail, and did some bouldering where it seemed like we wouldn't disturb the flora or fauna. For anyone who is within a few hours of this attraction, it would make a great day hike. Staying for sunset would probably be spectacular! Total hiking for the day was about 6 miles.The next day, we went to the East side. We were there on a Saturday, which was very busy (as was to be expected). We parked at the Visitor Center, and decided to hike all the way up and down - but that adds a number of miles to the trek. I would highly recommend that you try to find a parking place at one of the top lots, or take advantage of the shuttle from the Station, which seems to be about every fifteen minutes or so. I think a lot of people figured it wasn't worth the wait, not realizing that they had several extra miles of climbing uphill ahead of them.We started up the Bear Gulch trail, which was very pretty. if you parked at the visitor center and have any energy left after exploring the upper trails, then this is well worth hiking down at the end of the day, as the flora and fauna are significantly different that all the other trails.Once we arrived at the upper day use area, we started on the Moses Spring trail and continued up the Bear Gulch Cave trail. It really was fascinating to be in caves formed by falling rocks getting wedged in the narrow canyon. But be aware, all such caves are not very large, and there are numerous places you will have to scurry , duck or even crawl - but worth the effort!We stopped to view a number of rock climbers on the monolith, and then continued on to the reservoir, which is a beautiful little body of water, with lots of places all around for both young and old to explore. We continued on along the rim trail, which is definitely worth doing, as it gives you a great view of many of the lower rock formations.If you have small kids, this may be all you want to do on the East side, however, if you're adventurous and have the time, climbing all the way up to the High Peaks is well worth the effort. We went up this trail, and enjoyed the changing terrain. Once back at the top, we continued north along the High Peaks trail, which winds its way along the east side of the peaks. This is a spectacular trail - but be warned - the map says this has steep and narrow sections - and this is no exaggeration! I would highly recommend not doing this if you are an unstable climber (rely on walking poles) or have young children. We were very concerned about a couple with a four year old and infant in a backpack... there were a number of places that the child could have easily fallen very far - steep trails under overhangs with the handrail above the child's head. As well as places where the parent had to lean the child backpack over the handrail to avoid getting stuck on the rock overhangs (in fact, they had to remove the backpack to make it through - very dangerous on a ledge that is literally only two feet wide). if you are afraid of heights, this trail is not for you.However, if you are fit and in decent shape, this is a beautiful section of trail, and affords you views and access to a number of spectacular pinnacles that you won't be able to experience elsewhere in the park. We climbed a number of them that were awesome, and discovered some neat crags that were home to a number of bird nests (crows and vultures - not condors).We continued along the northern part of the High Peaks trail, and decided to continue down that instead of taking the Condor Gulch trail. In hindsight, I would have probably chosen Condor Gulch, as the upper portion of the High Peaks trail is really along the back side of some hills, with no significant views of the pinnacles or other interesting rock formations (more like any other hike in the foothills). The only redeeming aspect of that particular trail was that it did round out the pallet of different flora and fauna available in this Park, and was an interesting change of pace.And of course, we rounded out the hike by going down the Bench Trail back to the visitor center. This ended up being about 11.5 miles of hiking.On a future trip, we will likely do the old Pinnacle Trail, just to see what it's like. For the adventurous hiker, I might recommend starting on the east side, doing the Bear Gulch trail, follow the Rim trail to take you up to the High Peaks, go down the Juniper Canyon trail on the West side, head over to the Balconies (Cliffs and Caves) and then meander back around the Old Pinnacles trail back to the campgrounds.Like many places, spring is probably the best time to visit due to comfortable temperatures and blooming flowers. We will probably make this an annual visit - and maybe more often for rock climbing.","April 8, 2013",Beautiful Hikes,35,"Santa Barbara, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Experiencing Pinnacles National Park during a weekend in spring beak was not good planning because of the groups and crowds. After reading my Trip Advisor, we knew we had to arrive fairly early in order to park near the trailhead to Bear Gulch, bring water, snack, and flashlight. The trail through the caves to the reservoir was beautiful, mostly shaded, but had some narrow crevices to scramble through and under all while holding your flashlight. I would recommend a small backpack or camelback, if at all, since it does make squeezing between and under the rocks more difficult. The narrow stairs leading up to the reservoir left my legs weak. Luckily we were not in a rush to return and sat down on some rocks to enjoy the sights. This was our least enjoyable time, as the groups were busy yelling to each other instead of respecting. Mother Nature and allowing the rest of us some tranquility. With darker clouds looming we hiked back to our car and completed the Junior Ranger worksheet before our son was sworn in officially. With budget cuts threatening park cut backs and closures, this is really something to see. I am so glad we did. I highly recommend a trip, even without seeing the condors!

We did a small part of the Condor Peak trail in the afternoon- but it was getting hot.","March 14, 2013",Beautiful,26,"San Jose, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,This is a lovely park and so close to San Francisco! We went in Feb and the weather was really nice - I have heard that it is very hot in the summer and so I would visit this park in the winter if you can since there is so much to do anyway in the summer! Don;t miss a hike though one of the caves here - they are really narrow canyons where the top of the canyon has been blocked off by falling rocks. Can get really dark - make sure that you have a flashlight. Kids will love scrambling up the rocks. Parking is tough so come either early morning or late afternoon. Make sure you bring enough food and water for the day.,"March 14, 2013",Great Park!,9,"Fremont, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,Great park for hiking provided the weather is not too hot. The Balconies hike and the High Peaks Loop are both great as are the Bear Gulch caves. It can get really hot in the summer and I did encounter a rather aggressive rattlesnake several years ago. There isn't much shade either so a hat might be helpful. Springtime tends to have lots of wildflowers. This is probably the best time to go. Another consideration is the Bear Gulch Caves which are broken into 2 parts. They are usually partially closed so as not to disturb the bat population. It's nice to go when both parts are open but this is not very often.

Pinnacles National Park,"Get there before too many people realize it is a national park. Lots of room in Winter. But, It is crazy busy there any other time of year. With the upgrade to National Park, the limited facilities are going to be taxed even more. They will get more money as a NP, But it will take them years to catch up to the increased crowds. They already have to do shuttles around the park now. I am afraid this park is going to get ""loved to death"".","March 9, 2013",California's Newest National Park,110,Los Banos,5

It is a unique place that was set aside by Teddy Roosevelt. We walked the Balconies Trail and found it beautiful. We did not go thru the caves part because it was dark and rocky but we completed the trail by walking to each end of the cave instead of a loop. Beautiful views and blooming wildflowers on this well maintained trail.Free or $5.00 if you don't have a senior National park pass.

Pinnacles National Park,"Both the Balconies Trail Loop (70-90 minutes; bring a flashlight) and the High Peaks Trail Loop (2-3 hours; bring water) are outstanding hikes that can both be done in a single afternoon. These hikes are among the best that California has to offer and comparable to many elsewhere in America and Europe (Yosemite, Columbia Gorges, Grand Canyon, Cathar Trail, etc.). But beware, you must be fit to do them and not afraid of heights or darkness! Especially good when the weather is dry, but not hot.

Pinnacles National Park,"This national park is definitely worth a visit for its trail, hike and picturesque views. I visited the NP from the west side and did the short hike to the Balconies cave. Some advise to potential visitors: The hike through the cave is not as easy as it sounds on the NP's website. You surely need a flashlight and one small mis-step here or there will land you in trouble, since you are practically hiking on rocks. When you follow the trail, from Chaparral ranger station, you will come at a junction after about half the distance. Since the balconies cave trial is a loop, I recommend making a left there so that you 'climb up' in the caves, instead of 'climbing down'.. Also, the rocks may be wet due to the water stream. One more thing I noticed.. visit the westside if you are going in the evenings, and the east side if in the mornings.. the rays of the sun will turn the volcanic rock into gold ! :) Enjoy :)","February 23, 2013",Definitely worth it !,10,"Los Angeles, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We entered the park from the east side and did the high peaks loop as a day trip on a February weekend. Very enjoyable! We also did the short hike to the bear gulch caves. On the top of the peaks, some condors came up close to us, close enough to hear and feel the wind from their giant wings. The views and the rock formations were really nice -- enormous blobs of ancient lava oozing out of the ground. We also saw some California quail. There were more people than I was expecting, but it was still peaceful. Highly recommended trip!","February 4, 2013",Pinnacles rocks!,29,"sacramento, california",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Now a National Park the Pinnacles is a wonderful, scenic, clean, and very worthwhile day use NP. I hiked the Balconies Cliffs trail (moderate) and the High Peak trail (strenuous) in the same day. The landscape is scenic of an extinct volcanic eruption. Scientists have determined the rocks came from a separation of the San Andreas fault some 160 miles to the south. The trails are well marked with carabiner markings indicating rock climbing opportunities. The west entrance and east entrance are not linked by road. The Balconies caves are very exciting and a demanding climb in and out of. The is a beautiful and very worthwhile NP to visit.","January 26, 2013",Pinnacles (West),6,,5

The most striking thing about the park is the geological difference to the surrounding hills. Nice hiking trails with awesome views of an ancient volcano eruption. We went during the week and there were only a few others on the trails. Lots of picnic benches and a nice new park entrance building with small gift shop and clean bathrooms.

Pinnacles National Park,"Pinnacles National Monument is scheduled to become the next National Park. If you normally do not take the path less traveled, I would make an exception to see the Pinnacles Park. It is a day trip from Monterey or Santa Cruz. There is camping and room for trailers, although we did a day trip. There is a very small store at the visitor's center selling mostly snacks. The nearest large store is in about 40 miles away so bring your picnic or camping food with you. The Pinnacles is noted for its natural beauty and the caves found in two different locations in the park. We hiked the Reservoir Trail through a set of caves made with huge rocks filling the canyon. The trail was well maintained and easy to follow. The hiking part of the trail takes about an hour. You will need to add in extra time to play and explore the caves. You do need to bring a flashlight and the path inside the caves can be slippery due to a creek and standing water. Pinnacles is also the home of the California Condor. These beautiful birds with their large wing span can be seen drifting on air currents above the hills on warm sunny days. My vision of the Pinnacles is a dry hot place and in summer the temperatures do get hot. However, you can also visit in the winter. There has been a cold spell this winter in California and the Pinnacles reflects the temperature in nearby areas. We needed jackets, hats, and gloves while hiking as the temperature was in the low 50's during the day. If you want a unique view of California, enjoy a hike in the caves at the Pinnacles.","January 21, 2013",Enjoy hiking in the caves,91,"San Jose, California",4
Pinnacles National Park,"I did go through part of the caves, but had to turn back because of my lack of leg strength - lots of ups and downs!

The choice of the hike was obvious ~the Bear Gulch Cave trail. The ranger told us the hike will take two hours, which is a conservative estimate. We drove by the day use area and parked the car in the end c-d-s/parking. The trail was gorgeous!! We didn’t expect the hike though the cave to be so breathtaking! Never saw/hike anything like this.

Pinnacles National Park,"Geologically speaking, this park has a lot to offer: the ragged shape of the pinnacles (up-faulted slabs of rock); huge boulders that have fallen off the ridges, an intermittent stream, and very good explanations of what you are seeing (i.e., signage).There are multiple levels of difficulty in the trails. We took the tamest trail on the west side. Difficult trails and serious climbing routes are options in both the eastern and western sectors of the park. There are also plenty of small birds, and some condors (but they are far above you).The west visitors center has a new video that explains what you can see and the origin of the features.","October 31, 2012",A lazy walk through scary landscape,268,"Ottawa, Canada",4

It is a very underrated park for the most part and I seriously recommend visiting, when we went the wildflowers were in bloom and it was just INCREDIBLE.

The opposite side of the park entered through Soledad is the more adventurous side of the park where there are caves.

After a little driving in the park I checked out the map and decided to park at the end of the road and take the Moses Spring Trail to the Bear Gulch Cave Trail. After going through the caves, I took Rim Trail back to the parking lot. Except for a small group of oblivious kids sitting on the trail eating their lunches, I had a good time.

The caves were awesome. The children thoroughly enjoyed climbing up and down the rocks. The best part is we could do this on a regular weekend with very minimal driving (~80 miles from Bay Area). If you are planning to camp out here, please be sure to bring some shade (patio umbrella etc). If you are specifically looking for campsite info, we stayed at 79/81/83. Out of these 83 was the only one that had a decent amount of shade. but 79/81 are HUGE campsites so you have a lot of space to move around.

Pinnacles National Park,"We went on August 10 and it was very hot. In the morning around 10am, we went to the Bear Bulch Cave from the east entrance. The park function on an honor system, so you pay the park fees at the visitor's center. There is a restroom facility at the parking lot where the Bear Gulch trail starts. The hike was not far (less than one mile for sure) and when we got to the cave, it felt like it had air conditioning!! We didn't want to get out. The upper half of the cave was blocked off though because bats are still hybernating in there. There are concrete steps inside the cave. The cave itself was nothing spectacular; just more like a vertical cave where you see a little bit of water. We didn't get our shoes wet at all, but I think that's because we went in the summer. We drove back to King City for lunch and went to Balconies Cave (west entrance) in the afternoon. There is a brand new visitor's center at this entrance. Since we've already paid the admission when we went in throught the east entrance, we didn't have to pay again. (I think the ranger drives around the parking lots to check if you have the receipt taped to your window). You need to take the road going to the Balconies Cave trail all the way to the end where there is a parking lot. I can't remember if there was a permanent restroom there or porta-potties....I am leaning towards porta-potties. The hike was also less than one mile, and the Balconies Cave did not feel air-conditioned like the other one. However, I found this cave more interesting. There are many huge rocks (some very round) which have fallen from above and have gotten stuck, forming the talus cave. Some portions of this cave are quite dark, so you should have a flashlight. At a couple of spots, you really have to climb up/down by stepping on rocks. The climbs are short though, probably less than 8 feet. We did not encounter any bugs or insects or snakes inside the cave. The cave is not long, just right for little adventurers. If you have an agile kid, I think an 8 yr. old will do fine, but make sure it's the dry season. Some of the rocks can get pretty slippery if wet. From King City, both entrances are a little bit over an hour away. You cannot drive from one entrance to the other....but you can hike across (they say it'll take you a few to several hours). If you want to visit both entrances, I think King City is the best place to stop for a bite to eat. There are no restaurants at the park. At the east entrance, two people manned the visitor's center; at the west entrance, one person manned the visitor's center. Oh, and there is no cell phone reception for T-Mobile or Verizon at the park. However, I was told that along the road before you turn into the east visitor's center, there is reception for another carrier...maybe AT&T?","September 4, 2012",Nice short visit,27,"West Covina, California",4

It was HOT - 112º, but stunningly beautiful. We went through 4 liters of water in the same amount of time we would normally drink 1 liter back home. Best of all, there was no one there (a Thursday and Friday in August)...my husband says that's because no one is crazy enough to hike in that kind of heat, but that's beside the point. The second day, we did both of the cave hikes and loved it. I'm not always so keen on caves, but these weren't the claustrophobic kind. You still need a flashlight, though, so come prepared (the campground store was only open from 3:00-5:00 when we were there and the nearest town is 30 miles away). The campground was clean and lovely. We managed to pick a nice shady site. I was thrilled that the campground even had a pool - I've never seen that at a National Park before.

Along with a friend I did the short hike to Bear Gulch Reservoir. This was a relative easy and short hike but quite unique. It goes through some caves and covered rock formations for nearly half the duration. These caves have little or no natural light for short periods. You can do the hike without a flashlight but in some cases you won't see what you are walking. A smartphone that can use the flash as a flashlight is enough to do the job. Going through those caves is amazing. At points you have to squeeze through some narrow spaces. There's water roaring around. There are beams of light coming through the rocks.Very interesting. At the end of the hike you are rewarded with a views of the reservoir, a small lake.There were many people doing rock climbing, there's wildlife and there are very interesting rock formations.

Lots of blooming flowers and water in the creeks, though we didn't see any Condors like we did when we went in June... It was really really hot in June with millions of annoying little flies, and I imagine it only gets worse as the summer sets in. However, we went mid-week, had the place to ourselves and watched deer, wild turkeys, rabbits and a variety of birds from our camp site. Great diverse landscape with amazing rock formations, it's hard to believe it's only 2 1/2 hours from San Francisco. The campgrounds aren't bad, not very private, but there are flush toilets and things are kept really clean. They also have a pool - which is great if you have kids. Make sure and get up on the High Peaks trail - that's where we got buzzed by condors - I recommend sturdy shoes, boots if you have them. The reservoir is a short hike for those less ambitious and is also worth a look, the caves are cool, dicey if you are claustrophobic since there's a bit of scrambling to be done - take your own light source, there aren't any in caves otherwise.","April 18, 2012",Great Hiking experience / lots of wild life,79,"Pacifica, CA",4

Thirty miles from the nearest accommodations; we tented in the well-kept campground, a small drive-up space nicely tucked up against the rolling foothills. It was high fire season, so we missed having a campfire, but otherwise it was a lovely, quiet night. Two sets of meandering caves are the big draw here, but there are tons of other scenic, well-marked trials and although we are not rock climbers, the climbing looked fantastic and we got in our share of boulder-hopping. I get the idea that the summer might be pretty crowded and hot, but for an autumn weekday get-away, we couldn't have asked for more.

As a bonus, if you come in the East side, the drive on highway 25 is very nice. From the East, the hike to High Peaks is longer but there's an easier hike to the reservoir and you might get to go through the talus caves if they are open. Leave the strollers in the car.","October 24, 2011",Walk amongst great rock formations - and it's close to the bay area,140,"Santa Cruz, CA",5
Pinnacles National Park,"We made it to the campsite in our regular spring, short sleeved shirts and hiking shorts. We had no idea that it would drop below freezing that night! We were able to stay warm, but next time we will be ready.","October 15, 2011",Take your warm gear in the spring.,58,"Edmond, Oklahoma",3

Pinnacles National Park,"We spent a full day at this park. It has amazing talus caves (Balconies cave) that the kids loved to explore. The caves and the area around them are shaded and cool (even in the hot summer). You need a flashlight.The high peaks trail has beautiful views (when not cloudy), but the uphill can be hard when it is hot. It is not too hard for kids ~5 years and up.The kids loved the Tunnel trail (no flashlight needed).More info at http://www.nps.gov/pinn/index.htm","September 2, 2011",Beautiful place. Good day trip with kids,19,"Davis, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"My son and I entered Pinnacles through the west entrance and climbed up to the top where we could see miles and miles in all directions. On the way up, the hike meanders thru trees and grasses and is quite pleasing. Toward the top, there are huge boulders and steps with rails. It was like an obstacle type course climbing all around along the ridge. We passed a group of excited Boy Scouts who each found a high spot to sit and eat lunch. We hiked down toward the east through meadows that are supposed to be impressive with wildflowers in the Spring. At the bottom we joined up with the trail to the bat caves along a stream. And then we found the caves and donned our headlamps. It was DARK inside with painted white arrows on the walls to point the way. There were two sets of short caves that were a BLAST. We noticed that some hikers just parked and hiked over to the caves and back. You are really missing the whole enchilada if you don't hike the ridge with the steps and railings. This park is not spectacular like Yosemite or Zion, but is its own secluded little odd place great for families and little adventurers. We arrived around 9 and hiked about 8 miles. Unforgettable","August 11, 2011",A great playground,71,California,4
Pinnacles National Park,"About an hour drive from Monterey CA. (we went on a rainy day) $5 admission which is totally worth it and supports the park so just do it. We got there later in the day, about 3pm, so we just wanted to do a short hike. We were advised that hiking the caves was ""at your own risk"" as they were flooded with water so we figured we would just go check it out. The hike up Bear Gulch Caves Trail (easy to moderate) was beautiful! Moss covered trees and rocks made the area look like a fairy forest! The peaks were beautiful with the sun behind them and the waterfalls were fun to photograph. The weather didn't keep people off the trails, we saw others on opposite peaks and got a ""woo hoo"" from encouraging onlookers as we started into the caves. The water was definetely flowing, I think this may be the ""rainy season"". We took our time and made sure each step was sure and made our way through one of the most exciting and fun hikes ever! You HAVE to have a flashlight or head lamp in order to see in the caves and if you go in March during the rains like we did be sure to have a change of clothes in the car! We couldn't keep the smiles off our face as we trudged through ankle, knee and one final thigh high deep walkway of running water! A high five at the end under a strong waterfall and we hiked down past 2 waterfalls and several great spots for photos. Will be back when we have more time to explore more of this lovely park!","March 26, 2011",A must see hiking experience,44,"Santa Maria, California",5
Pinnacles National Park,"Our family of 4 including a 10-yr-old boy and 6-yr-old girl went camping for 2 nights at Pinnacles National Monument over the long Columbus Day weekend. The last stretch of Hwy 25 before the turn into Pinnacles was windy and my 10-yr-old, who is prone to motion sickness, started to feel sick in the last 2 miles. CAMPGROUNDThe campground was better than I'd expected from reviews on yelp. Definitely research the campsites online or get there early to choose a decent one. Many are in a wide open area with no privacy or shade. Loop C, the section we stayed in, had a good amount of shaded and foliage-separated areas. It also wasn't very full, so I suspect that made a big difference in our experience. Try to get there well before 5pm so you can drive through and possibly switch campsites or choose a campsite in conjunction with the campground office. The signs for open sites said ""One Night Only"" and then something to the effect of ""If you want to stay longer, please check with the campground office."" We'd reserved site 82, which was okay but not ideal, but since we got there after 5pm, we didn't want to go through the hassle of switching our campsite and then finding out the next day that we couldn't stay there more than that one night. Our campsite had a raccoon bin and a water spigot, but not all sites did.If you go in October, be sure to bring bug nets for your food, and anything else you use for bugs (repellent, citronella, canopy with bug netting, whatever). There were way too many deer flies and yellow jackets. Apparently, the yellow jackets like the live oak trees at this time of year (but they like your sweets and meat even better) - more than one of us ate a meal or two in the car to avoid the yellow jackets and deer flies.The evening campground ranger slideshow program on the California condor recovery was VERY interesting, and I highly recommend it.From our tent at night and in the early morning we heard quails, woodpeckers, owls, wild pigs(?), crickets, and a myriad of birdcalls I can't identify. Bathrooms were very clean and well maintained. We didn't use the showers, which were in a different building.THE PARK/NATIONAL MONUMENTOur kids LOVE national parks and monuments and CA state parks, because they really get into earning their junior ranger badges. Pinnacles did not disappoint. The rangers were very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. The visitor center also has an adventure pack you can borrow, which we did. It had a compass, lots of identification sheets for plants, animals, butterflies, a nature journal, binoculars, a bug box, a magnifying glass, and more.Call before you go to see if they'll allow campfires. The NPS website said no, but when we got there, we found out they'd just lifted the ban 2 days earlier! We were able to buy wood from the campground store.Also, check the weather forecast. It can get REALLY hot there.We did the Moses Spring-Rim Trail loop through the Bear Gulch Cave, which was fully open. BRING YOUR OWN FLASHLIGHTS AND LOTS OF DRINKING WATER! We started out about 2pm. Some early hikers were leaving, and we got very lucky to get a parking spot right at the trailhead. It's a 2.2 mile hike that went past a ladybug hangout, into a pitch black bat cave, past a reservoir, past many rock climbing sites (with rock climbers in action), past manzanita trees and others we didn't identify. The hike was so cool that the kids wanted to do it again the next day -- the cave was the highlight for them.While at the park, we had 3 live tarantula sightings. One was walking across our campsite, no less -- the ranger said it was mating season and the male tarantulas were on the prowl. The children caught a young horned lizard and a very young blue-bellied lizard that they looked at and then let go. On the hike we saw a dentate stick beetle, and we think we saw an endangered CA condor soaring in the distance. We also saw a peregrine falcon, several rabbits, and a gopher (?) snake.We will definitely be going back, probably to the west side of the national monument next time. (There is no through road, and it's a 1.5-hr drive around.)","October 12, 2010",Well worth the trip but research and plan ahead of time,19,"Alameda, California",4

Pinnacles National Park,"A friend told me years ago that it's a good idea to stop at national parks/monuments/etc. because something designated as a national treasure is generally worth seeing. I've traveled a lot, and stopped at lots of national entities, and generally found that to be good advice. This is one of those exceptions. I understand that this is a good rock-climbing park, but I'm not a rock-climber. If you're looking for a place to hike, this might be a good choice. But it ain't anything spectacular. Good thing it wasn't a very long drive. (I went to the west entrance; maybe it's more exciting at the east entrance.)","June 30, 2010",Ain't Anything Spectacular,9,"Texas, USA",2
Pinnacles National Park,"I have now been to the Pinnacles over a dozen times. My goal has been to see a California Condor. I think I am the only person with that many visits, that has not seen one. Yes I already wear glasses. The trails offer everything from flat easy to heart pounding that makes your hair bounce. Bring at least a 1/2 gallon of H2O per person. Wear a full brimed hat, a small flashlight for the caves. Binoculars and a camera if your willing to carry the extra weight. Walking sticks are helpful and reassuring. Before you go learn your scat it's nice to know who you are sharing the trail with. Enjoy and I hope you see more condors than I have. Oh, Be warned, the roads leading to both the East side and west side are a bit windy getting to the park. And definety check the forecast for the pinnacles not some nearby city like gonzales, big difference.","July 23, 2009",Bring your hiking shoes,39,"Morgan Hill, Ca",4
Pinnacles National Park,"I stopped at West Pinnacles (near Soledad CA) during a road trip down 101. There are 2 entrances to the park, but you can only hike between them - not drive. The rock formations are beautiful. There are also caves to explore, but I didn't have a flashlight. The sunset glows off of the pinnacles - take a camera! Park entrance is $5 and is good for 7 days.","September 4, 2006",Beautiful Park of 101,268,Maryland,5
