Denali,Visiting Denali was a dream come true. Such interesting sights to see. We were on a bus that we entered the park in very early in the day in hopes of seeing lots of wildlife. We weren’t disappointed. It was a bit cloudy at Denali and our guide said there were snow showers coming down. Just our luck. It was still beautiful!,"October 11, 2019",Breathtaking !,154,"Salisbury, North Carolina",5
Denali,My wife and I recently visited Denali with friends while on a cruise tour in Alaska. We stayed at the Denali Princess Lodge. We took the Tundra Wilderness Tour and were lucky to be in the 30% of people to actually see the mountain when it wasn’t covered by clouds. We also were able to see it again while staying at the Mt McKinley Princess Lodge. The views of this spectacular attraction are breathtaking. A must see in Alaska.,"October 10, 2019",Visit to Denali,128,"Turnersville, New Jersey",4
Denali,We were so lucky to see the mountain on a clear and sunny day. We had great views of the north side while on the park and even better views of the south side while driving back to Anchorage. It is a giant and dwarfs the surrounding mountains.,"October 10, 2019",Amazing!,104,"San Diego, California",4
Denali,Got to see full mountain a couple of times. First viewing from Telkeetna hotel was like a movie whatever big thecmo7ntain unfold from deck or picture windows. Just breath taking,"October 8, 2019",Denali in all her splender,7,,5
Denali,We did the Interpretive Kantishna bus and greatly disappointed partially due to our bus driver from Maryland area. Save yourself some money and book one of the Transit buses. Beautiful views and wildlife. Be sure to check out the Dog Kennels and great views at the Denali View South rest area too. Remember the first 15 miles are free access with your personal vehicle and you will see moose.,"October 5, 2019",Book a Non-Narrative Transit Bus,667,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Denali,"We took a bus trip through the park. We saw bears, moose and other wildlife. Although we enjoyed the trip, it was much too long. About seven hours for the hole trip. Find a shorter trip.","October 4, 2019",Beautiful Park,0,"Macomb, Michigan",5
Denali,"I really had very high expectations based upon all that I had heard but to be honest it was a little disappointing. Having been to Yellowstone, the Grand Tetons, Yosemite, Rocky Mountain National Park, the Redwoods, King Canyon and others I expected more. Very little wildlife close to the road. Denali is so far in the distance that it looks like the foothills around Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico. The park is massive, I know it is not for us humans but for the wildlife whether animal or vegetation. We did the bus tour, so we got as close to all areas as we could.","October 3, 2019",Not What I expected.,71,"Parker, Colorado",4
Denali,"The only way to ride through the park is via tour bus. Our Tundra Tour guide was excellent and very knowledgeable about the park, history and wildlife. We saw lots of grizzly bears, moose, Dahl sheep, caribou and birds. The bears were very busy eating berries in preparation for winter. The scenery is amazing. They are often hidden by clouds, but we were able to see all the peaks during our stay.","October 3, 2019",Tundra tour was excellent,18,"Canton, Ohio",5
Denali,"After travelling such I long way with such high expectations, I have to say I was pretty disappointed with what we found here. I’m not saying it wasn’t nice, and we enjoyed the couple of walks, but access is so restricted and we weren’t able to get a place on any of the tours. The place was so desolate, I was quite surprised. I’m afraid the National parks in Australia and even New Zealand are far better.","October 2, 2019",Not what I was hoping for,100,"Campbelltown, Australia",3
Denali,Early morning starts are required if you hope to see any animals although being wild you will be lucky to see them from a very far distance and would suggest taking strong binoculars or cameras with at least a 50 zoom. Enjoyable day travelling around looking at scenery.,"September 30, 2019",Interesting day out,1,,3
Denali,"Denali being just a few hours away from northern most point in usa and one of the tallest peak , we feel reaching there should be tough . It is not . Journey is long but beautiful. And tundra vegetation due to 8 months of snow is sparse . But the dedication of staff and people maintaining park and ecological balance is something absolutely amazing. The respect and love for nature is so mesmerising, we feel we have been robbing nature of its own wealth and life all along . It inspires us to do more for conservation of our on world . The dedication towards the animals there , the flora and fauna to even mosquitoes, yes they are one who bring ecological balance by pollination of berries . It is just something we all need to learn from . Worth a visit atleast once in life . Caution. Journey is long . So best is break journeys . Which while coming back to India we didn’t do .The beauty of Denali is raw and prestine .","September 26, 2019",A very different experience. Denali is really majestic.,24,"Mumbai, India",5
Denali,"Have seen Denali head to toe without a cloud in the sky. Have not seen Denali at all due to clouds. Your trip into Denali via School Bus could be a Super Experience or a Bust. You should see some wildlife. Grizzlies are possible, caribou are probable. The School Bus ride is worth your time. The scenery is spectacular. Luck can make it a life experience.","September 26, 2019",Will you be super lucky,76,"West Chicago, Illinois",5
Denali,Our guide got very excited when she realised we would be able to see all of Denali as normally part of it is covered by cloud I have managed to get a fantastic photograph of the montain which was as well because the next day when we were nearer it was shrouded in mist.,"September 26, 2019",No clouds!,18,stoke,5
Denali,"The downside is you have to take the tour on a modified school bus for 9 hours. The upside is the scenery and the wildlife! 18Brown bears? 20 moose, 9 Dahl sheep, elk and others it was great not to miss!","September 24, 2019",One of our lifetime Trips!,39,"Georgetown, Canada",5
Denali,"We were extremely impressed with the snow covered mountains, the nature and the wildlife throughout our 30 mile bus tour. The bus driver did an excellent job in describing the history of Denali as well as the wildlife that exists throughout the park. We were fortunate to see several bald eagles and one bear (although at a distance).We highly recommend this bus tour even though it was a little chilly in Sept. Overall, a very good experience.","September 24, 2019",Spectular scenery throughout the park,216,"Boylston, Massachusetts",5
Denali,I travelled throughout Alaska and Denali was a great stop. I saw plenary of wildlife and even a glimpse of the mysterious mount Denali on a clear day!,"September 21, 2019",Incredible nature!,1,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5
Denali,I recommend everyone try to go to Alaska if you can. The park is beautiful! For myself and my husband it was a life changing experience and we're so glad we did it!,"September 20, 2019",Breathtaking!!!,10,"Long Island, New York",5
Denali,"We were in Denali for three days staying outside the park. The weather was terrible very wet and misty, never even saw the mountain - don't care this is in the true sense of the word awesome. Day one we just parked up at the visitor centre and walked the local loop trails, easy walking and well signposted. Day two took the transit bus to Elison visitor centre saw bears, moose, caribou and some mean and misty scenery. Driver was great and although not the wildlife tour stopped plenty of times for wildlife viewing, you just don't get a commentary. Takes a few hours but plenty of rest stops (you need to take your own food and drinks). Day three we drove into the park early in the morning more bears and moose. Parked up the end of the public road and hiked for a few hours, weather still terrible!Visitor centre and staff excellent, restaurant at visitor centre excellent, gift shops excellent, wildlife amazing, transit bus good value - weather terrible but would go back in a heartbeat!PS also went to a couple of the free evening ranger talks (held at various locations and campsites) very good and informative on the natural and physical history of the park","September 20, 2019",Weather was terrible - but would go back in a heartbeat,56,"Warrington, United Kingdom",5
Denali,"Well worth the drive or train ride. The train ride was ver;y relaxing and allowed you to see the country side. Good accomadation and lots to do. Go see the Dog Sled Park run by Jeff King, nothing better than getting to nurse a puppy on holidays very educational.","September 19, 2019",Denali National Park Adventure Time,13,"Brisbane, Australia",5
Denali,We were so lucky. We spent three nights at the end of the road. The weather and clouds over Denali cooperated the who time. We were able to view Denali on our trip in on the Camper bus. Then our hike to Quigley ridge provided a nice view with some clouds and one morning was crystal clear with no clouds. Absolutely spectacular. Sometimes you just get lucky!,"September 18, 2019",Spectacular views,19,"Louisville, Kentucky",5
Denali,"I could write some expansive review with all kinds of adjectives but it would still not be able to describe Denali. You must go and experience it foe yourself. If not, you will have done a disservice to you entire life. Pictures and words will forever pale in comparison to being there.","September 17, 2019",If you do not visit this area at least once your life is not complete,1,,5
Denali,"August weather was rainy and misty in Denali causing LOTS of fog and mist. But perfect for bringing out the animals. The temps were pretty nice, jeans and T-shirt’s with under armory long sleeve in your back pack plus a coat with hood that’s maybe is a fleecy type. We took the Tundra tour about 8 hours long. We saw 8-10 grizzly bear , caribou, sheep, moose,..... it was amazing. I was shocked how cloudy the glacier run off rivers looked. Denali and Alaska are amazing places, but to me, it’s doesn’t hold the beauty of Rocky Mountain National Park. It just different. Enjoyed it lots.","September 17, 2019",Aug in Denali,17,"Murfreesboro, Tennessee",5
Denali,"Always wanted to see Denali - the place and the mountain although the latter is elusive. Great park, great onsite presentations. Only went in to the 20 mile point so we saw much less than is available. Maybe some time in the future as Alaska is not a one time trip. To much to see that’s so different from anything in the lower 48. Go - you should love it.","September 16, 2019",Amazing place,8,Westerville,5
Denali,"We had an amazing trip into the park. Weather could not have been better. We saw Grizzly Bears, Moose, Caribou, Sheep and Grouse. The drive was well worth it. We enjoyed lunch at Wonder Lake and that is as far as the patience of long time sitting in a car would let us go with children. I think the animals are more awake in the morning as on our drive back we didn’t seen any but the sheep on the side of the mountain. We did not ride the bus we were one of the lucky winners of the Denali Lottery .","September 15, 2019",Most amazing trip,10,"Eagle River, Alaska",5
Denali,NP Service rangers were incredibly helpful and the services provided are great. So many things to experience - Looking forward to our return.,"September 15, 2019",Worth the Trip!,7,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Denali,"Wow, what a view! We were so lucky. The day we took the 13-hour bus tour, the weather was nice. Blue sky, no clouds or haze. The mountain and the Alaskan Range apppeared in full view with no cloud/fog obstruction! I think a visit to this national park should be on everyone's bucket list!","September 14, 2019",The Mountain is Awesome!,45,Washington,5
Denali,"This is a spectacular mountain with our best views at Mt McKinley Princess Lodge. When it is clear you can see all the way to the top. Many times the top is in clouds and you have to look closely. We enjoyed the National Park; we did not get to the visitor center but if you have time the centers are usually very informative, so go!","September 14, 2019",Mt McKinley/Denali,12,,5
Denali,"This Park is as starkly beautiful and they come, the Tundra and granite mountains make for a magnificent viewing. The best and only way to travel almost all the way on the Denali Park Road is via the Tundra tour although not very photo stop friendly it is as I have intimated the only way past mile post 25(+/-). Given all that, the vistas and scenery is fantastic. Wildlife is and should not be the primary reason to visit because spotting animals is hit and miss. Even after this relatively modest review the Park is very much worth visiting and seeing.","September 14, 2019",A must see National Park,16,"Sydney, Australia",5
Denali,This is truly a must see in your life. We are part of the 30% club as only about a third of folks ever see the mountain (Denali). There is so much wildlife to see and be sure to bring your camera. We took the Tundra Wilderness Tour that was part of cruise package. Driver was an excellent guide. ,"September 11, 2019",What an awesome view,23,"Milton, Delaware",5
Denali,"Being in Denali National Forest was incredible. The vastness of the mountains, valleys, ridges, riverbeds, and animals were all breathtaking.","September 11, 2019",What a magnificent experience!,5,"Lena, Illinois",5
Denali,The beauty in and around Denali National Park is hard to describe. You need to see it yourself. We were luck to see tons of wildlife as well as Denali Mountain.,"September 10, 2019",jaw dropping,22,"Collinsville, Illinois",5
Denali,We were so fortunate to be able to experience the park and Denali on a clear day. It was a little cloudy the first hour or so then it all lifted. We saw so much wildlife & just the beauty of the park & all of its fall colors. I found the left side overlooked the park more although most of the animals appeared on our right. You can’t go wrong with any seat. They wear a headset & you can hear clearly all they say. Doug was a great guide & driver. The road is narrow and goes around a number of curves. We had taken the 8 hour RT to Eielson Center. It went by so fast. What an awesome day at Denali it was. ,"September 9, 2019",The Beauty the park Holds ,96,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5
Denali,"A really interesting visit we enjoyed here. Apparently not many people do actually camp here but we had a fantastic time with great weather and just amazing nature. It’s cool how you are absolutely free to make your Denali visit your very own. You decide the drop-off, you decide tour path... AMAZING!","September 9, 2019",Amazing Outdoor Experience!,28,"Berlin, Germany",5
Denali,"We saw lots of wildlife - caribou, dall sheep, ground squirrels but that day, no moose. The weather was nice and our driver/guide Rebecca was very knowledgeable and friendly. ONly able to drive into mile 53 due to rock slide further in the park. too cloudy to see the mountain Denali but did see it the next day in fulll sunlight - awesome sight.","September 9, 2019",Full day tour of beautiful Denali National Park,5,"Winchester, Virginia",5
Denali,"Beautiful visitors center with a great bus system. Visit the sled dogs, take a 4,8 or 12 hour ride through the park. We saw, moose, caribou, snow hates and other animals. Highly recommend visiting the park!","September 8, 2019",Trip of a lifetime!,1,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Denali,"For decades I have desired to visit Denali National Park. Finally, at 60 I did and I could not be more satisfied. We took the Park Tundra Tour and had a stellar turnout of wildlife. We saw six grizzlies, four bull moose, four cows, and a calf, 20+ mountain sheep, caribou, black fox, Golden Eagle, and a hawk. We had a remarkable sight seeing trip into the Denali, what our guide/naturalist calls the Denali Grand Slam - the four largest mammals in the park. The scenic views and vistas are indescribable. Yes, as anyone who has been here knows, the buses are uncomfortable but the narrowness of the unpaved roads will not accommodate coaches. The momentary discomfort was of little account when you compare it to what you get to see. The guide is your driver and we received an education from “Professor” Justin. ","September 7, 2019",Put It on Your Bucket List,4,"Richmond, Rhode Island",5
Denali,Truly a one in a lifetime experience. Do your hiking in the first 15 miles of the park road. I would not take the long bus tour unless the weather is not good for being out for hikimg. Hiked the Savage Alpine Trail and Horseshoe Lake Trail. Enjoyed the views and serenity. ,"September 5, 2019",The Great One,0,,5
Denali,Stunning and very informative. A whole new world. This truly is a must see. We stayed at the bluffs and it was a gorgeous view. My dad is handicap and this place can be tough for someone that has mobility issues. They do their best with golf carts but there are no elevators and it was a tough go getting him up there stairs. ,"September 5, 2019",Nothing like it. ,0,"Newcastle, Wyoming",5
Denali,"The park transit bus and the narrated tour bus travel the same route, but pricing is a huge difference. We took the park transit bus and totally enjoyed our 11-hour tour to Wonder Lake. For every visitors to Denali National Park (DNP), sighting of the BIG 5 (grizzly bear, caribou, moose, doll sheep and wolf) is a treat. That said, the sight of a wolf is hard to come by, similar to hitting the lottery! We were able to see the remaining 4 which is not too shabby for a 11-hour bus ride into the PARK. The picturesque views of park is breathtaking; it is almost like looking at a gigantic wallpaper. All visitors must bring their food/drinks as nothing is sold inside the park. And DO NOT LITTER in the park. Totally enjoyed Denali National Park!","September 4, 2019",Take the transit bus,4,,5
Denali,Interesting park. Point of a visit here is to see some wildlife up close while looking for Denali 70 miles away. The dog sled kennels were the absolute best part of the adventure. Local town has a couple good dining options but is otherwise quirky a hell.,"September 4, 2019",An unusal approach to a landmark,11,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5
Denali,"This is a must see destination for any National Park enthusiast. The landscape is gorgeous, the views are incredible and the abundance and diversity of wildlife you'll see is difficult to match. Allow for several days, if possible, as the weather and cloud cover can impact your experience. Consider staying at one of the campgrounds in the park if you can in order to save time covering transportation ground each day.","September 4, 2019",This park is spectacular,6,"Brooklyn, New York",5
Denali,"One of the prettiest National Parks I have been in with so much wildlife. I was part of the 70% who only see the base or the top of Denali itself, but it is still impressive. ","September 4, 2019",WOW!!,71,"Natrona Heights, Pennsylvania",5
Denali,"A great national park. Bears, moose, caribou, and more. Forests and tundra. 15% chance of seeing Mt. Denali, so don’t get fixated on this. One road, no cars, so you take bus tours. Still worth it. If you are a backpacker, this is a great place to visit.","September 3, 2019",Absolute bucket list destination,27,"New York City, New York",5
Denali,We took the tour bus to milepost 66. The trip was a bit rough but the views were worth it. Bring a lunch. No food available on the route. ,"September 3, 2019",Alaska trip,47,Baton Rouge,5

Tour was well organized, great lunch at their Lodge, plenty of snacks, bathroom breaks! Highly recommend!","September 3, 2019",Amazing!,0,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana",5
Denali,"We had a full day tour (reviewed separately) and saw a huge amount of wildlife, and great views throughout. We also drove the first section of the park road which is open to cars, and did the loop walk - busy but enjoyable. I thoroughly recommend visiting this park. There are free shuttles which go most of the way into the park, and hikers can be dropped off and are encouraged to walk off the trails. ","September 3, 2019",Gorgeous views and lots of wildlife opportunities,46,"London, United Kingdom",5
Denali,"This is a beautiful and immense national park. Though Denali's summit was not visible while we were physically in the park, we saw it in Talkeetna and it was impressive.We got to see caribou, bears, moose, and dall sheep, as well as some snowshoe hares and birds. Eielson Visitor Center was informative and a good rest stop We made it to Kantishna, which is the ""end of the line"" for the road in Denali. We saw Fannie Quigley's home there and posed for a picture at the road's end. If you have the stamina, go all the way down the road! Be aware that food is not available in most of the park!","September 3, 2019",Awesome park!,190,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Denali,"I took the Tundra Wilderness Bus tour which lasts about 9 hours and loved drinking in the scenery and wildlife. The bus driver's narration is interesting and super informative and he also helps the group get the best views of wildlife. We saw dozens of grizzly bears, caribou and moose. We also saw the babies of each of these animals, so it was so amazing to witness them in the wild. Great experience! Binoculars were helpful at times.","September 3, 2019",Unforgettable Scenery and Wildlife!,8,"Koganei, Japan",5

It was a great experience for family with kid.","September 2, 2019",Animals and scenery,0,,5
Denali,"We took the 8 hour green transit bus tour through Denali. We were there at the end of August 2019. Great time to be there. No large crowds. Our bus driver, Tobi, was great. She gave excellent narrations of the history of Denali, interesting facts, and was extremely knowledgeable about the wildlife in the park. We saw caribou, moose, a red fox, and 2 grizzly's. We were part of the 30% club even though the first half of our journey was rainy. When we approached wildlife, Tobi stayed awhile so everyone on the bus could see it and take pictures. There are breaks along the way approximately every 90 minutes. Dress appropriately, bring your camera and binoculars. Don't forget snacks and water.","September 2, 2019",A day in Denali,36,Pearland,5
Denali,"Including the experts with us, we had 20 people and we were in one Park Bus for a full day tour. Timing for seeing the animals is what is key...you might see a lot or you might see none. We were blessed with multiple sightings of Caribu, Moose, and Bear. The only sheep we could see were way up in mountains as white dots. Our driver was incredible and a lot of fun. This trip is well worth every penny. ","September 1, 2019",Smithsonian Journey’s group ,98,"Georgetown, Texas",5
Denali,"We were so fortunate to see moose, goats, bear, and loads of birds. It is definitely worth the time to travel throughout the park. You never know what you are going to see. It was toward the end of the season and the park was not crowded.","September 1, 2019",Fantastic visit and loads of wildlife,26,"Cocoa, Florida",5
Denali,"We only had 1 day in Denali, and it was misty/overcast (as is typical, I hear). We had been on too many plane/bus rides already, so we didn't opt for a bus tour in Denali park, but people that did said they saw a lot of wildlife. We opted instead for a moderate hike starting from the visitor's center. We walked for over 2 miles, on a Saturday, and only passed 3 other people, which I though was amazing for how crowded the visitor's center was. I didn't realize that ""the"" Denali mountain was 80 or so miles from the visitor's center. It was a nice hike, trails were groomed nicely, and there were no bears. I wish I had more than 1 day here.The next day, we took a bus from Denali to Seward, and had a GREAT view of the mountain and got some pictures.","August 30, 2019",I wish I had more time to spend here,9,"Cary, United States",4

Denali,"Our group took the 8 hour Denali ranger led bus to the interior of the park.The buses are pretty basic with no toilette and a pretty rough ride over poor roads. They make stops every 90 minutes at enhanced outdoor toilettes. We saw, off in the distance, bears, caribou, and female moose with one youngster along with smaller animals. The weather was spectacular and we were able to the entire Denali mountain. There are amazing vistas in every direction.","August 27, 2019",Awesome experience!!,19,"Williamsburg, Virginia",5

Denali,"We stayed at the Denali Princess Lodge which sits only about a mile outside the national park, and we were even able to walk to a nearby trailhead that led into the park and to the Visitor Center. There are also shuttles that ran frequently, so reaching various areas and trails inside Denali was pretty effortless. We hiked three different trails, and all were enjoyable.due to u seasonably warm weather, it did not quite seem like Alaska. We aw #now on Denali/Mt. McKinley, but never encountered any on the trails. Everything was very green, with lots of flowers, and the trails were well-groomed. Although we saw evidence of wildlife ( a few tracks, moose scat, beaver dams, beaver-downed trees, etc.) and heard that other hikers had seen a moose, we never saw any wildlife except water fowl, ground squirrels and a snowshoe hare. Even so, the views from and along the trails, and variety of ferns and wildflowers and the relative absence of very many other people along the trails (i.e.- peace and quiet) made our visit very enjoyable. It would have been nice to have had a few more days here.","August 26, 2019",Enjoyable,181,"Norman, OK",5
Denali,"We had the chance to see the beautiful mountain and were absolutely wowwed! We kept seeing clouds and rain wondering, ""will we know it when we see it?"" Yes. Of course you will recognize it - Denali is simply amazing! The Great One!In the park we took the narrated bus tour, the Tundra Wilderness Tour, with guide Brian. He did an amazing job stopping for animals we saw. He was amazingly patient with the very rude people on the bus with us who just kept yelling at each other and making the day generally uncomfortable for the rest of us. We saw MANY bears, a number of caribou, dall sheep, bald eagles, many other birds, but no moose. The trip was just great and I would certainly do it again.One of our teens loved it and the other hated it.The bus stops about every 2 hours for bathroom breaks. They give you a box full of snacks on the trip, but we packed lunches - otherwise it is a long day.We found out the day before that our bus left at 9am so that was nicer than the crazy early times that were possible.","August 26, 2019",WOW!,319,"Gainesville, Georgia",5

Denali,"I had a very bad experience with Alaska Mountaineering School climbing Denali in the summer of 2019 and would strongly recommend you to not go with them if you want to summit Denali. Our lead guide, Con Severis, was constantly yelling, swearing at the entire group, leading while listening to loud music that made it impossible to communicate with him and not providing any instruction/help in critical moments to his rope team.His behavior was not only highly unprofessional, but he also put us in several dangerous situations. He would become angry if we had a bad weather day and storm down steep hills and even asked another person in our group to untie from the fixed line and go down an icy slope holding only on his ice axe. We felt unsafe numerous times, scared to voice our concerns and felt treated very poorly.We continued the trip nevertheless because we all wanted to summit. We were a group of 7, one of us had to go back because of frostbite, the remaining 6 of us got very close to last camp before summit at 16,000 feet. That's when Con told us that he won't take all of us to summit because there weren't enough guides. He had decided from day one according to him that only 3 people from our group will summit and now because 6 of us had made it he was going to turn back 3 of us to base camp even if we were feeling great, had no issues and the weather was good. Things went downhill from there and the group lost confidence in the guides' abilities and willingness to lead us to the summit - all of us except one chose to go down and not summit with Con as our guide because we thought it was very risky. It was honestly one of the hardest decisions I had to make in my life being so close to the summit we have been training for.The responses from the manager and AMS to our complaints have been disappointing - they decided to place the blame on all of us and didn't even apologize. We are now considering to sue them.Please feel free to reach out to me, I am happy to share more of my experience. From my experience, the guide company you choose is an important decision given how hard the mountain is and the high price investment. I am very sorry I chose AMS and I will regret this forever but I hope other climbers are aware.","August 24, 2019",Terrible experience with Alaska Mountaineering School climbing Denali,1,,1
Denali,"Denali National Park is home to the highest peaks in North America, formerly known at Mount McKinley. Denali is native American for ""The High One.""I toured 52 miles of the 92-mile Park Road with one of the Doyon Tours which all depart from the Wilderness Access Center near the Park Entrance.The Denali North and South Peaks (roughly 20,000 feet) are relatively distant from the Park Road, some 75 miles, and views can be quite elusive to see in the summer months. We caught a glimpse from the Park Road at Sanctuary River (mile 20). It is difficult to appreciate fully the height and grandeur of the peaks from such a distance.The National Park and its wilderness areas are massive, and the wildlife plentiful. In addition to mountains and glaciers, there are the rivers, meadows, and multi-color (called polychrome) hills. There is also an sled dog kennel with friendly Alaskan Huskies to visit.The Park is massive, the views can be stunning, and the touring is well organized, but I was a little disappointed by the limited access to the Denali peaks. You must take an air taxi to the base of the peaks. I have been to over one dozen iconic National Parks this year, and some are more grandiose than others. Denali should be on your bucket list to visit on any trip to Alaska, but there are perhaps even more spectacular Parks in the National Park system.","August 24, 2019",A Massive National Park and Wilderness Area in the Alaska Range,44,"Goleta, California",4

We took the bus trip and saw bears, caribou, a moose, and some small critters. Most of the wildlife is at a great distance which is great for them. The majority of the bus ride is learning about the area and seeing the glacial areas.

We were on the bus for about 9 hours and saw many grizzly bears, moose, caribou and more! It's great that only buses are allowed past mile 15. It preserves the park, protects the animals and provides crowd control. (We were recently in the Great Smoky Mountains and the traffic was horrific which greatly reduced our enjoyment of that park.)

Denali,"Alaska Mountaineering School (AMS) was a terrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone!! I am a management consultant and a serious mountaineer (doing 4 mountains/ year with multiple international/ local companies) and have never had a worst experience. We were 6 participants on an expedition to summit Denali on 23-May 2019 and 5 of us had to return one day before the summit because we did not trust our Lead Guide (Con Severis and Second Guide (Chris Welch) to take us to the top due to safety problems as well as horrible/ inhuman client service. All the trip participants are experienced mountaineers and have hired many international and local guide companies. We are all well-versed with safety, service and professionalism standards. The Denali trip did not meet these standards. Below are some high level examples of what we experienced:>>Egregious Safety Concerns. There were numerous safety issues that put the participants at risk throughout the expedition. Just a couple of the examples include:While guiding a roped team under strong wind conditions, the lead guide listened to loud music on his headphones, making him unable to hear his own roped team under strong wind conditionsWhile ordering an unnecessary and risky pass of another team, the lead guide demanded a client unhook from the fixed line and slide down a steep icy slope with only an ice axe.>>Denial of Summit For No Reason. We were denied the summit for no reason -- when the weather was good, there were no health or capability concerns, and the guide ratio exceeded Denali’s standard guide ratio of 1:3.>>Unacceptable Client Treatment. The treatment of the participants was unprofessional and offensive throughout the expedition. The guides frequently screamed at the participants for no reason. The guides insulted us, calling us ""spoiled brats"".After this happened, the owner of AMS, Colby Coombs completely ignored our concerns, did not reply for two months to emails sent from everyone in the team and then sent the same email to each one of us saying that he trusts his guide, with no further explanation.

The next morning we got up early to go on a bus trip to the park, to see the wildlife and to see if we can see Denali from the park. To our good fortune, for the second day in a row, we were able to see the great sight for a second time.

I would also find when Ben (pictured below) is driving as he used to be a tour guide so will happily give stories on the park and how he met his girlfriend!!

They do have free shuttles.  The day we scheduled our transit bus tour to Kantishna I was worried that by the time the bus picked us up at Savage Creek we wouldnt get 4 seats together so we drove down and got on the bus down at the depot. But that's just me making sure things go smoothly for my little family. We went all the way to Kantishna which was a 12 hour day! Crazy huh? It was smoky the day we went so really didnt want to do any hiking. We saw tons of wildlife and our bus driver was awesome. I brought lunch and snacks but not enough!!! We got hungry towards the end.

There are various shuttle buses which take you into the park, so check out their web site for schedules. If you are driving you can only go as far a Savage River as no cars are permitted beyond that point. If you want to drive that stretch of road, make sure that you arrive as soon as the park is open as there is limited car parking. We arrived around 10.30am and the parking area was full so we had to turn around. On our way back we stopped and hiked the Mountain Vista Trailhead, an easy 1km loop trail. There are signs along the trail where you can compare the scenery back in the day to what you are seeing in the moment that you are there. The parking area is large and there are picnic tables and toilets. After returning to the visitor centre we then walked the Horseshoe Lake Trail a 4.8km walk if you leave from the visitor centre it takes around 2 1/2hrs.There is also a small parking area at Mile 1 where the Alaska Railroad crosses the road, the beginning of the trial head. Once at lake level, the trail branches off in two directions. One takes you around the lake and past a beaver dam, and the other to the Nenana River. We did both trails and it was just such a beautiful and relaxing walk.

You have to ride a bus into the park (cars are prohibited), and it's a long, rough road. The visitors area is very well organized. The Park Rangers are friendlier than those I've encountered in other national parks. But that bus ride will shake the fillings out of your teeth.

Denali,"We spent four days in the park. First we did a bus tour to Eielson. A wonderful bus trip. I'd highly suggest the Apline Trail across from the visitor center - it's a tough climb but worth it as you will be up there were with less than 25 people (especially if the mountain is out). We spent about 3 hours hiking and having lunch up there. Very easy to go to bus dispatch and get back after hiking. We took another bus to Wonder lake - nice views - but no very little wildlife b/w Eielson and Wonder lake. I would suggest two bus trips - mostly because the wildlife is different each time you go out. Also, we signed up for a discovery hike - which was great. Ours wasn't fully booked - but the ranger said that was rare that they were not fully booked. (FYI, you can book it at the front visitor center OR at Eielson).

We were fortunate and got a 7% day where we could see the mountain and all the rest of the range, but the hikling is more than you can do in a lifetime.

I don't think it gets much better than this and we feel very fortunate.

We did not take the bus tour, we took the bus to Eielson Visitor Center. IT was much cheaper, PLUS your driver will stop for wildlife, share stories and facts throughout the entire trip. At the Eielson Visitor Center, we hiked 3 of the trails. The Alpine Trail or Thorofare Ridge Trail, same trail, at the moment changing the name. This is a VERY difficult and steep hike but it is worth it. Took us about an hour to get up. (1,000 feet in 1 mile) BUT we saw Mt Danali!! Only 30% of people see this fabulous site. Getting to the top of this hike gives you a great opportunity to see Mt. Denali. We also hiked Gorge Creek Trail . Trail not as difficult but a bit challenging.

Denali,"Denali National Park is one of those mythical places you always hear about and can't wait to visit when you're finally in Alaska. So when my girlfriend and I decided to do a two-week camping roadtrip around the state, DNP was obviously picked as a spot to visit. When we got there it was a beautiful day and we were able to fairly easily drive into the park and down the main road. I guess you can drive about 15 miles before you have to stop and you can't go any further without being on a tour bus. That was OK with us because there's actually a few beautiful trails there that you can do, and the views are incredible. The only thing that sucks is that you can't bring your dog on any of these trails. That being said we did see some people with their dogs on leashes and decided to risk it anyway - our Pomeranian is pretty small, and wasn't going to cause that much trouble. But be advised that dogs aren't generally welcome in the Park itself and you may get comments and dirty looks from people.","July 20, 2019",Breathtaking views - just don't bring a dog?,63,"Whitehorse, Canada",5

Go, and prepare to be wowed by your experience.","July 20, 2019",Too much for words,57,"Boones Mill, Virginia",5
Denali,"Denali National Park and Preserve is a beautiful place with lands untouched by man. It is important to note that Denali is more of a preserve than a ""park."" Cars are not allowed beyond the bus station. You must buy a bus ticket to go very deep into the park. There are no real ""trails"" past the bus depot either. My husband and I hiked the tundra by compass just to make sure we didn't get turned around in all the wide open land. If you buy a bus ticket, you can get off the bus at any stop and catch another bus later. The only problem with this is, the buses are really full, and it's very hard to find a bus that has room for you to hitch a ride back. I feel like Denali needs to get a better system for making sure hikers don't get stranded. Some hikers were waiting and told by 5-6 buses that there was no room. When my husband and I were trying to catch a bus back after a hike, we were over 50 miles from our car, so walking back wasn't an option. When we finally caught a bus, it was almost completely full and we had to sit away from one another. The bus driver would stop if someone spotted wildlife, but you had to remain on the bus and it was so crowded that getting a good view of anything was difficult. The bus system is really set up like more of a sight-seeing adventure. It's very crowded and touristy. If you enjoy that type of thing and want to sit on a crowded bus for 4+ hours, you would probably enjoy this. I prefer exploring alone.I should also add, there is no where to buy food or drinks past the bus station, so make sure you bring all you will need for a full days' adventure!","July 19, 2019",A Touristy Experience,82,,4

Denali,"We really enjoyed our 48 hours at Denali. We arrived on the train from Fairbanks around noon, and we left two days later on the train bound for Anchorage at 12:30 PM. We spent our first afternoon hiking both the McKinley Station Trail and the Horseshoe Lake Trail. We spent our second day doing an 8-hour Tundra Wilderness Tour on a bus that departed at 8 AM, followed by hiking the Savage River Loop Trail in the afternoon. And we spent the morning of our third day hiking the Roadside Trail up to the sled dog demonstration, and then taking the free shuttle back to the visitor center. We also spent time at the visitor center on each day when we had some time here or there. Most of these items have their own separate TripAdvisor entries, but I’ll talk about two things that do not:First, the McKinley Station Trail is a nice easy trail. It leads away from the visitor center down to the Riley Creek Campground. The only problem is that it is not a loop trail, and so you are left with a choice of getting back to the visitor center by walking along the road or taking the free shuttle, or hiking the same trail back up to the visitor center. We elected to take the shuttle back up, mainly because the trail is essentially downhill from the visitor center and would have been an uphill hike back to the visitor center if we had taken the McKinley Station Trail again. Nevertheless, we enjoyed this trail, as it made its way along the river and offered some beautiful views.Second, the Roadside Trail that leads from the visitor center to the dogsled demonstration is a very nice trail. I would rate it moderate because of the amount of elevation change, mostly uphill on the way from the visitor center to the dogsled demonstration. It took us about an hour to hike. The name is misleading, because although it follows the road, it is not directly next to the road, and so there is plenty of scenery to view along the way. It is a little bit easier and shorter of a hike than the Rock Creek Trail, which also leads from the visitor center to the dogsled demonstration.And one final point: I thought the signage at the visitors center about where the trails were located was not that great. There is a sign at the visitor center that points towards ""trails,"" but that is only the McKinley Station Trail, the Taiga trail, the Roadside trail, and the Rock Creek Trail (i.e., not the Horseshoe Lake Trail). Our plan when we first arrived was to hike the Horseshoe Lake Trail, and so we followed the signage for ""trails."" We soon learned that the Horseshoe Lake trailhead was in the opposite direction. As a result, we just continued on by doing the McKinley Station Trail.","July 16, 2019",A must-do on your visit to Alaska,244,"Tampa, Florida",5

Denali,"Denali National Park ranks up there with Yosemite in terms of the fascinating geology, wildlife and beauty. It's size is enormous and the variety of wildlife would probably remind one of Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon. I liked that there were rules in place to control the number of visitors and vehicles allowed into the heart of the park after reaching the gate at the Savage River. All our best national parks are being stressed by the number of visitors and vehicles, but Denali is especially vulnerable because it lies within the region where North American permafrost exists. Permafrost is already being stressed by the rise in global temperature. (Fairbanks reached 90° for the first time ever not long before I wrote this review.)

Denali,"Denali National Park is one of those special places. Of course, the main attraction is Denali, the mountain—at over 22,000 feet high, the tallest mountain in North America. But you can't count on always seeing it; it's so massive that it creates its own weather and is often covered in clouds. We didn't see it this trip but had had a good view of it on a previous trip, and it is really marvelous.The Tundra Wilderness Tour is a tour run by a concessionaire via the National Park. It is the only way to drive into the park past the Mile 25 marker. Polychrome Pass is beautiful, and is much of the other. We saw mountains, tundra, and Boreal forest—which includes black spruce, the strangest-looking trees I have seen. One of the highlights are viewing the wild animals; we saw caribou, Dahl sheep, grizzlies, and birds. Great experience. Just don't expect to sight any particular animal on any given day—they are wild, and the park service has no control over when they appear.The park and its surrounding area have many great attractions.

We got tickets for the 6am tour, which is early but we wanted to make sure we would have parking. I'm not sure that you have to book such an early tour, but if you're driving, I do recommend going earlier rather than later since parking was full when we came back.The bus ride was a bit bumpy, and I heard that the front is less bumpy than the back of the bus. On the ride to Eielson, sit on the left as that's the side most of the valleys and land will be, so you'll have a better chance of spotting wildlife.We saw a giant porcupine, several bears (including mamas and cubs), several caribou, golden eagles, a falcon, some dall sheep, and lots of hares and ground squirrels. Most of the bears we saw were in the last stretch near Eielson, so if you want to see some bears, be sure to book the bus that goes that far out. The caribou were around Tolkat in the gravel and water.The bus stops about every 90 minutes for a rest break so you have the opportunity to use the bathroom (really clean, no sink just hand sanitizer). The bus drivers are also really good about stopping to let people take pictures of wildlife. On our bus, we yelled ""STOP"" whenever we saw something, our driver would stop, and everyone would take pictures. Then, we'd continue until the next rest stop or until someone saw another animal.You can also get off of the green buses whenever you want. We chose to stick with the same bus from start to finish, so we left at 6am and got back to the bus depot around 2pm.

Denali,"Great park, great beauty, wonderful wildlife! Riding the buses controls the crowds, I think, lessens the damage, and keeps the environment safer for the animals that live there. Read before you go so you understand the way things are done. That way, when you get there, you do not waste your time trying to understand it all. There are several bus tour options and you can reserve online early. There are hikes, camping, and outdoor activities. There is a free dog kennel demo 3 times a day in the summer @ 10, 2 and 4. You catch a free shuttle bus from the Visitor Center to the kennel to see the dogs that work in the park. The Visitor Center and Bus Depot are very nice facilities. Great park! I would totally recommend a visit to this national park! Just wished I lived closer so I could easily return. ","June 24, 2019",Nothing less than a 5!,205,Tennessee,5

Denali,"Denali national park does it right. They balance the needs of us humans to see the wild animals but NOT at the expense of harming the environment or animals. Their rules keep the selfish and stupid humans who can’t follow a simple rule under control. If you’ve been to Yosemite or Yellowstone lately, you know what I’m talking about. You must see this unless you are a person who doesn’t respect the environment, animals or other humans.","June 22, 2019",A must do experience,8,,5

Denali,"Make sure you go to Denali with proper expectations set. This is a huge park and the wildlife has a massive amount of room to roam. I think our bus narrator said there is a 30% +/- chance of seeing bear in Denali. We were fortunate and saw 3 Grizzly Bears on our tour. Please NOTE you will be super lucky to see bear at all and they are probably going to be a speck off in the distance that you will need excellent binoculars (bring your own) for. The tour buses (we were on Tundra Wilderness Tour) also have cameras that are pretty good quality and the bus driver will zoom in on wildlife so you can see it on the screens on the bus. Our driver, Matt, did a great job of providing us with a plethora of information about the park. Thanks Matt! They provide a snack box that has a bunch of snack size items in it. Water provided in aluminum cans on bus. We packed sandwiches and drinks with us. Note, there is note a designated time to stop for lunch...big park, picnic and watch for wildlife. Bathroom stops approximately every hour and these are very nice outdoor bathrooms that are well cared for (at least the ones I used). You will want to book a flying tour of Denali as well in order to take in the full Denali experience and I highly recommend Fly Denali so you can land on the glacier (see my other review on this).","June 21, 2019","Go in with your expectations set - it is wildlife people, they decide when they want to be seen, you don't.",1,,4

We took hotel night before the train, a stop in Denali before bus trip, and arrived if not rested,, not exhausted.

While these miles have a beautiful landscape - they do not compare to what you will see if you get tickets on a transit shuttle or tour bus (available only for sale at the bus depot or online). We were lucky to see both Denali and lots of animals (brown bears, moose, caribou, Dall Sheep) on our trip. This park was created specifically to preserve wildlife and only later enlarged to include Denali (park roads do not always provide views of the mountain-even if it is visible). Also there are only a handful of maintained hiking trails.

We had a lengthy opportunity to see a grizzly bear with a cub quite close to the bus. The time flies by as you look for wildlife. If you go to Denali the Wilderness Tour is an absolute must, it would be a terrible shame to miss it. Our driver Sarah was terrific at spotting the animals and operating the camera that enables you to see the animals close up. Apparently many of the drivers are very good. There is a push to preserve the park by hauling all trash out and recycling, which helps ensure that future generations can enjoy what we are able to see.

We saw the peak, so we are now in the 5% group that got to see the peak on their first day. This statement was per our tour guide. However we did not get to travel to the spot where most photos of the peak are taken. That part of the road will not open until June 2. I went a few days too early. We had a full bus and the seats are not made for mature Americans, especially for an 8 hour ride. You'll be up close and friendly with other riders. A small snack box will be furnished. Free, canned water is available on the bus. Your furnished box of snacks and if you purchased an additional box lunch, which I recommend, this will be eaten while riding in your crowded seat. The bus does stop periodically for bathroom breaks this works for some and others have to figure a way to make it work. The driver has a remote camera and a spotting scope, the picture is shown on a drop down screen so all can see. There was not enough room for my camera equipment and I think this played a role in me not enjoying the tour as much as I had hoped. It seems most of the wildlife was always spotted on the side opposite of me. I don't know if there is a best side to be on the bus, it's a luck thing when it comes to seeing the wildlife. But you still get to see them through the drop down screen. Our driver was very knowledgeable, this was his 15th year. As stated earlier, our bus had plenty of free canned water. Your container of water could be left behind so that'll be one less item that you have to keep up with in the crowded environment.

Denali,"We love visiting National Parks and Denali was no exception!!It is so beautiful and there are so many animals to see.The main visitor center is at mile marker 1 on a 92 mile road that runs through the heart of the park. The visitor center is open 8 am to 6 pm. The first 14 miles of the road are paved and accessible to everyone. That section of the road is perfect for moose and we saw a number of them. Between mile marker 10 and 12 you can see Denali if the clouds aren’t covering it. At the end of the road there is a parking lot and a 2 mile loop hike along the river. We started to do the hike but saw a mama grizzly and 2 cubs in the distance. They were awesome to see but we changed our mind about doing the hike at that time.The rest of the road is only accessible by park service shuttles or various tours. I would definitely recommend a tour. It is an all day tour but with the guide you see so many animals. We would have never picked them out if we had driven it ourselves.We saw caribou, Dall sheep, female moose with little ones, grizzlies with cubs, bull moose, a fox and lots of different types of birds. Definitely bring binoculars and a camera with a nice zoom lens.

Others saw Caribou and Moose. You could see animal tracks everywhere in the mud.

Get this, they charge you $15 per person to enter the park BUT WAIT IT GETS BETTER. you can’t see a fraction of the park for your $$$. Instead they want another $65 a person to take you 66 miles into the park, yep you can do a few trails close to the visitor center but if you want to see the park they are going to pilfer you for more money. You are hearing this from a seasoned traveler with 100’s or thousands of miles under his belt. I can’t even put DENALI IN MY TOP 20. We hiked the few trails that they would let us on and did about 30 miles, we saw plenty of moose, Dall sheep, as well as local wildlife but I have seen more along the road driving through the Rockies or Banff and Jasper. We were incredibly disappointed with the way this place was run. The forest rangers hired to help you just started 2 weeks ago. My wife and I knew more than they did.

Private tour busses and park busses are about the only access allowed beyond the first 15 miles of park road. The park busses allow you to get off the buss anywhere along the route for some “non-trail” day hiking but permits are required for any wilderness camping and are limited by park section to assure a great experience.

Be sure to travel at least to the Eielson Visitor Center for views of Denali and a better chance at seeing wildlife. Going beyond Eielson improves your chances for wildlife significantly.

Denali,"An amazing National Park that is worthy of all that it has to offer. Kudos to those who have maintained the integrity of the park by not commercializing it. We took the bus tour 60+ miles along the steep, curvy and narrow roadways, while seeking the various animals in the park. We were fortunate to see a female moose less than 5-minutes into our ride. We also happened upon 14 grizzly bears throughout the trip, with our last encounter less than 50-yards from the bus for a grizzly that was laying down and facing us with his paws rested under his chin. We also saw 30+ Dall sheep and 2 more female moose, and plenty of suicidal ground squirrels. My only regret is that the bus we had was older and the windows took some effort to put down or up to allow for photos. This trip isn't for the faint of heart, as the roads are steep, narrow and you may feel as if the bus is going over the side, but rest assured and trust your driver to get you there and back safely. The highlight was seeing the top of Denali from various vantage points throughout our excursion. Simply amazing.","October 8, 2018",30% club member 3 days in a row,199,New Jersey,5

Due to the height of the mountain (over 20,000 feet high) it creates it's own weather system and a lot of the time is covered by clouds but the day we were there we had clear blue skies.

It is certainly worth the trip to see such gorgeous landscape. If you have time check out the wonderful gift shops just down the road. There are amazing local finds to be had.

Denali is the third largest Park in the US after two other parks in Alaska! It very hard to see Denali the highest peak in Alaska as its more to the south of the park.

Denali,I've reviewed the Tundra Tour separately but as a national park this place is definitely worth seeing. With its dirt roads and high mountain peaks and some wildlife it's worth touring. We also enjoyed the Visitor Center (though they closed early at 5 pm) and the husky dog team demonstration. You catch a bus from near the Visitor Ctr for this tour which is held a few times a day.

This place is amazing but if you want to see the park you need to plan a bus tour into the park as you are not allowed to drive very far on your own.

It's especially nice to visit in mid September due to the vivid colored flora. I enter the Road Lottery each year. Although I never win- lol, I still make the trip up here from the lower 48 to visit this park. If you don't win a road pass you can still drive to mile post 15 and hike one of the several hiking trails they have in the park. They have around eight or ten different trails to hike. You can also camp in one of the designated camping areas or apply for a back-country permit at the Visitor Center. Although my wife and I did not see any wildlife this time around, the views definitely make up for it.

The land in September was dressed in it's finest fall colors with the deciduous trees aglow in gold against the green of the black and white spruce. The mountains were awesome and the rivers, lakes and streams sparkled in the sunshine. Alaskan brown bear, moose, and caribou browsed in fields, tundra and forest, while Dall sheep climbed as high as they could to make it difficult to find them...but with sharp eyes and binoculars...we did! Sandhill cranes by the hundreds were staging for their flights South and sometimes we caught sight of a bald eagle or hawk. The terrain of the Park is so interesting and varied, as is the wildlife.

Denali,"We did a 2 week RV trip in June, 2018 - we flew into Anchorage, picked up the rental RV, and camped several places in Alaska. We spent 3 days in Denali. It was majestic and beautiful, weather was very nice in June. I was not aware that there was one road in and one road out of Denali, and your only way about is on one of two bus lines, up a very very narrow one lone road. I did not like that at all, but did love the animals. Went as are as Wonder Lake - should have stayed on the bus to Kantishna but was not aware that it was only another 10 miles or so. Mosquitos were awful at Wonder Lake. It was a once in a lifetime trip, but honestly - I would do Yellowstone again before ever going back to Denali. I LOVED the rest of Alaska - Denali was just not as impressive as I wished since I went specifically for animals.","September 17, 2018",Worth the Trip,27,"Keller, TX",4
Denali,"We visited in early September, after the rush of the summer. Early September is one of the best times to visit, as the tundra turns yellows and orange, there are virtually no mosquitoes and the weather is more often clear. The only way to get into the park (past the 12-mile point) is by park bus. There are several buses - two of them are narrated. There's the Tundra Wilderness Tour, which is about 8 hours and goes about 60 miles into the park. It's the best if you want to see wildlife. There's also a History tour, which is about 5 hours - it goes about 30 miles into the park. We did both, and both are different. It's a good idea to spend at least 3 days at Denali, as your chances of seeing the mountain is about 25% on any given day (on average), and there's a lot to do in the area besides the NP (Talkeetna, Husky Homestead, etc.).If you go in September, be sure it's early in the month, as many restaurants and hotels close around mid-month.","September 17, 2018",One of the best pristine National Parks,192,"West Hartford, Connecticut",5

It is just over a 3 mile round-trip over a well marked trail. There is a 250 ft elevation (stairs) but I was able to make it and I had knee replacement surgery just 4 months prior.During the hike we saw: female moose and her young; beaver dam; snowshoe rabbits; arctic ground squirrel; a female moose feeding in the lake and a lynx.

We lucked out in having a driver who was very willing not only to stop to spot wildlife but to pass around her binoculars. Thought 8 hours on a bus sounded like possibly too much but that includes lots of stops and when you’re seeing all those animals, the time passes quickly!

Denali,"Huge National Park with North America's largest mountain - Denali. Getting around the park is in school buses fitted out a little better than standard school bus seats, but designed to handle the rough conditions of dirt roads etc. The national park runs a bunch of different day trips into the park, of different time lengths. We chose the 8 hr trip - one way in and one way out of the park, so you see it from both sides of the bus at different times of the day. We did the 2 pm trip and arrived back late at night, but because the sun sets so late in Alaska, only the last hr was dark/dusk. Scenery on the trip is stunning. Mountains and rivers, tundra and wild life everywhere. You have to be pretty clever to see them sometimes - at a distance, or camouflaged in amongst the bushes and grass etc. Our guide/driver was fantastic at spotting animals and would stop the bus so we could view them. He even connected his camera with a super zoom lense to the bus tv system so we could seem them on screen.

Denali,Two things to know before going to Denali. It is unusual to get a close up view of the animals or a clear view of Denali. Only 30% of people who go ever see Denali (Mt McKinley). It is worth the effort when you do. It is breathtaking. Take binoculars to see the animals up close. With 6.2 million acres the animals can get lost in it. Also be aware that there is only one road into and out of Denali. It is 92 miles long and you can only drive your car the first 15 miles. You have to take a bus for a trip into the park. We took a green transit bus for $40 per person and it was fantastic. Our driver was knowledgeable and talkative as well as friendly. You make stops for restrooms every 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Denali,"Denali protects the wildlife and manages the people- my kind of national park! This park is absolutely spectacular-the mountains, rivers, animals-it is amazing. The park rangers are really knowledgeable and so committed to preserving the wilderness. We took the bus to mile 63...wish we went even further. There really is no place like this in the lower 48! Our bus driver was funny, inspirational and knew so much about the history of the park. You must do this if you go-otherwise you will never really see the park. Unfortunately, we never saw the mountain-shrouded in fog and snow. But that was ok...we knew it was there. This park is what was intended when Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir and others understood when they advocated to protecting the environment and wildlife.","September 5, 2018",My favorite national park!,1,"West Hartford, Connecticut",5

Denali,"Denali National Park is amazing beyond words. Getting here is a challenge alone, much less making it near the mountain(s). The guided bus tours are good, but not cheap ($200/person for full day). You will see LOTS of animals (grizzlies, reindeer, wolf, moose, coyote, etc), but they may not be close, or on your side of the bus. Even in the middle of summer, expect cold/wet weather (nights in 40s/days in 50s), and be prepared (hat, wet weather gear, fleece, wool socks, waterproof boots).

We saw 13 bears and a lot other animals except wolf. In addition, we saw Denali peak which only 1/3 visitors have a chance to see. The best view to see it is from Eielson Visitor Center. If I visit the park again, I would only take transit bus to Eielson Visitor Center to leave more time for hiking around.

Denali,"We decided the best way to get this off our bucket list and see as much as we could was to do a tour. We did--to the tune of way over $10,000. But I need to warn you about the cruise and tour. First of all, it takes 8 hours by train to get from Anchorage to Denali Park. Denali Park is over 6000 acres so just getting there does not mean you are close to the mountain. That is another 4 hour each way school bus ride, complete with four wheel humps and chairs appropriately sized for a child, not a 6'2"" adult. We did see 4 moose, caribou, and a ptarmigan (bird). Unfortunately, we did our entire trip and never saw a bear, but my camera saw hundreds of them. Hundreds. I am not exaggerating. And we never saw a wolf either, but I saw twice or three times wolves in the pictures. They were everywhere...sometimes just a few feet away. Our big disappointment was spending all this time to get to the mountain, and when we did it was shrouded in clouds to the point that there was no mountain. So they turn around and go 4 hours back. I saw pictures and it appears to me that the mountain is still a good distance away if we could have seen it. My boyfriend and I decided to try to come back and camp on the north side maybe if we live that long (no joke) so we can see it but frankly after seeing so many bears and wolves I am not sure about camping either.","August 28, 2018",Beautiful but disapponting,93,"Anderson, Indiana",3

Denali,"We spent two days in Denali National Park in late July. The first day we arrived around 9am and picked up our shuttle bus tickets for the next day. There was a bit of a traffic jam at the Wilderness Access Center as there was a moose grazing on some grass right on the side of the road.  We spent most of the first day exploring the park and some of the hiking trails in the area. We drove the first part of the park road to Savage River and took the loop trail. While we didn’t see much wildlife there (a few cute ground squirrels), there were some amazing views. It’s a relatively easy trail for most people. We also hiked part of the Taiga trail loop and connected with the Horseshoe Lake trail, accessed from the visitor center. This was a bit more strenuous, but not difficult at all. It was here that we saw a bit more wildlife, such as beavers at their dam and a moose drinking from the lake.  We also went to the dog kennels for the sled dog demonstration. It was a quick, but informative demo. There were a few dogs out for petting and a ranger there to answer questions. It was worth the stop, but don’t feel bad if you can’t make it there.  The second day we opted to take the shuttle/transit bus to Eielson Visitor Center. It wasn’t fancy, but it served the purpose. Our driver, Matt, described it as a “people mover” and that pretty much sums it up. He did offer some narration, bits of history and info about the park and the animals as well as stopping for any wildlife sightings. We did see four of the Denali “big five”, with the wolf being the lone holdout, but apparently it is highly unusual to see one.  We took the 7:30 am bus, thinking it would provide a better opportunity to see wildlife before the day got too warm. We saw lots of caribou, a few moose, Dall sheep and a pair of grizzlies running up a hill. The Eielson Visitor Center is nice, and if you desire, there are plenty of trails and other hiking to be done from there, plus some amazing views. There is also an abundance of ground squirrels there. One of the rangers told us that they have more squirrel bites occur than any other injury because people get too close to them. Our return bus did make several stops along the way to pick up other hikers headed back from either day trips or camping trips.  I think Denali is what you make of it, so be prepared to hike a bit, get dirty and have fun. Some people complained because they didn’t see lots of animals, but nature can’t be controlled. Go, explore and enjoy the natural beauty around you. Listen to the sounds (and silence) of nature.","August 26, 2018","A wonderful experience, more than just wildlife",31,,4
Denali,"This is the one tour you want to take because they have added 400x magnification cameras on the buses for this tour only. These buses have dropdown screens so you can view the wildlife. That dot they tell you is a moose you can actually tell. Even if you have your own binoculars they probably aren't of this magnification. My advice is to get close to one of these screens cuz you can take fabulous photos with your phone. Our driver was Brian and he knew his stuff. He also had the eye needed to spot animals. We saw dall sheep, moose, grizzlies with cubs, caribou, wolves, golden eagles, snowshoe hares and artic ground squirrels. They give you a nice brochure near the end of the trip with pictures of most of the wildlife you might see. There was a picture of a ptarmigan & I was going to jokingly complain that we hadn't seen any when Brian put on the brakes. There was a family of ptarmigan was crossing the road. No lie. I couldn't believe it. We saw the lower part of Denali but like so many others not the summit. With all the other stuff we saw this tour was amazing.","August 26, 2018",Wilderness Tundra Tour,2,"Venice, Florida",5

The tour driver was great, but we only saw a few caribou, a few passed in front of the road while we were sitting there. The highlight after that was a ptarmigan sighting and a few eagles. Then 7 hours of nothingness on a bus. No bears, no moose. Not that I expect they can control what wildlife is doing when and where, but also not worth sitting on a bus all day, even if you did see more wildlife. If you've seen the mountains, not really worth an all day bus trip to see them again.","August 21, 2018","If you've been to the Rockies or Sierra Nevadas, Meh.

Bears, elk, caribou, etc. You are on their land and home and it should be respected. It's certainly nothing to be afraid of- camping in bear country- but it is not for the careless. It's integral to be bear aware and follow the food rules. You must really be present out there and it's a wonderful feeling. Being present doesn't happen very often in our society anymore.","August 16, 2018",An jaw dropping expierence,15,"Appleton, Wisconsin",5
Denali,"I always have mixed feelings about this park. It's basically a Bus Tour National Park. The options for independent-minded travellers are quite limited. After the first 15 miles, you MUST take the concession busses to get into the park. They charge $40 for the typical Eielsen trip, and it's a long 8 hours on a school bus. Lots of port-a-potty stops; how much wildlife you'll see is variable (animals seem to be out more during nice weather). They don't advertise it, but you can get $10 bucks off your bus tickets if you have a Nat'l Park service pass and ask at the counter for the refund. They let you off the school bus to walk if you want; you then have to hope there's space on the next bus to pick you up (there's no getting off the more expensive guided tours, but these are mostly for the cruise ship passengers). I personally think it was a huge mistake not to finish paving the road so visitors could travel by themselves along the park road like at all other Nat'l Parks, but that will probably never happen (the bureaucrats think you should like being herded onto the busses -- and they make good money operating the bus tours). There's no place to really stay deep in the park unless you want to camp at bug-infested Wonder Lake or expensive-and-not-so-beautiful Kantishna. This means that almost everyone stays in cruise-ship-traveller-oriented ""Glitter Gulch"" (officially McKinley Park), which is good for getting a decent meal and buying a t-shirt, but little else. Your best best as an independent traveller is to try to win the Denali park road lottery and visit in September where you CAN visit the park independently. Otherwise, I'd probably spend my time in Alaska elsewhere, away from the crowds and the bus tours (it's very odd to me how few visitors travel around Alaska independently -- you don't need Princess Tours). The Denali Highway, west of the park, offers slightly less dramatic scenery but a much better independent travel experience. Try the MacLaren Lodge there.","August 16, 2018",Cruise ship passengers will enjoy; others may be disappointed,1192,"Philadelphia, PA",3

Denali,"Had been wanting to go on a Denali hiking since 2015 but due to its short timing of only a couple of months in summer and competing demands on my summer months due to work related ... finally did it!Extremely pleased with myself for doing a 5.5 miles hike from Mckinley Chalet Resort to the Wilderness Access Center (Bus Depot), Visitor Center (2.5 milles), 2 miles with a Park Ranger from the Visitor Center to Ridley Creek and another mile or so at the Savage River. Took another hike at the Horseshoe Lake Trail with views definitely not to be missed!A fulfilling trip to be able the see Denali itself, close encounter with mooses, squirrels, sled dogs and the mesmerizing views plus close contact with vast nature was sure an unforgettable experience. Stay at any of the properties in Denali Village for ease of access and shuttle services to the park Wilderness Access Center (Bus Depot), Horseshoe Lake Trail and Visitor Center, if you are not driving. From the Bus Depot we can take tours that go deeper into the park or if we are on a short trip of 2 - 3 days, my advice will be go with the Green Buses that cover the Ridley Creek and the Savage River loop by paying USD 10 Park Entrance Fee. Don't forget to go for the Dog Sled demonstration and take note of the daily showtime and shuttles are provided from the Visitor Center.For first timer, I will recommend to go for an educational hike to the Ridley Creek with a Park Ranger as this is also a daily scheduled event.If given another opportunity, I would do it again!","August 15, 2018",Another Off My Bucket List!,174,Kuala Lumpur,5

So that first afternoon we went to the park Rangers dog sled show. A very good show, probably the second best I have seen. Then we caught the park bus, free, and went in about 10 miles to the Vista exit where you could get a clear shoot at McKinley Mountain. It was quit the show. It was a good thing we did as the next day when we were on the tour that took us into the park, the clouds had moved in and you saw no mountains. While on the bus ride, we did see a grizzle mom with her cub; a number of caribou, many different types of birds, and mountain sheep. The bus had a nice screen, about 12 x 14, that pulled down, the driver could zoom in on something quit a distance away so we could get a much better look at the animal. The driver did not go as far into the park as we were told they would go. Best tip I can give is be aware of the weather.

Just book a bus tour with your hotel , and jump on a 8 hours bus trip , and if you are lucky , you will see Alaskan wildlife in its beauty: bear (and its cubs), caribou , moose , squirrels, eagle .... and many many many , in a protected area!

Denali,"You only see a small portion of the 6.3 million acres of the park but our trip was something we will remember for the rest of our lives. We are members of the 30% club. We got to see Mount Denali in all its glory for two clear sun shine filled days in a row! What a treat! The first day we took our car in 15 miles on the only road into the park. The second day we took a tour bus in 62 miles on the park road. We got to all types of wildlife from arctic ground squirrel, to moose, to many brown bear, golden eagles and caribou. The most memorable for us was the different views we had of Mount Denali. We also had a great memory of a Brown Bear chasing a caribou! ","August 13, 2018",Denali National Park and Preserve,27,,5
Denali,"Denali National Park has done it right! They only allow park buses deep into the park, which preserves the park and animals. Short hikes from the bus are allowed, and amazing. There are several hikes from the visitor center ranging from easy to hard with beautiful scenery and chance of wildlife. The visitor center is large and very informative.

Denali,"We only had a day to spend in Denali during our recent trip to Alaska so we took the Wonder Lake shuttle and were blown away by the scenery, the wildlife and the obvious joy and enthusiasm our shuttle driver showed throughout this very long ride. Denali (the mountain) usually only shows itself 30% of the time and it was our lucky day: we saw the peaks clearly from every possible vantage point. (When I saw photos of Denali, I always assumed they were retouched...not so! Breathtaking.) We also saw mama grizzlies playing with their cubs, caribou, Dall sheep, moose and more, all in their natural habitat.To be honest, if we had it to do over, we would have only traveled as far as the Eielson Visitor Center. Wonder Lake adds another 2 hours round trip and we didn't have enough time to truly explore the lake area. But we don't regret the longer ride at all! Just would have liked a little more time to hike around a bit.","August 11, 2018",Indescribable!,8,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Denali,"You can't control the weather so you have to go with the flow when visiting most of Alaska. We were here three days but never got to see the high one, Denali. We, however, saw 28 grizzlies in one day among a dozen other types of animals, silver fox, red fox, caribou, birds, hares, osprey, owls, etc. We took a transit bus all the way to the end, a long 92.5 miles each way but our driver was so funny, knowledgeable and friendly that the ride was painless and we learned a lot. His name was Bear - how fitting... We also saw the sled dogs and walked some trails. The place is well kept for the amount of people coming here each year (more than 650,000 and counting). My only comment is that they should have more staff in the visitor center. Each time we had a question the wait was longer than 20 minutes. Signs at the campground indicated they were all full. We asked anyway and it just happened that the person in front of us canceled her two nights - bingo - we were in during a busy weekend!!! Same for the transit bus. Don't despair if you haven't made reservations, things may still work out. A must see - polychrome mountains are amazing and so is the river, don't let the rain and clouds deter you.","August 9, 2018","When sunny landscape is what you are after, when raining, fauna",324,Canada,5

Denali,"Love this national park, but wish other visitors were more understanding. Visitors must do without the freedom to move about independently in their polluting vehicles because the need to protect Denali’s wilderness and wildlife is far too important. (One only need to read news articles of animal harassment, pollution and wildfires in national parks to understand.) The park is so vast, visitors may opt to endure lengthy bus rides to reach popular points of interest, or go off on their own to camp or hike the backcountry by permit. For those who won’t or can’t “rough it” or spend multiple days in the park, the experience can be overwhelming and will be exhausting — and you may not even see Denali / Mt. McKinley. (According to the park rangers, summer visitors have only a 35% chance of seeing the mountain due to weather/clouds. We were in the 65% club for both days.) In short, visitors need to be prepared — for changing weather, for discomfort, for awe and, yes, even some disappointment.Despite it all, I enjoyed my time at the park and am hopeful it will retain its peace and wildness — and that visitors will understand, not complain. We opted to take the green transit bus/shuttle and along the way to the Eielson Visitor Center saw a brown grizzly bear, and a couple blonde grizzly mama bears and frolicing cubs, caribou, dall sheep, a couple of wolves (lounging in the distance), ground squirrels, and a variety of birds.","August 7, 2018",Prepare for adventure or disappointment,541,"Gig Harbor, Washington",5

Bus Depot opens very early, clean restrooms, snacks & coffee available before you head out. Our bus driver was great. Highly recommend taking lunch with you as it will be a long day out.

Denali,"This is a huge park about 150 miles from Anchorage that surrounds Denali (formally Mt McKinley). We've visited all of the major parks and I rank this one just below Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon and just above Yosemite. So if you've seen those places go here next. It is a true wilderness park, accessible only on foot or by a 90 mile long gravel road. Private cars are allowed in only for the first 10 miles. You have to take a bus from there-- it takes 8-15 hours to do a round trip on a bus, depending on which tour you choose. Park buses will also drop you anywhere along the road and pick you up when you are ready. The mountain, Denali, is 20,000 feet and often shrouded in clouds so you may not see it. The rest of the scenery-- mountains and tundra-- is superb. We saw grizzles, caribou, foxes, moose, and Dall sheep. The Visitors Center and museum at the entrance are outstanding-- don't miss. There is also a sled dog display near the Visitors Center that is fun and very worthwhile.","July 27, 2018",One of the National Park gems,76,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

This is why we did the land tour on our own. Rented a car in Anchorage and the road was an easy drive all the way to Fairbanks. Don't be afraid to drive it! We rented 2 minivans for 10 people with all our luggage. It gave us so much freedom to explore the whole area of Denali and go to a lot of activities.

Denali,"There’s so much to see it’s difficult to begin. Travel in the park by private auto is prohibited so using a bus is the only alternative. Bus service is provided by private tour companies or by the park service itself. Park busses pick up and drop off day hikers and back country backpackers. We took a tour which went deep into the park, but still not all the way. On our tour we were fortunate enough to see a moose, two mother bears, one with a 1 year-old cub and the other with two 2 year-old cubs, an arctic fox and many caribou. Unfortunately, as is usually the case, Mount Denali was completely hidden by clouds.","July 20, 2018",An outstanding example of our National Parks,10,"Tolland, Connecticut",5

Denali,"Denali National Park is definitely a must-do when in Alaska. We took the regular park bus tour (the Tundra Wilderness tour) and highly recommend it. While these buses are similar to school buses, the seating is more comfortable. While their are no restrooms, the bus makes fairly frequent stops (every couple of hours or so), so this should not present a problem for most.We were quite lucky. When we got our first view of Mount Denali, there was not a cloud in the sky. By the time we made it to the final viewing area, there were a few light clouds but the peak was still clearly visible. The tour goes 63 miles into the park and lasts 7-8 hours.We say one grizzly bear, quite a few caribou, a fox, some Dall's Sheep and a number of birds.The daughter of friends happened to be climbing Mount Denali and by coincidence, she and her team reached the peak on the very day that we toured the park - June 27.","July 18, 2018",WOW!

We saw countless sheep, caribou, 3 Alaskan brown bears with 2 cubs each. We saw a couple moose with their calves. We also got great pics of Denali and the weather was great. That is not the norm.

Seems lame from the road but the demo was really neat. ,"July 15, 2018",Absolutely Amazing ,2,,5
Denali,"This is another great national park for seeing nature in a relatively undisturbed setting. Access to the park past a certain mile of the park road is limited only to busses from the park's concessionaire, in an effort to keep it as undisturbed as possible. Though the school-bus was a bit cramped and limited for viewing, I can see why this approach is preferable to the traffic jams and cars everywhere of parks like Yellowstone.One statistic we learned there, that would have helped set our expectations in advance, is that only about 30% of visitors actually see Denali. The rest of the time, it's covered in clouds. We were part of the 70%, so I felt a little disappointed and had to shift my expectations.That being said, though, we did see a lot of wildlife, including a large herd of caribou, grizzly bears, a fox and her babies, bald eagles, and more. Be sure to bring your binoculars and, if you want photos, a strong telephoto lens, because you see all of these things from a distance, to not disturb the animals.","July 15, 2018",Beautiful!,178,"Fox River Grove, Illinois",5
Denali,"Even though it's statistically unlikely, an attempt to view Mt. Denali would be worth it for even an obstructed view. We didn't realize until we arrived that it's actually the tallest mountain in the world (Everest is so tall because the surrounding land is so high above sea level). There are no words for its grandeur.","July 14, 2018",Denali Came Out for Us and An Astounding Experience We'll Never Forget,4,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Denali,"Denali is amazing to see in person - it is so huge. We first could see it from different points in Anchorage - which is over 150 miles away. Then we went to Denali National Park and the park road got us within 30 miles of it. You will hear that it is only visible 1/3 of the time because the mountain makes it's own weather - but we could see it on 3 different days from Anchorage and at least part of it both days at Denali (there were some lower clouds but we could see the snowy peaks. Bring a great camera that can zoom to 300 or more!We also learned why it's not called Mt McKinley anymore - American's basically renamed what the native Alaskan's had always called Denali, so rightly so it is back to it's original name!","July 14, 2018",Amazing - we wish we had stayed 3 days instead of 2!,19,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

Denali,"A group of 28 of us went by bus on a 7 hours tour of the park. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and pleasant. She had a camera with a zoom lens, so she could zoom in on wildlife, then put the picture on screens located on the bus. We got to see grizzly bears, dahl sheep, caribou, several types of birds and many different wild flowers. We were each given bottled water and a great little snack pack for the trip. There were restroom stops (be sure to take advantage of them), a few stops to stretch the legs and take short hikes, and a stop at a book/souvenir shop. Unfortunately, the weather was not great and we did not get to see the top of Denali itself, but the views and scenery were spectacular.","July 13, 2018",Breathtaking Tour of the Park,22,"Springfield, Missouri",5

Yesterday Denali was hidden in the clouds. Both experiences were fantastic!Mosquitos are vicious at Wonder Lake. Wear mosquito repellent and still plan to be bit. It happened both times. But do not be put off by mosquito.Do carry binoculars as many of the animal sightings are distant. But exploring Denali is a lifetime experience.

Cons:The buses are like school buses with small windows and uncomfortable seats. I wish it was possible to take personal cars. You can but you have to get a permit. We also felt that tour was rushed as we barely got 10 min at few sites to get out of bus and take pics. Could have been better if the guide was more interactive. Overall 4 stats for denali and 3 for tour.","July 12, 2018",Beautiful,21,"Houston, Texas, USA",4
Denali,We stayed at the park for a week. One day we saw Denali several times. The bus driver had told us that mornings were the best chance.

There is a pull off there with a great view. ,"July 11, 2018",Finally saw it! ,37,"Des Moines, Iowa",5

Denali,"We did the Tundra 8 hour trip and ok yeah the 1st 3 hours were boring not seeing wildlife but the deeper you get the better chances you see some and we did. Of course its all beautiful and when it's colder the animals love it and we visited in June. We saw a young blonde grizzly bear close to bus, 2 grizzly's far distant, a fox carrying pray, caribou, and ground squirrels. Make sure you make a trip yourself near the entrance you'll see a moose with her babies. We hiked and they were so close to us but you have to keep in your space and you'll be fine. And we also got lucky and had a clear view of Denali. I'd love to come back and do the 12hr when it's colder too. And beware some of that bus ride have huge drop offs so just look at mountains and it'll pass. Make sure you bring extra snacks. The bus provided plenty of water and our guide was great at stopping to see the animals.","July 10, 2018",8 or 12 hour a MUST!,142,"Madison, Alabama",5

It's truly amazing to look out over such massive landscapes that are completely unspoiled. You bus drive/guide makes the experience as they relate stories, history, and talk about the wildlife along the way.

Denali,One of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. I am still in awe. Not easy to see because it it so undisturbed but definitely worth the discomfort of sitting on the bus tour to see. So much wildlife that actually hasn’t been hassled by idiots who would bother them if allowed to. Because of the restrictions on entry to the park it is still actually a truly wild place. If you are into true backcountry hiking this would be your nirvana. Would be fantastic to see from the air as well. There are a couple of campgrounds within the park but I would imagine you have to book them way far ahead. Overall a spectacular experience and I would go again in a heartbeat,"July 9, 2018",Absolutely stunning place,2,,5

We were with HAL on a cruise+ Land tour, 9 days trip, it seemed we would get 2 days in Denali, but it turned out we got only only half a day in Denali (from noon to night). We did two excursions: rafting trip (Canyon Run) and air tour (Fly Denali). Both of them are extremely good and shows Denali in two different perspectives. However, there was so much more to see: the bus trip inside the park (the longer one, it seems the shorter bus trip is not great); UTV/ATV tours onto the mountain, trails/hikes.","July 7, 2018",Absolutely amazing place!,10,,5
Denali,"Unlike most other national parks Denali management keeps individual cars out of not of park which is good. Denail is not over run with tourists like Yellowstone. But to get deep into the park it is an 8 hour round trip bus ride. Long day. But we saw grizzlies sunning themselves, a couple moose, Dahl sheep. The views are spectacular. But order lower Alaska as the mountains are more imposing and all the water. If on the cruise package, recommend you not do the 9 hour train, 8 hour bus tour, followed by the 20 hour bus to the ship. Will come back to Denali as a family and camp in the area for a better experience. ","July 6, 2018",Long Day but Worth It,60,"Lexington, Massachusetts",4

I took the transit bus into the park as far as the Elson Visitor Center... another great spot to hike, enjoy nature and views of Denali. You can get on and off the bus at designated stops or just about anywhere you like. As you go up the mountains, the gravel road winds along the side with cliffs to your right and the valley on your left.

The main road into the park is only about 15 miles until only buses can continue. The best views of the mountain are from the highway and trapper creek south entrance. The road is all gravel so be careful. Denali is utterly beautiful but be sure to read weather forecasts to ensure you’ll see it.

A fox den that had four pups and a falcon nest that had three chicks in it. The driver had a camera that shows on the screens in the bus and she got us perfect views of the wildlife that was way off in distance. We saw moose, caribou, grizzly bear, Fox, falcons, dally sheep, mountain goats, tundra hare and a variety of birds.Our Alaskan trip ended on a very high note by visiting Denali, next time we will probably make the trip just to Denali!

Suggest you do research before going to this area there is much to know and do.It is beautiful during the summer month we went (July). It was a nice and easy drive from Fairbanks that was a little over 2 hours away. Near the entrance of the park go to the tourist information and get more info. It's hot during the summer and close to 100 degrees, do your homework and don't travel like we did with parkas suitable for the North Pole.","July 4, 2018",Remarkable views,73,"Nipomo, California",4

No need to go any further unless you want to say you went to the end for bragging rights. The visitor center at Mt. Denali is all you need. On our way up, we saw a Grizzly with two cubs, lots of caribou, several moose, a male Grizzly, sheep, and a variety of birds. Well worth the trip. What you should know up front is that if you plan on staying in the park, you may not travel the park except for the bus or by foot. You may not leave your campsite with a vehicle once you are in or actually are leaving for good. Make sure you have everything you need.","July 3, 2018",The Views....The Critter's....The Mountain!,1,"Bloomington, Wisconsin",5

Denali,"Spent almost 9 hours on a bus with bucket seats traveling 60 miles into Denali National Park. We had a fabulous time! Our driver and guide, MJ was the best I've ever had. She had two degrees in pertinent subjects on the animals and the ecosystem and 17 years experience in the park. We saw four of the big five animals, only missing the wolf. But with only 60 wolves in over 6 million square miles of wilderness it was a long shot to see one. We saw two sow grizzly bears with cubs, one with two newborn cubs breast feeding, Dall Sheep, Caribou, Moose with baby, red fox with kits and many other small animals. MJ explained the circle of life with Mother Nature. They don't interfere with nature, allowing boom and bust cycles as they would occur in nature without human intervention. They currently have a rabbit explosion, the overpopulation of rabbits will lead to an increase in predators on the rabbits as the food source is plentiful. As the rabbits consume most of the food, they will die off as will the predators in a 10 year cycle. I highly recommend this trip. It changed my perspective on National Parks. Take extra food, the snack box isn't much for the trip. If you get MJ (Mary Jane) you will have the best in the park.","July 2, 2018",Fabulous visit,11,"Camana Bay, Grand Cayman",5
Denali,"To come to Alaska, just cruise, and not visit Denali National Park does not make any sense. Here you will see a land beauty that you cannot see on a cruise. If you are lucky, as we were, you will see Denali and become part of the 30% club. Another suggestion is to go no later than June before the snow on the mountains melt or dissipate.We went on a school bus since cars are restricted and had an excellent guide.Right off we saw a few moose and caribou which he said was just lucky. In fact, he told us that sighting a grizzly bear happens on one out of twelve trips. We were lucky again. We did not go on an extended tour that started at 4:30AM and so glad we chose not to. Just couldn't get excited when a whole bus jumps up when they spot a moose. Also dahl sheep do not rock the boat. Other people who had been on a real safari in Africa felt the same way as us.It still is a must see when you go to Alaska but concentrate on the beauty of the land and all of the interesting stories about the ecology, environment and how the roads were built in this difficult terrain","July 2, 2018",Essential part of Alaska Visit,392,"Hartsdale, New York",4

But what did we see-6 grizzlies, moose, foxes, a wolf, caribou, dall sheep, beautiful mountains, rivers,,,sometimes that has to be enough. Of course you can't drive your car through the park so you take the Park bus for the 65 mile trip to view the mountain. It's not for the feint of heart. Some parts of the road are incredibly narrow and steep. The drivers do point out when they see animals and sometimes stop for pictures. But it's not a private tour bus. It does stop a few times for bathroom stops.The park is huge and can be dangerous for hikers not used to bear country. Come prepared.

Denali,"We heard the 30% rule, you know, that Mount Denali shows only 30% of the time. We were there in the park for 5 days and saw it every day. And glorious it was! You get accustomed to seeing large mountain peaks on the 90+ mile bus ride through Denali, but when 'the big one' shows itself, it is astounding and humbling when you see how it dwarfs the other peaks! The time we spent in Denali was the highlight of our month-long Alaskan adventure. We saw lots of bear, moose, wolves, caribou and birds. Hiking in the tundra was a new experience for us; like walking on a Temperpedic pillow top mattress. The park limits traffic, so there aren't a lot of cars and motor homes. That's why it is so pristine and wild still. Heart swells just recalling our visit!","June 25, 2018",Heart swells!!!,7,,5

We saw 12 bears (2 newborns, one 2 year old and four 3 or 4 year old cubs plus sows), 4 moose, many caribou, Dall sheep, a ptarmigan hen and chicks, a gyrfalcon, an owl and did some great hikes!

But the ride is well worth it: endless scenery and wildlife at almost every turn. Earlier in the day you have the best chance of seeing wildlife.

I reccomend stopping in the visitor center to get a map and taking a hike to the railroad bridge or to horseshoe lake if you're a beginner they are easy hikes. Be on the lookout for Moose and make sure you know what to do if you see them! same for bears - we didn't see any bears, but we did see plenty of moose on the trail, some a bit too close for comfort. The cafe is not too overpriced which is nice, and there's something for everyone. If you really want to see the park, take a guided tour - it's the only way to get past mile 15 and really see tons of wildlife. ","June 23, 2018",An amazing experience,4,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5

Denali,The national park of Denali is absolutely stunning. They have done everything to keep the park in its natural state as much as possible. You get enough opportunities to spot all types of wildlife and take pictures at pleasure. The drive through the park is scenic and most memorable. It is better to go early to witness snow on the mountains before majority of them melt down during the peak summer. But on the other side the trees would be quite dry and you would not see the actual color that you might see later part of the summer. Also the rivers would be flowing after the snow has melted. There is always a flip side to everything. Spend as much time as possible inside the park. You would definitely need one full at at least to enjoy the park.,"June 22, 2018",Stunning...DO NOT MISS,161,"Bengaluru, India",5

Denali,"This is a fantastic journey. We chose to use the shuttle rather than a tour bus and did not regret our decision. It is much cheaper, but you get a very good dialogue from the driver, and just the same views. We caught the 7.00 am bus from Wilderness Access Centre, which you need to book in advance . This is located at one mile on the Denali National Park Road and is well signposted. Remember seats on this bus are not allocated, so arrive early and try if possible to SIT ON THE DRIVER'S side. Our driver Tim, was superb, he had extensive knowledge of the Park and Wildlife. He went out of his way to point everything out, stopping the bus when wildlife was spotted and making sure that all had a view of it by moving the bus accordingly. We saw much more wildlife here in a day than we did in Yellowstone over a week. You can choose to stay at the destination and catch another bus back. We chose to return on the same bus.Be aware this is a long journey, It is 66 miles to Eielson, and the return takes approx 8 hours. You will need to take food and water with you as none is available in the Park.

On the way back, ask your driver to stop where you found an interesting spot to hike.

We saw four grizzly bears including a mom and her cubs, many caribou andoose including two big bull moose on the hill by the bus, Dall sheep on both sides of bus, golden eagles, snowshoe hares and even a wolf chasing a caribou. Now these are not all seen each time, but early morning is your best chance and the best chance to see Denali as clouds move in every day as the day goes on. We saw it crystal clear on our days. Get your fitness in before you come so you can hike every day and not struggle. We prepped well and did 12 miles on Three Lakes Trail easily. If not in really good shape, go out two miles on Three Lakes Trail as it is relatively flat and beautiful along the raging river. We saw a momma moose and her two claves there.Bring your own firewood (it is $10 for a tiny bundle here), water and lots of drinks and snacks for hiking. Get bear mace ahead of time. Most of all, bring your camera with zoom lens if you have one or can borrow one. Practice how to take a panoramic pic on your cell phone.

Because of this, we were allowed to drive all the way up to mile 30 (my understanding is they normally stop private vehicles at mile 15). The winter visitor center was open and had some fun hands-on things to do, but a TINY gift section (I've heard the normal giftshop is amazing). There were still a number of cars around, but we had plenty of ""alone"" time and saw nothing I'd consider a crowd. At one point, we took one of the small hiking trails and it was more of an adventure than we bargained for. Melting snow left deep puddles and a section of it wasn't cleared. They were obviously still preparing for the tourist season to start in the next week. However, the bathrooms and dog sledding part were both open.The first day, we arrived in the afternoon and spent hours taking pictures of the beautiful snowy scenery, but saw little wildlife.

You are pretty much on a bus the whole time, except for a few stops, and if you choose to get off yourself. We are used to doing our own thing when we visit a Park, and Denali really doesn't offer that option given the time restraints you have to get in and back out.

There are many scenic overlooks to stop at and take great pictures as well as wildlife running around. If you want to drive the entire road you have to do so through a tour company. Highly suggest doing this to anyone visiting Alaska.","April 30, 2018","Beautiful, Take Bus",62,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

We saw about 11 bears and lots of other wildl life and were very lucky to see the Denail moutain in her full glory. The bus driver was nice but she was a bit of a stickler, It was quite funny when soomeone would yell stop and only to find it was a rock. Some people have some serious photoography equipment which you were not allowed to stick more then 2 inches out the window. I only booked in advance 1 day pass so was kicking myself that it was fully booked out for the next day as I wanted to book in for a hike.

We stopped whenever we saw wildlife~black bear, grizzly bears, moose, rabbits, golden eagles, dall sheep, owl, ptarmigan,pika, ground squirrels, and of course, lots of flora and fauna.

Unless you have a significant amount of time to invest in the getting away from the main camper road that limits the park access, you are limited in the kind of ""back-country"" hikes that you'll experience. There are no ""best trails"", just map and a compass. Still, it is a beautiful unique place with lots of wildlife. ","January 21, 2018",Different than I expected.,6,LIBERTYVILLE,4

The drivers are excellent but if you have any sort of fear of heights, you'll quickly learn to close your eyes. The wildlife was spectacular and the guides were excellent spotters. All in all, it was about an eight hour trip into the park and to our accommodations: Danali BackCountry Lodge. Worth every minute of time and scary precipices!!!

Four different sets of a mother with two cubs and two males. We saw a confrontation with a male approaching two cubs when the cubs had wandered away from their mother. But she quickly returned to her cubs when she became aware of the male approaching. We also saw Dall sheep, moose, two herds of caribou, individual caribou, arctic squirrel, ptarmigan, and fox. Did not see the mountain until the next day during our train ride to Anchorage. Views then were great and have many photos.I will return!

Denali is a remarkable place that conserves landscapes, wildlife, and natural resources within its six million acres. It is the third largest national park in the nation.The highlight of a trip to Denali is a chance to see Mt. Denali, North America's tallest peak. Denali dominates the Alaska Range, standing over 20,000 feet high.One of the best ways to see and understand Denali is with a Tundra Wilderness Tour, a bus tour on the famed Denali Park Road.

Denali,"We scheduled 2 maybe 3 days here but only spent one in the park. There is no question it is a place of amazing beauty but the hours in the bus are too long for us, we prefer to be on our legs when visiting national parks.The bus drivers are lovely people who work hard to ensure everyone is enjoying themselves and try very hard to spot wildlife and talk to the passengers (they are not required to) all while driving some dangerous roads.We took one of the first shuttles and were lucky to see moose immediately, later in the trip we saw caribou, big horn sheep, a bear all at far distances and my wife and a few others saw a wolf. This is true wildlife in extremely wide open spaces so they are difficult to see even with binoculars. Although I felt our wildlife viewing had been somewhat disappointing when we changed shuttles and took a later one to return we found that those passengers had seen nothing on their way in and we saw almost nothing on our return journey.Of course wildlife is only part of the Denali experience, unfortunately the weather was not great so we could not see all of the famous mountain but luckily we had seen it the day before and also saw it perfectly on our return to Anchorage the following day.Loved the hiking out at Eielson, climb to the lookout!

Denali,"We went on the Tundra Wilderness Tour, which was an eight-hour bus trip of Denali. I was so excited to take this tour and to see some of the large animals of Denali. Well, all our bus driver did was talk and talk and talk. She had a memorized spiel that took the entire eight hours. Instead of looking for animals, she talked. She relied on the other bus drivers with hand signals to let her know if there were any animals when she should have been looking. At one point, the entire bus yelled at her to stop so that we could see a caribou, but she replied, well there are some up here. My husband and I spotted a bear in the distance, but by the time you caught her attention because she was talking, you were too far away to see anything. Of course, what did she stop for? The state bird, little brown ptarmigans, on the side of the road. Just what I didn't want to see. This was my biggest disappointment of my two-week Alaska vacation. We ended up seeing ptarmigans, an owl flew by, a couple of caribou, and, of course, a glimpse of a bear. Near the end of the trip, she paused in her eight-hour droning for us to reflect on the majesty of Denali for all of 30 seconds. The mountains themselves were beautiful, but we were unable to see Denali because of clouds on this day. As to mobility issues, all you need to be able to do is get on and off a bus, and there are plenty of stops to use a restroom.","October 26, 2017",You Talk Too Much,25,"Dover, PA",3

In celebration of our 60th wedding anniversary, my wife and I decided on an Alaska adventure and checked out several travel agencies to set our trip up. We chose Holland America based on our own reviews and recommendations of friends and family. What a wonderful trip! Flying into Fairbanks, we began our land tour to include Fairbanks, Denali, Anchorage and Seward. The most spectacular part was Denali, where we were part of the just 30% that got to see the mountain in clear weather! All land hotels were great and the observation trains to Seward were unforgettable. Boarding the NOORDAM in Seward, we enjoyed the final seven days of our twelve day trip, stopping in Haines, Juneau, Ketchikan and ending in Vancouver, Canada.

Walk around the lake, see the beavers dam and enjoy the beauty of the greenery around. this might take 2 hrs. Mount healy overllook trail - this trail is steep from beginning to the end. There is paved road at the start for some distance then it is a rocky road which gets very steep and hard towards the end. But the view from the top is amazing and it is extremely cold at the top. I would give ~4 hrs. Coming down is lot easier and fasterSecond day take the bus tour into the national park Ensure to book a bus tour earlier. The bus tour has several stops in between where you can hop on and hop off. You can hop off, go on a hike and hop back in. Along the ride we got to see several bears, moose and caribou. Our driver was very nice to stop for a while each time we sited an animal. To view Northern lights and Denali peak you are the mercy of mother nature so i would say not to have much hope.

We stayed for two days at the McKinley Chalet Resort and had plenty of time for the day long Tundra Wilderness tour. We rode on a school bus with video screens to see the wildlife up close and we were fortunate to see many of them. At the time we visited the park in early September, we saw moose, griizzly bears, Dall sheep and caribou and plenty of smaller wildlife. Our expert tour guide (23 years of experience) was extremely knowledgeable and informative about the entire park. We were lucky to have him as a tour guide and we were his last tour of the season. Tip: Sit on the left side of the bus, behind the driver, as much of the action took place on that side. The wild life was far from the bus so taking a camera with a zoom lens is best or use binoculars. If you don't have either one, the tour guide made sure you could see the animal close up on the video screen. We made many stops along the way with the usual warning to not stray from paths given wild animals do roam everywhere. We were warned what to do if bears, moose or wolves confronts us. When we stopped at Polychrome Pass, the views were spectacular and we were able to see Denali 30 miles away. We are now one of the 30% to actual see and take photos of Denali.

People who took the tour on or before 14 September got the full package & saw several bears, wolves & moose. We did ours on Friday 15 September & had to accept the shorter tour with a 6AM start (such that the first hour was in darkness) - we did see a couple of moose but in poor light & nothing else.We were lucky to see the mountain (Denali which is the highest in North America) - many do not as it is masked by clouds for at least two thirds of the time).","September 28, 2017",Marred by late change in itinerary,25,"Norfolk, UK",4

They are somewhat cramped and temperature is hard to control to please everyone, so dress in layers.

Our tour bus driver, Danny, was very informative, funny, witty, and had a great eye for spotting the wildlife. We had such a good time!","September 14, 2017",Amazing!,102,"Chattanooga, TN",5
Denali,"The bus ride takes 8 hours, so this is a whole day experience. And that is if you ""only"" go to the Eielson Visitor Center. Wonder Lake is another 2 hours and $20 a person. If the mountain is out (it was not for us) the view would be great from Eielson, so I would not recommend going on to Wonder Lake. Driver was friendly and knowledgeable; stopped frequently for scenery and wildlife viewing.Wildlife was abundant in the morning (we started at 7:30) but the last 2 1/2 to 3 hours was completely non-existent (in the afternoon).Please take them seriously: THERE IS NO FOOD AVAILABLE IN THE PARK. If with children this is especially important: bring all you will need for the day. You are asked to eat on the bus, so no crumbs or garbage gets into the park, and keeps it as wild as possible. And bring water--it is only available at the visitor centers.We did not take any extra time to do any hikes, and did not need insect repellent. Hikers and campers likely will.","September 14, 2017",This is a must do!,49,,5

We saw rams, ewes, grizzly with cubs, Caribou, Moose, and many other animals. Bring a good camera preferably with telephoto to get great shots!Snack box was okay, but pack a sandwich if you can.

Denali,"A visit to the state Alaska is definitely a treat! You will look in wonder and amazement of the grandeur and magnificence of Denali, the tallest mountain in North America. And, sometimes when the clouds lift, you will be able to see the top of Denali and understand why the indigenous people call this mountain ""The Great One"". Denali.This mountain sits in the midst of six million beautiful acres. You might have the opportunity to see bears, caribou, grey wolves, Dall sheep, and bald eagles from afar; and if you are lucky you may see them up close; especially a bear or a moose. As you travel throughout Alaska and walk through designated trails there are plenty of signs with explanations of what to do if one encounters a moose or bear!Stops and explorations in the cities of Anchorage, Ketchikan, Icy Pointes Straits; Hoonah Village, Talkeetna, Scagway,Juneau, Denali Village and Fairbanks revealed gems and increased my knowledge on many things. The gold rush times were treacherous times; not idyllic as seen in Hollywood movies. The movies always portrayed folks at the streams or mines getting the gold. We are not told of the what it took to get to this gold. How many individuals are aware that Japan occupied Alaska during the early part of WW II? Or there is a difference between Alaskan Huskies (that still pull sleds in the winter) and dogs used for for dog sled racing (Iditarod)?The Northern Lights are a sight to behold if you are lucky enough to catch them in the wee hours of the morning. And the fresh fish! If you love salmon, halibut, and crabs..., oh boy, the freshest seafood that you could never get in your hometown!","September 13, 2017",The Last Frontier,5,"Detroit, Michigan",5

Denali,"We took the Back Country Adventure to see as much of Denali Park as possible. As is often the case, it was a cloudy day and Denali was never seen. The bus driver indicated this was not unusual, as she saw the mountain maybe 10 times in a summer's worth of driving. But we saw many different wild life.A grizzly bear was spotted a couple hundred yards away. As we sat watching in the bus, the bear made it way toward us. The bear, seemingly oblivious to us on the bus, walked on the road within 18 inches of the bus. AMAZING!!! Our tour saw moose, caribu, dall sheep, bald eagles, fox, wolverine, and ptarmigan. Each time wildlife was spotted, the bus was stopped so all could view.Regulations in Denali prohibit any interaction with wildlife to maintain the natural aspects of the park. An intelligent way to manage things. The park road is narrow and well maintained.At times, when meeting other buses on the road, it can be scary. The road is narrow, and at times I was looking at the precipice of a many thousand foot drop off. These drivers are very good!The trip makes for a very long day; 12-14 hours. At the end of the road is a resort where a buffet lunch was served. Well worth the time and money.","September 12, 2017",Amazing Animal Sitings,4,"Tyngsboro, Massachusetts",5

Our tour guide was great, funny and informative, but I can't remember his name (but I do remember he was from Long Valley NJ) Saw a few moose and dahl sheep, nothing up close, but still worth the trip.

Second night spent in Healy, not much there, but 49th State Brewing was great. So, we had a fun trip, the disappointment was the park.I was aware of the ""no driving, take a bus ride"" way of seeing the park. While others have enjoyed it I just am not that into nature to ride a school bus for 8-12 hours...not gonna happen! We drove in the 15 miles and went for a hike, was nice, but overall disappointed in the park.

It was also a gray day like so many others in Alaska due to the state’s presence in a temperate rain forest environment. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our time in the presence of North America’s tallest mountain at 20,310 feet as well as the rest of the tour that brought us close to a lot of wildlife.

We were on a ""school bus"" for almost eight hours. We were given a box of great snacks. Our tour guide had a movie camera with super zoom lens. When any of us spotted an animal she would zoom in for a very good close up that we could view on an overhead pull down screen. We did see several grizzlies, one with two cubs, a moose with her calf, ptarmigan, fall sheep and the most impressive peak of Mt. Denali, formerly called Mt. McKinley.

Denali,"Must admit I had high expectations for our visit to Denali NP during our recent Princess Cruise trip in Alaska. Have been to East Africa on several safaris so I was used to seeing loads of wildlife on a typical game drive. And, yes, am well aware of animal activity as influenced by season, time of day, weather, etc. And, one really can not compare being in a safari vehicle with say 2 or three other occupants with a pop-up roof with being in a large bus with 40 plus occupants, foggy windows, and the like while attempting to take photos. No question, the landscape is amazing, extensive and varied. The vast valleys, wandering rivers, high peaks, nooks and crannies and a wonderful mix to trees, shrubs and ground vegetation create a beautiful setting unrivaled by anything I have ever seen. I was not impressed by the number of inhabitants we saw on our one day trip into the park nor the time on the train while traveling thru portions thereof. Would I go again if the opportunity arose. Perhaps, but I would explore other means to check out the park.","September 6, 2017",Exciting but disappointing,180,"State College, Pennsylvania",3
Denali,This is a really stunning place to visit. My only criticism is the quality of the buses that you need to use to see the park. They are old school buses and there is a divide in the window where you need to look out. Also when you do see a bear or wolf the time spent in front of it is too short as the poor bus driver has to keep to a timetable and move on. I feel they need to organise other bus journeys which are not dependent on a timetable. Lots of beautiful walks to discover and an informative information centre,"September 6, 2017",Fabulous National park with stunning views.

Denali,We were hoping to get to see Denali Mountain (Mt. McKinley). One of our guides said that only 45% people actually get to see it. Even if you can't see it the other mountains and ranges are fabulous to just look at. While we were there they had their first snow fall on some of the lower mountains. The Denali Natural Park is beautiful to see different wildlife and grass lands. The National Park has guided bus tours of different lengths of time. These park buses are allowed to travel into parts of the park the public can not go. I would recommend that families with younger children should take short tours.

While on the road out to the mountain we were 50 miles out when we were privileged to see the mountain top. It was STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL. Buy the time we drove the next 30 miles to our turn around point , the clouds had covered the top. Our tour guide said that we were amongst the 30% fortunate enough to see the mountain top. Don't let that discourage you from booking the long tour into the park. It's an adventure you won't soon forget. Bring your best camera and you telephoto lens and snap away.

This is an easy hike through the tundra and next to the river. On the hike you may begin to comprehend the vastness of the park. Only a Very small portion has been touched by man. What you see are wild animals in their true wilderness. We took the early morning Tundra Wilderness tour bus - 7-8 hours round trip deeper into the park. Our guide, Bryan has degrees in biology and geology and was very knowledgeable as well as friendly. We saw 13 grizzly bears, herds of dall sheep, and several moose. Each time he would stop the bus and explain more about the animals. The highlight was at the turn around stop. The clouds parted and we could see Denali mountain. This is a huge mountain! Truly spectacular! The sun shone down on the snow at the top and it appeared to be glowing. Really indescribable. The tour provides a box snack, water and stops several times at bathrooms.

Denali,"We decided to take a 12 hour bus trip into the park since you can only drive to mile 15 in your own vehicle. The bus tour we picked took us to mile 92 the end of the road called Kantishna Experience. The tours are operated by Aramark a concessionaire contracted by the National Park Service to operate the bus tours and other park concessions. You have the option of two type of buses to travel to Kantishna. We chose the more expensive tour (Brown Bus) because it was going to be narrated by the driver plus part of the trip was also narrated by a Park Ranger plus your given a box lunch along with snacks and drinks. The other option of bus ride (Green Bus) was one where you given a ride to your destination with no guarantee of narration although we were told it was up to the individual bus driver if he or she wanted to offer an ongoing narration of your travels. The bus driver we had on the more expensive tour was Ken he let us know that he infact drives both types of buses and offers the same narration on either type of bus. Our Tour you stay on the same bus for entire trip with plenty of input from the driver on Animals, Park Info, Native Culture plus answers to any questions you may have about the park or its surroundings. You have multiple rest room stops (approx every 1-1/2 hour) multiple visitor center and photo taking opportunities including multiple chances for photos of Denali the Mountain especially if its visible (which it was the day of our tour). You stop for photo opportunities at every animal spotting when a passenger hollers STOP Ken slowed to a stop and everyone had the opportunity of photos (you do not get off the bus at these animal stops) The other Green Bus was more of a shuttle type of operation where you purchase a ticket to various destinations along the internal park road you can get off at your destination spend time hiking or taking pictures hike to a different stop then flag down another green bus and get a ride back to the bus depot. The green bus from what we could determine is that it also makes the bathroom stops, and the animal viewing stops.Your decision on which bus tour to take should be based on your individual needs. There are approximately 4 various destinations on the Green Bus the cost for the Kantishna destination is $51.00 each referred to as Non Narrated Transit Buses. The cost of our tour on the Brown Bus was $192.00 each. We had a very enjoyable day with views of Mt Denali, plus animal spottings of Grizzly Bears, Moose, Golden Eagle, Dall Sheep, Grouse, Ptarmigan (State Bird) , Caribo, and Snowshoe Rabbits.Be sure if what ever tour you decide on to make reservations in advance.

She talked non-stop on the way to the Road House, giving us great information on the park, the animals, and the history. Along the way we saw bear, moose, caribou, ptarmigan, spruce grouse, and too many other birds and animals to mention. At the Road House we had a sandwich and soup lunch, then had options for activities. Most of us attended the dog sledding demo. The young man that did the demo was entertaining and enlightening. The dogs were not the typical Iditarod dogs, they were loaners from a family that did not train for that. His Iditarod dogs were too serious for casual demos, and he didn't want to risk injuring them. They need to be brought back to conditioning after a summer of relaxation. At the end of the demo we headed back to the entrance. Linda was quiet for part of the time so guests could take a little nap, but she would stop for animals and get on the microphone to point them out. It was a long day, but with all of the stops and information the trip went rather quickly. It was well worth it. The best part was that on the way out we saw the mountain in the distance.

Denali,"You spend a lot of money to see Denali Nat'l Park & Preserve. We sure did. And, yes, we can say we've been there. Mpst of the reviews I've read rate it a ""5"". To some extent I think folks are reluctant to admit that they spent big bucks for an OK experience. Hence my tempered comments.....We've seen the open spaces, untouched land, mountains & valleys, wildlife (grizzlies; carabou, dall sheep, etc). It takes an 8 hour bus ride into the park to do this. And, yes, we will probaly never be in any more of a remote place in our lives. It's exciting for awhile. Our driver/interpreter was extremely well informed & articulate (almost to a fault). The (unpaved) road is rough & the bus ride gets to you after awhile. There are some turns in the road where you do not want to look down. When the driver asked us, "" how far down do you think it is to the valley?"". The answer was, "" about 14 complete flips of the bus"". A few other points: 1. go into town & buy subway sandwiches the night before to take with you on the bus ride. 2. July & August are the 2 rainiest months, assume you will not see Denali (we did not). In our case, considering it takes a day to get there from Anchorage, a second day for the 8 hour tour, and a third day to get back to Anchorage, we asked ourselves, ""was it worth it?"". We decided ""no"". We could have spent those 3 days more effectively by doing something else.So -- our advice -- if you decide to go, set reasonable expectations.","August 27, 2017",The Good & Not So Good of Denali National Park,24,,3
Denali,"A stunning place. Saw lots of animals BUT our guide would not shut up. Did not know how somebody could talk for 7 hours straight. Did we need to know her helicopter exam score. Much of the information was good but it was repeated over and over. Guide was obviously used to having kids in the bus. Read out a good poem and had some great quotes of the peace and tranquility in the park. We just would have liked to have sampled some of it. The bus is poorly maintained as they windows could not be opened or closed easily.Look it is still a great tour in a magical place. Just hope you get a guide that bows that sometimes, silence is golden.","August 26, 2017",Great BUT,24,"Adelaide, Australia",3
Denali,"Traversed by rivers, streams, braided watercourses and waterfalls, this immense expanse of National Park covers a range of vegetation from spruce to taiga to Alpine/Tundra which changed the further we drove into the Park.The landform ranged from flat river valleys to undulating ground to steep precipices and snow-covered peaks in the background.The colours were amazing and ranged from pink to deep purple, cream to orange and red depending on the light and the natural colour of the soil.We were lucky to see, in the distance, herds of cow caribou, several grizzly bears and lots of birds. Unfortunately Denali was shrouded in cloud so we didn't get to admire her.This is a lovely, unspoilt area.

Denali,"We were lucky and joined the so-called ""30% club."" The mountain came out for a short while when we were on our early morning ""Tundra-Wilderness"" tour. That tour is really the way to get deep into the park (maybe 50 miles in). We did this as part of a Holland American cruise-land extension, but anybody can do these. They take you on a sort-of converted school bus (converted because they put nicer bucket seats in them). On that 7 or so hour journey, we saw Grizzly bears, moose, Dahl sheep, caribou, red fox, and wolves... the full package! Evidently only about 10% of visitors see wolves, and the 3 we saw came to within 10 feet of the bus.The driver was an excellent guide.

Denali,"Denali National Park in Alaska is an amazing experience. Some people see more wildlife than we saw, but the natural beauty of the mountains and the varying vegetation is remarkable. The park is very well run and suited to visitors of varying physical abilities. My husband and I did ""gentle"" hiking, while my son and daughter-in-law did more strenuous hikes (as in significant stiffness and pain, but still worth it according to their reports). We very much appreciated the restrictions on how far cars can go into the park because that eliminated the horrific traffic jams we experienced last year in Yosemite. Any staff member we encountered was helpful, kind and informative. If you are in good physical shape and have several days to visit, camping and backpacking would undoubtedly be a phenomenal experience. Definitely wear layers that included a fleece jacket/sweatshirt and raingear. You have to assume you will deal with rain most days in Alaska. Also gloves and a winter hat are strongly recommended. So start planning your trip. You will be glad you did.","August 22, 2017",A natural wonder that should not be missed!,10,New Jersey,5

Denali,We really enjoyed our school bus style Princess trip into the Denali National Park. It only goes about 15 miles into the park but we managed to see a moose and her calf up close and some birdlife .Not much for 5 hr return trip but it was a picturesque drive . I would love to have had more time to explore this expansive wilderness.Our driver Steve was very experienced and knowledgeable (retiring next month after 21 years as a driver) . There are no toilets on these buses.There was a woman who did an interesting oral narration about the cabins and the delightful young Interpretive guide who told us about her Indigenous family tribal customs in this region. The tour companies need to tell people to listen to the guides first and then go to the toilets as we were waiting in the cold wind for ages for people to gather for the guides talk and the lines for the toilets were very long.In this section of the park it is extremely busy with endless buses and very limited facilities to cope with the crowds . The Visitor's Centre is well worth a visit and don't miss the film of DNP .The shuttle buses are free and run every 30 minutes .We stayed at the Denali Princess Lodge and it was very comfortable and convenient .Great shopping here .,"August 20, 2017",Pristine Wilderness,9,"Tamworth, Australia",5
Denali,"We spent one day at Denali National Park--we apparently thought we were getting a campsite with electric and didn't, so we stayed at accommodations outside the park.But the one day at Denali was one of the best days of my life.We took a bus tour from the park visitor center to Eielson, about 66 miles into the park.We were at the visitor center at 6AM to get the on the first bus. Our bus driver Manuel was hilarious. It's painful getting up that early but I really recommend it as it was 4 to 5 hours to Eielson, mostly on unpaved roads, some of them narrow mountain roads with no guardrail. We saw and stopped for grizzly bears, caribou, and mountain goats.There were a couple rest stops but don't expect sinks or modern bathrooms everywhere you stop in the park, or in Alaska for that matter. I had a pack of sanitary hand wipes I used often.At Eielson we climbed an ""un-named"" mountain, probably about 4000 to 5000 feet, not too bad of a climb, saw amazing views of the park at the peak.It's a good idea to wear layers of clothing and take a back pack, be prepared. Hiking poles will help.It was about 5PM when we got back to the visitors center, we could have gone out to Wonder Lake but it would have added 3 to 4 more hours to the day.The days are longer in the summer though--it didn't get dark until after 11PM.All in all this is a bucket list experience.

We were lucky enough to travel through on a sunny , pleasant day and we were rewarded with lots of views of wildlife - saw everything but a wolf ( which is a rare sighting anyway)I was surprised by the park ranger's mini program on mining in the park and enjoyed our stop at the Quigley cabin - it was both informative and a good opportunity to stretch our legs . I didn't expect that ... it was a nice surprise . Craig navigated the turns on the road with real experience and finesse ... He made a 12 hour bus ride seem so much shorter . It is truly refreshing to spend time with someone who is happy and loves what they do ! We LOVE Denali and we can't wait to return again . This was our 3rd time visiting the park , and we were happy to celebrate its 100 th anniversary . We also saw the beautiful and educational visitor center , took a nice hike nearby , visited the sled dog kennels for a wonderful presentation by Ranger Omar and the kennel staff , and drove out to the Savage River stop and did the beautiful loop trail there ...

I hemmed and hawed about riding a bus for so long to see more than just the trails near the visitor center! (Although our first little hike on the Horshoe Lake Trail reveled a Moose and her calf, munching away in the lake!) I did finally concede and we got onto one of the green shuttle busses, rode for about 2 1/2 hours, got off at an overlook and caught a bus back to the entrance. The busses are old school busses, painted green. They were fairly comfortable and they are air-conditioned!We saw a great deal of wildlife on our short trip! I couldn't believe how many animals just walk down the road! The drivers are great about stopping, pulling over, and telling you about the animals. We were able to see a grizzly sow and her two cubs, a male grizzly, lots of caribou, a coyote, and ptarmigans. It's a little crazy and very exciting! The park was hazy from wildfires to the west, when we were there, but you could still see the majesty of this 6 mil acre park!

I little hint for the people who are no pilots: There is a spot at the left side of the street coming from Anchorage shortly before you reach Talkeetna. When you see the mountain from there, the weather is good enough- there are couple of companies offering sightseeing flights. Check out the equipment.

We did both and were glad we did. From the plane we were able to see the summit of Denali and then land on a glacier. We also saw several animals deep within the park. From the bus tour we were able to see more of the ground-eye view of the park and its animals. We also did a short hike from the visitor center. The park is massive and impossible to completely explore, but we made a good effort in a couple of days.","August 3, 2017",The last frontier,167,Austin,5
Denali,"This park is incredible and so vastly untouched by humans! There are relatively few people compared to other parks. The mountain is amazing and can be seen from many vantage points. Visitors (unless they have a special pass) can only drive personal vehicles 13 miles, then it's just bus traffic. Trails are well maintained and there are lots of family activities. I love this park!!! ","August 2, 2017",Breathtakingly beautiful!,26,"Sonoma County, California",5
Denali,"Thus my fourth time to Denali. Never fails to make me feel so grateful for this National Park. The beauty is indescribable. You have to experience the vastness of it all. We did the Kantishna experience tour with our daughter and her family. We are now in the 10% club who have seen Denali in her splendor without clouds. Saw grizzly twins with Momma bear, moose, Caribou, porcupine, eads, birds and more caribou. Walked on tundra. Great tour. Sheryl Paxton was our tour guide, great driver.","August 2, 2017",Denali 2017,20,"Tucson, Arizona",5

Denali,"If you are visiting Alaska on a cruise, make some time before or after to come up to Denali. We did it before our's and were thankful we did. When you first come in the park there are trails around there and plenty of wildlife that you don't really need to take any of the bus tours. But if you do have time we took the one out to the Eileson visitors center. It was an all day round trip. You need to bring your own food and water, although you will be able to refill water bottles. Our trip was not a tour so the driver wont be talking the whole time, but they do go out of their way to stop for wildlife.","August 2, 2017",Must do if visiting Alaska,66,"Coral Springs, Florida",5
Denali,Only 30% of visitors see even a portion of the mountain. Only 8% get to see the whole thing unobstructed. We got very lucky and got to see the whole thing despite the forecast being 80% chance of rain.,"August 1, 2017",Great views if you are lucky,137,"Saint Charles, Missouri",5
Denali,"We were very lucky, the mountain cooperated and wanted to be seen and photographed. Make sure you do at least the Wilderness Tour, it really gets you into the park and the 6-8 hours is worth the investment in time. We saw Grizzlies, Caribou, Dall Sheep & Golden Eagles. oh and also saw this little hill called Denali, but Polychrome pass is unbelievable.","August 1, 2017",Breathtaking,90,"Bellmore, New York",5
Denali,"I'm not sure what to say except that is so pristine and beautiful. We took the Kantishna bus and had a great time. We took the shuttle bus and not the tour. This worked out fine for us. If you don't have the time to go all the way to Kantishna, I would recommend at least trying to go to Eilson. Eilson has a wonderful visitor center.Nothing is guaranteed when you go in the park. It is not a zoo, so while the animals are there, you may or may not get to see them. Same with Denali. It is only visible 30% of the time. We did see the mountain on our way there, but the 3 days we were in the park, it was cloudy. Even though, we had a really great time. The views are breathtaking. However, if you do miss some of animals you were hoping to see, take a trip to the Anchorage Zoo. They have bears, dall sheep, moose, wolves, fox, etc... As for the mountain, hopefully your stay in Alaska will be long enough that the mountain will peek out from the clouds. I purchased a photo book with all kinds of amazing photography of Denali. It's not the same, but it's up to mother nature.","August 1, 2017",Love Denali,35,United States,5
Denali,If you are fortunate enough to get good weather this is a spectacular place. We visited the park and did a flight see of the Mountain. Incredible views and terrain. We were surprised that we did not see more wildlife in the park but the harsh terrain prohibits the vegetation necessary to sustain more. An incredible ecosystem at work here. ,"July 31, 2017",A Walk on the Wildside,168,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",5
Denali,"This is an amazing place to visit. I think it is difficult to rate objectively as everyone will have a different experience, but if anyone has an opportunity to visit they should! We were very fortunate to have a great bus driver and to have seen the big five during our visit. We took the 7-9 hour tour. I think this was the ideal length for our family. Had we done the short tour I think we would have missed out on most of the wildlife, but I think the longer tour would have been too much for our girls (12,10). They did enjoy watching for wildlife and scenery, but also had books along to keep them occupied when there was not as much going on. The tour included a fairly large snack box with some healthier snacks and bottled water. There was an opportunity for a port a potty type restroom every 1-1 and 1/2 hours. I would encourage everyone to spend some time here.","July 30, 2017",Natural Beauty,36,"Hugo, Minnesota",4

Denali,Please don't go here expecting or looking for a larger Yellowstone or Glacier NP. This is a unique and special area all its own. The park is very well maintained and has excellent services. I would strongly rec for non adventure hikers to take a nature bus tour. For those with interest in strenuous hiking - there is a wealth of trails and backcountry opportunities.

Denali,"This is a spectacularly huge and beautiful park, in any weather. We have been here several times and were happy to be bringing out children this time. We opted for an early morning Park Service bus trip to Eielson for our foray into the park and found the 6-hour length to be just right for us and our teens.We saw an abundance of wildlife (bears, moose, caribou) and breath-taking vistas, although it was hazy from smoke coming in from the Yukon, and Denali herself was never visible.No matter, the wildlife is the most amazing part, and Denali park delivered. We were remarkably pleased by our park service bus trip. It was reasonably priced, and the whole process of booking, checking in, and boarding was very well organized. The buses are upgraded school buses operated by Doyon/Aramark, and they were surprisingly comfortable with ""bucket"" seats and overhead luggage storage. But the most impressive part was our bus driver and guide, Chavez, who really made the trip. He shared an astonishing amount of information about all things to do with the park; as much as we thought we already knew as seasoned visitors, we learned so much from him. He drove extremely well, spotted wildlife expertly, and worked the gaps between buses to be sure we had optimal viewing. We are very grateful to have had him as our guide for the Denali visit.","July 27, 2017","Awesome park, outstanding bus tour to Eielson on the park bus",4,"Oak Ridge, Tennessee",5
Denali,The park is awesome. The dog sled team is a must to watch and pet the dogs. We took the longest bus tour to wonder lake. If you have time in Alaska I would do this but it consumes basicly your whole day. Had a great bus driver. Could probably take a shorter ride and still see some great scenery.

We got to see Mt Denali on a couple of different occasions and were lucky to get some good photos. Only unfortunate thing is were did not get to see a lot of wildlife. We did not get to do the Tundra Wilderness Tour which we really wanted to do but we did take the free shuttle to Savage River which was fun. This was definitely a big check mark on the old bucket list and hope to do it again.,"July 25, 2017",What an incredible place to visit,29,"Satellite Beach, Florida",5
Denali,"This was a 3 day land trip after our Holland cruise. Holland does an excellent job describing and selling their cruises. The 'landtour' program description and instruction desperately neglected in their program and agents instruction. We were not looking forward to this part of the trip.Day one --- traveling from the ship to the park. We departed the ship in Seward so the bus took about 10 hours. We did stop for lunch at a wonderful private restaurant. All the cruise buses were stopping there. It seemed to be closed to other traffic. The meal was a variety of very fresh, off the bone lunch meats & sandwich makings, several salads, great variety of drinks including a bar, excellent bath rooms, and fantastic cookies. No limits on food or refills. Stayed about 1 and 1/2 hours. Delightful and free!The bus was very nice, one bathroom (driver did stop several times), but the drivers narration was not much. This was his first season as very forgivable. He was not as knowledgeable as the next 2 tour host. To our surprise and delight, the 'landtour' turned out to be exceptional. There were several questions we had about meals, tour time frames, facilities, inclusions, choices, disability issues that I never could get good answers to prior to the trip. What info I did get came from wonderful Trip Advisor friends online. We had been told we could buy a land meal package (very expensive and restricted) or fend for ourselves. Being diabetic this was a big concern. Arriving at Denali we were given a packet of info, tour info, the Chalet Village maps,and room keys. No food immediately accessible from our building. The buses inside the Village are nice small tour coaches. They have a very regular schedule of service, drop off points for dining and shopping. Most of our party ate at the steakhouse that night. I've included copies of that menu on Trip Advisor. Cost for dinner about $35-$40 per person. Day two.....Leisurely breakfast or lunch the next morning, we had the afternoon Wilderness tour in Denali. Coffee and pastry or muffin & juice about $15-$20 per person. Dinner that night was pizza since we did not get back from tour until about 9:30 at night. Cost about $15-$20 per person. This was the only real expense on the last tour. Overall I think we spent about $500.00 on food for these 2 days but that was for 9 people and many drank. So that's about $55 or less per person as opposed to the $500 per person which was the general Cody of the food package we were offered. Big difference!Denali Park....A nice snack pack and canned water (all good, plentiful and recyclable) was included on tour; we saw every animal in park, and the bus driver was phenomenal! The day was overcast with a little rain. Perfect for spotting animals especially if you have hunters in your group! The bus driver, Sarah had been doing this tour for 17 years. She was extremely organized and experienced. If someone saw an animal she instructed us to say STOP. She taught us a simple clock system so the guest that spotted the animal could describe where the animal was in proximity to the bus. As we watched from the bus, Sarah pulled a movie camera out and we were able to watch closeup on several in-bus tvs as she honed in on the animal. It is a long tour, 6-8 hours depending on the weather. There were many bathroom breaks.Every time anyone asked a question Sarah would repeat the question over her address system and completely answer. There was no question she could not answer. None! She taught and entertained us for the entire day answering all questions about the history, reproductive, migratory, biology of every single animal. As well as park operation and history. She diplomatically kept us quiet when an animal approached, advised passing bus operators of approaching animals and creatively educated a group that ranged in age from 5 to 85. She have most of us a once in a lifetime experience!Day three...Just when you think nothing can top Denali, you get on the train to Anchorage. Now this train does not travel over 30 mph. It is a double decker train with a glass top! Huge comfortable seating, 8 more hours of top notch education and entertainment. Plus a dining car on the first level of the train. There is a small two occupant elevator of sorts. Very very unique.Attendants on the train provide the narration, entertainment and some food & beverage service during the entire trip! Again, there was not one question the operators could not completely and joyfully answer. These employees truly enjoy what they are doing! The train would slow down or stop to watch animals, mostly moose or show us some unique aspect of living in Alaska. For instance how locals use the train as a shuttle for running everyday errands.Last day of the trip... at the end of the train ride we were bussed from the train to our Anchorage hotel. We left the hotel at 3 am the next day for our flights home. But then Holland slapped us back into reality when Delta airlines would not allow my husband to board with his pre-approved oxygenator!I'm going to find a venue within Trip Advisor to finish these comments under the title of 'traveling with disabilities'. Traveling with disabilities elevates travel to a whole new level of planning. I have concluded that we need to pick our next booking agent very very carefully.","July 25, 2017",Trip of lifetime,4,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

The rangers and other park staff we met were knowledgeable and courteous. We took two bus tours - one was the Kanthishna Experience (12 hours) and the other was a shuttle bus. Very impressed with the knowledge and ability of the staff of the bus company. If Denali isn't on your bucket list, it should be.","July 23, 2017",Wow,31,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5
Denali,"For National Park goers this is one of the tops on most bucket lists with Yellowstone and Yosemite. Maybe I did it wrong, but I was left disappointed. There is limited access to the park, which is controlled by the park service vendor Aramark. Aramark herded us onto old school buses, we had 2 horrible stops, our bus driver talked about his girlfriend instead of Denali, and didn't present the splendor of the park. I wish I would have found a way to sit or hike to enjoy the solitude, beauty and vastness of the park the way it was intended. I overheard good reviews of the Tundra bus tour (higher quality drivers/guides and takes you deeper into the park) and fixed winged planes. Don't do the Natural History Tour. As for wildlife- Given that this is the tundra and the park is so vast (6.2 million acres) we only saw a moose, snowshoe hare, a few squirrels and a few birds. Denali has an estimated 300-350 grizzlies, 200 black bears, 51 wolves, and more than 2,000 moose, caribou, and dall sheep. So, don't expect to see much wildlife. Other parks might give you better odds. Viewing Denali Mountain. Veteran bus drivers in Denali say that only one in three days offers glimpses of the mountain. We didn't see Denali in the park, do to a forrest fire. Be sure to plan your trip the right way and don't just follow your tour group.","July 23, 2017",The hidden facts about Denali.

Denali,"We took the 7 hour transit shuttle ride yesterday from Wilderness Access Center (WAC) to the Eielson Visitor Center. We made a last minute decision to go and were able to make our reservations the night before and pay for them online. Our morning choices were to depart at 6am, 6:30am, or 11:45am and we chose 11:45am-8:45pm. Parking was very hard to find in the late morning! Round trip tickets were $44 each. (We spoke to a couple who took the 13 hour more expensive ""tour"" package and they wish they had taken our shorter, much less expensive trip. They were on the same ""school bus"" type buses as we were, for a longer period of time, but they were served lunch at the end of the road. We were disappointed by the limited visibility due to 3 surrounding fires (so no sight of Denali) but the beauty was still awesome and we saw 12 grizzlies, 6 caribou, a few dall sheep, a grey wolf, a hawk owl, golden eagle and many ptarmigans, mew gulls (similar to seagulls), squirrels, and hares! We took a very small ice chest with frozen water bottles for ice that fit under the bus seat and one small backpack. Due to commitments to keep animals from eating human food, you must consume all food on the bus. Some made their sandwiches on the bus, but the longest break we got was 30 minutes at Eielson Visitor Center, so better to make sandwiches ahead of time. We stopped every 60-90 minutes to stretch our legs, enjoy the views and use bathrooms, which were clean, non-flushing and provided hand-sanitizer. Many stops were 5-10 minutes only. You can hop off and flag down another bus at any time, but they can only pick you up if they have enough room (seat belts). We are glad we did the trip, but decided if we come back again we won't do the bus and just drive into the park as far as cars are allowed and hike around. Or, we will camp in our RV (3 night minimum) as far into the park as we can - I think Mile 33(?) We enjoyed our driver Matt! He was pleasant, good humored, and clear about safety and schedule. He told some interesting stories and was friendly and considerate.","July 23, 2017",A long but rewarding day,12,"Saratoga Springs, Utah",4
Denali,"No doubt this is a beautiful and vast spot overall. But folks need to be aware of some things they may not have thought about. Getting around in the park is very limited and mostly on buses that are a bit better than school buses. They travel on dirt and gravel roads mostly and over several narrow curvy areas (with a gigantic non-survivable drop on one side) without a guardrail in several locations. The weather is extremely unpredictable and quite rapidly changeable (as is common in the mountains). There are a very limited number of private and ranger led hikes. Beyond that, you are free to hike as you wish but keep in mind that there are bears in this wilderness. IF you are not comfortable and proficient at using bear spray, independent hikes are subject to great risk. While confrontations are uncommon, you do not wish to be the exception. Great beauty but not a lot of easy ways to get around in the park.","July 23, 2017",Excellent overall with some caveats,20,"Boston, MA",4

Denali,"Denali is not like any of the other national parks we have visited. Its sheer size and limited accessibility means that its more of a game refuge than a park like Grand Tetons, Yellowstone, Olympic or Acadia. We spent two days there believing that with a park so large we needed the time to see it all.We had terrible weather, cloudy, overcast, drizzle, fog etc so we never got to see the mountain at all. That is not the basis for this review as I understand that the mountain may only be 'out' less than 50% of the time.The park is geared toward riding buses more than hiking or getting out to explore more of the scenery. We took the 12 hour bus tour to Kantishna and we saw some incredible views, a few animals and heard some good stories. We also did a little hiking around the visitors center -- horseshoe lake where we saw a mother moose and its calf. They are not real hiking in the sense of getting out on a long trail but they were nice. Two of our party hiked the Healy trail which is straight up, offered great views, etc. I am glad we came to Denali even if we did not see the mountain. If you think that you are going to want to go to a park and be presented the wildlife and scenery, then this is NOT THE PARK for you. If on the other hand you are in a position to go on longer hikes and adventures, I would suggest skipping the bus rides and taking the park road to mile 15 - Savage River and hiking along those trails. There is nothing out there in terms of support or service, but you will see the park better than the trails around the visitor's center.","July 22, 2017","Amazing when you can see it, weather stunk when we were there",10,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",4

The WAC does not hand out the timings of the shuttles. Either print them at home / hotel or take photographs of the timings pasted at the front desk. After the driver delivered the mandatory safety instructions, we departed the WAC. The driver skipped the campgrounds and reached Talkeetna rest stop. After a brief stop for rest rooms and photos of views, we reached Toklat River stop. The driver imparted some knowledge about the park during the drive. The driver stopped anywhere he or any of the guests saw wildlife. The vehicles in front of us also had stopped at multiple places indicating some wildlife is present. On the way, we saw bear (up close and far off), caribou (far off), and moose (very close quarters). We spent around 30 minutes each at Eielson Visitor Center and Wonder Lake stops. We spent around 15 minutes at the remaining stops. The views of the Alaskan mountain range were incredibly marvelous. We were able to see Mt. McKinley in parts. Once, we saw the bottom half while clouds covered the top half. Another time, the clouds covered the bottom half and the peak was clearly visible. There is no food anywhere in the park past the WAC. Water fountains are available at Eielson Visitor Center. The Wonder Lake has a lot of mosquitoes. It is advisable to apply insect repellent or wear a head net. Rest rooms are available every 90 minutes. The WAC has a theatre that screens a small duration film about the park. There are trails all over the park.

You can also take a free shuttle bus from the visitor center to there. That is wise because not much parking is available at the Savage River site. Beyond here most folks take the park bus. Check online for more information. The 8 hour round trip to Eielson visitor center may give you a view of the Denali mountain but clouds or cover usually obscures views. Only 30% of the time we are told is a view available. But trip worthwhile even with overcast or rain because you will likely see grizzlies, moose, Caribou, Dallas sheep and other wildlife.

Do take a second day shorter trip so you can walk around. Do visit the dog kennels. Do hike the many short trails around the visitor centers. We came across beavers and a moose on the Horseshoe trail. Do pack up meals, snacks & water. Do prepare for any weather. And most of all, don't forget sanitizer hand gels or baby wipes !We saw caribou, trumpet swans, moose & 2 calves, grizzly bears, owls, dall sheep, eagles, hawks, beavers, etc. We were not lucky in spotting a wolf.

Denali,"We would highly recommend making the extra trip to DeNali if you are in Alaska. We got lucky (one of supposedly 30%) who got to see DeNali. We spent 3 full days in the park and were glad we did. The first day we hiked around the Savage River area and thats where we got lucky and saw Denali. We also took the bus trip to Eislson Visitor's Center. Unfortunately we didn't see DeNali up close but did spot mountain sheep, lots of birds, a grizzly bear playing with her 2 cubs, and caribou. It is a long ride and there is no food or water (only water is at eislson visitor's center) so bring everything you need. There is plenty of room on the bus to stash your bags up top. We opted for the cheap and non-narrated bus trip. Our bus driver/tour guide was great and provided significant amounts of information regarding the park and wildlife. He would stop whenever anyone saw wild life or thought they did. We would recommend this trip to see more of Denali than you can on your own. My family agreed that the 12 hour round tip to Wonder Lake would be a little long but it maybe worth it if on a clear day.","July 16, 2017",Incredible!,4,,5

We met many nice and interesting hikers, locals, and tourists. We recommend taking a lunch and plenty of water, and of course your camera. We didn't get off and hike because of our late tour we didn't want to miss a bus coming back in and get stuck out there.

When we started from hotel it was raining and we were afraid we may not be able to enjoy bus ride. But once we moved in park rain stopped nd within one hour it was clear. Unfortunately,  there were clouds over Mount Denali (only 30% time in summer  sky is clear and Mt. is visible) the entire time we were there so we didn't get to see the big mountain (Denali). However, we were lucky to see it from the Alaska Railroad while coming from Anchorage to Denali. We were lucky enough to see the so called Big 3 Bear, Caribou and ship  in park and 4th Moose on the way to hotel . We spotted 6 grizzly bears (enjoyed 2 cubs playing with mother for a long time from very near), 26 caribou ( out of which herd of 13 was largest), hare, 3 ships ( very far off).

Next day we took the bus tour 60 miles into the park and it was even more so. The fact there is one road with mostly the same vehicles made for an unforgettable experience. Our bus stopped frequently to watch herds of Caribou, Dall sheep on the hillsides and an awesome period of watching a mother grizzly and her cub, playing around for nearly 20 minutes. Topped it off with a large moose right off the side of the road that just stood there allowing for pictures.

Denali,"We visited Denali National Park after an Alaskan Cruise. We booked this portion on our own, we calculated the price difference and it made sense. We are experienced travelers and we don't mind doing the research. We are not backpackers, campers, or climbers, we are sightseers.First Denali is a destination, it is a place you want to go and you take the time. The Park lies about 3 hours north of Anchorage and about 2 hours south of Fairbanks. I guess it could be a long day trip but your time in the park would be limited.First the park is massive, the opportunities are virtually endless, climb, hike, run, bike, camp, picnic, fish, raft, kayak, or just pick a spot and relax. Everything is available in the million of acres you can find an activity. The wildlife and scenery is simply stunning.Start with what and what you want to do. Make you plans as early as possible, places to stay fill up,fast and cruises book large chunks of available hotel, resort, and cabin space. We started Six months in advance and we had very little to chose from. Car rentals can get expensive if you book at the last minute as well. We took the 12 hour bus tour offered at Denali and it was full, agin early is better.Our trip met our expectation, we disembarked our cruise ship in Seward took the train to the airport, got our rental car and drove to the Denali area to stay the first night, we then took the early bus tour to the end of the road the next day ( this is a 12-13 hour tour). We then grabbed dinner that night stayed a second night in the Denali area, then headed back to Anchorage the next morning. You might be able to do Denali in one night but I think you would have to take a shorter tour.Weather can be a factor, our day was perfect we had clear skies, with multiple views of the mountain. Our tour allowed us to view moose, caribou, bears, sheep, marmot, birds of all kinds, and a lot more. We did not make the sled dog adventure offered by the park, we did not visit every souvenir shop.

And that's even without seeing the mountain on a clear day :) We took the bus to Eielson and hiked the alpine hike at the visitor's center.

Denali,"We spent four days at Denali National Park. This is a place where the words ""Spectacular"" and ""Magnificent"" and ""Awesome"" seems to roll off your tongue around every turn. The drive up to the Park from Talkeetna is spectacular! Our first stop, once we got to the Park, was the visitor center. We watched the short, beautiful movie about the Park, picked up some information from the Park ranger at the front desk, and checked out the displays downstairs. We would spend the rest of our four days here hiking, taking the shuttle to different points on the only access road into the Park and hiking trails, spending one day on the Kantishna Experience bus tour, seeing the exciting sled dog demonstration, marveling at the wildlife. It was a wonderful adventure everyday. The Kantishna Experience tour was absolutely amazing. This is the only tour that takes you to the end of the only road into the Park (92.5 miles). Our bus driver was Glen - he was great all day with commentary, jokes, information, answering questions. We set off around 7:30 a.m. and hadn't gone two minutes when we saw a mama moose and her two calves on the Park Road 20 feet from us. This would serve as a precursor for the animals we'd see on this trip. After driving to Savage River, the paved road becomes dirt, 2 lanes for a while, then 1 lane for most of the trip. Incredible vistas all along the way: mountains, U and V shaped valleys, thick forests and open tundra, kettle ponds, braided rivers, steep drop-offs, twisty and sharp curves, tight squeezes with other buses, huge panoramas, clouds covering then lifting off the mountains. Any time we saw animals, we were told to holler ""Stop"" and Glen would stop the bus. He had a busy day! We saw many moose, including a mama with 2 calves frolicking in a kettle pond near the road; dozens of Dall sheep, some pretty close to the road and one flock of about 16 about 60 yards away; a huge herd of caribou on the move; two different mama grizzlies each with two cubs = one group was about 150 yards away but the other started about 25 yards away then walked towards us as they grazed, and then they came onto the road and crossed right in front of the bus and continued up the hillside! Awesome!; dozens of snowshoe hares and arctic squirrels; many bald eagles in the air; mew gulls; jaegers and different kinds of ducks. We did not see any wolves, lynx, or wolverines on our trip. We got out of the bus at Wonder Lake and a park ranger joined us for the next couple of hours to talk about the history of mining from here to Kantishna, the hardy people who came here, toiled here, and stayed here. The ranger answered a ton of questions. At the road's end, we took pictures in front of the sign ""End of the Road: 92.5 miles"" and then we toured Fannie Quigley's cabin, one of the people who came and stayed. The ranger was wonderfully informative. On this trip, we received a full snack bag with all kinds of goodies; around lunch time at one of the stops along the way we received a lunch wrap. We stopped at all the rest areas along the way so folks could use the bathrooms or stretch their legs. Several of the stops (Toklat and especially Eielson) were longer stops so we could explore a bit. On this trip, we did not see Denali (Mt. McKinley) itself - it was banked in with clouds. We had the good fortune to see Denali and the Alaskan Range during 3 of our 4 days in Talkeetna. But even without seeing ""the big one"" we had a fabulous day in this incredible, breathtaking National Park.","July 9, 2017",It's hard to find the words to describe this magnificent place!,224,"Bennington, Vermont",5

Saw six grizzly's, one walk next to the bus. 15 total Moose as I camped at Savage River and drove the road a couple times, saw a porcupine, Dalls sheep, caribou and a snowy owl.

We saw grizzly bears, a wolf, Dall sheep, caribou, golden eagle and lots of cheese pizzas (Arctic squirrels).

The views were breathtaking.

One of the reader boards said the the mountain is usually only visible 2 out of 3 days. I've met many people who said they did not get to see the mountain when they were there. We were very fortunate to be able to have seen it so much. Would have liked to see more animals but the park is exceptionally beautiful and peaceful.

We did a lot of hiking, and drove to the 15 mile mark several times. Lots of wildlife, and so beautiful.

We rode in a new bus, which reminded me of a school bus, but was equipped with a mounted monitor with a zoom lens to zoom in on animals idling a distance from the bus. We saw moose, caribou, mountain goats, but the prize was that we saw a female bear and 2 cubs cross the road directly in front of the bus. Lots of beautiful scenery. We rode to mile marker 62...only 30 miles from snow-covered Mt McKinley and had a glorious view....there were no clouds and only blue sky in the background. Quite a memorable day !! One caveat !! For folks who don't like heights, this might not be the tour for them because the bus does climb narrow dirt roads on the sides of hills with no guard rails.","July 1, 2017",Memorable trip !!,40,,5
Denali,"Beautiful National Park! You have to take a bus tour to go further into the park than the 15 miles cars are allowed to drive in. We took the non narrated (green bus) to Eielson Visitor Center (mile 66). It is an 8 hour tour and makes for a long day! We did see moose, caribou, sheep, and bears from the bus. They are usually far away so take good binoculars or a camera with a good zoom. The buses will stop for wildlife and scenery shots along with designated rest stops. We had several views of Denali and were able to see it with minimal cloud cover. The scenery on the bus ride is beautiful. You can get off the bus at anytime to hike (don't expect marked trails) and hop on another bus to continue your journey.

Denali,"This is going to be a long review! We were in Denali for 2 days as part of our HAL land tour. 30% er's for 2 days in a row. We saw the mountain as we drove up to the park on our first day there. After settling in at the hotel we took a shuttle bus into the park and just as we round the corner into the park there's the first moose sighting, right at the side of the road. We made our usual first stop at the visitor's center to get the National Parks Passport book stamps and pickup a map of the trails. We decided to take the hike down the McKinley Station trail and saw a baby moose hiding in the brush. We hiked to the railroad tressel over the Riley Creek and then decided to turn back as it was getting late. On our second day in the park we were on the 8-9 hour Tundra Tour that takes you well into the park. Our driver/guide was Joe and he was very informative and good at spotting the animals. The Tundra Tour is the only way to see the park and ours was included with our package so we had the 8 AM tour, if you're not with a cruise tour make sure you make your reservations early they sell out quickly. So for a second day we can see Mt. Denali clearly as we head into the park. Along the way we will see Dall Sheep, Caribou, Snowshoe Hare, Moose ( and Squirrel ), Mama Grizzly and 2 cubs, a Gray Wolf , and a Fox. I know some reviews here complain that they saw no or very few animals, well folks that's nature we just got real lucky to see them all. I would say do the tour if you have the time, you never know what's around the next corner.","June 29, 2017",One of the best National Parks!,115,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

Denali,"This trips was a 15 day (4 days on ship-11 day land journey) through the inside passage, Juneau, Skagway via ship then Skagway to the Yukon via rail and motor coach. From Skagway to White Horse, Canada, Dawson City, Canada. Then to Fairbanks via air. Motor coach to Danali National Park and then the dome train trip from Denali to Anchorage, AKWhile the sea portion of the trip was good the land package was outstanding. We had a journey host that was with us for the full 11 day land part of the package. We were briefed many times as the trip progressed about upcoming hotel stay, eating options, sightseeing options etc. Each morning we would put our bags outside our hotel door and they would be picked up and in our hotel room at the next location before we even arrived. Additionally we did not have to wait till the usual 3 PM to get into our rooms. Twice we had our bags in our rooms at 10 AM that morning allowing us to do some sightseeing and not worrying about when our bags would arrive. Traveling through the Yukon and especially Dawson City was fantastic with all the gold rush history. You can pan for gold in a creek bed, take a train trip through the mountains, helicoptor tours and just about everything. The helo and plane tours are pretty expensive so we passed on those. We learned just how much we don't know about Alaska. Juneau the capital is only accessed via boat or air. No roads or rail go into our out of Juneau. There are more sea float planes by a 10-2 margin in Alaska than anywhere else in the world. We saw tons of them landing and taking off on lakes and inlets almost every day. Danali National Park was the icing on the cake. equal to Yellowstone in the spring with all the many animals. Grizzly bears, foxes, bald eagles etc. We saw a pack of wolves munching on a moose carcass. We saw many moose out and about and some came within 10 feet of us when we were on a wagon pulled by a couple horses for a cookout trip. Put this on your bucket list as it was a fantastic trip. The Gold Dredge mining tour was outstanding. Not to pricey and they did not try to hose you at the shops. Free coffee, hot choc, and warm cookies were provided which was a nice touch. Bottles of water were 50 cents. Second tour you must take is the Husky Homestead tour at Denali is a must. Jeff King runs the place which raises husky puppies for future dog sled teams. He has run the Iditarod like 26 strait years winning 3 and finishing in the top 10 over 11 times. You get off the bus and the first thing you get handed is a husky puppy to hold and take pictures. You can get an autographed picture with a puppy. Nice photo a reasonable $15. You can take your own photo's with pups too. All in all this was a very professional run tour with Mitch Henderson the cruise coordinator for Holland that set things up and was great. Billy Hyde was our journey host and also top notch.","June 28, 2017",Holland American sea/land cruise,4,,5

We also saw grizzly bears with cubs, caribou, Dall sheep, moose and golden eagles. The ride, in addition to being spectacular, is somewhat unnerving because a good part of the road is narrow, gravel, is cut into a steep hillside and has no guardrails. It's exciting when you encounter oncoming traffic! Although the buses look like conventional old style school buses, they're modern, comfortably equipped and they have a video system that allows the driver to video distant objects (animals) and project them onto the monitors throughout the bus.

Denali,"We camped at Teklanika campground at mile 29 in the park. It was nice to be away from the craziness of the front of the park. We took a bus ride all the way to Kantishna at mile 92. We saw many caribou, bears, a horry marmot, some birds and some dahl sheep far off in the distance. Our driver had a very dry sense of humor and it was really funny to listen to him navigate us through the park. We made a few stops along the way and had amazing vistas. We even got a glimpse of Denali although the top was obscured by clouds. All in all it took us about 10 hours round trip from our campground. The others on the bus had an extra 2 hours of the first 29 miles into the park.I was a little disappointed at the end of the road as there was a small cabin that was locked and bathrooms. That was all there was to see. There is a town there but we didn't get to see that.

Denali,"What can be said about one of the last great wilderness areas in the United States! We went to Denali as part of our cruise and Land Tour with Holland America. The area is beautiful! You are exposed to forests, tundra, mountains, snow, rivers and lakes. You can enjoy senior and handicap friendly tours as well as rafting, ATV, hiking trips. We did our scheduled Tundra Wilderness Tour and were lucky enough to see the Big 4....moose, caribou, bears and cubs and Dall Sheep. We had a very knowledgeable guide / bus driver and even though we were all on the look out for animals, she was the one who spotted the bear off in the distance. What was great about this tour was the fact that the bus was equipped with a zoom lense video camera that she would train on the animals who were off up a hill and then this would be projected onto screens in the bus. So even though the mamma bear and cubs was frolicking far away, we got to enjoy their antics close up. The downside is the tour is 7 to 8 hours long and there are bathroom stops, but be prepared for the port a potty type toilet and only hand sanitizer as there is no running water. You are also on a relatively comfortable school type bus, which once you see the road traveled and your driver explains things makes perfect sense. The tour provided a snack box with a few different choices, bottled water and the drivers recycle all plastic, cans and cardboard at the end of the trip. It was suggested to us to order the box lunch the night before at the Starbucks in the resort lobby for am pick up. There are only 2 choices and the sandwich selection which our group bought was, for lack of a better word, gross! So bring some of your own extra snacks or there is a Subway sandwich shop across the way where, if you are ambitious enough, you can go right before your tour and get something fresher and more appetizing than what we wasted our money on. Denali is a must see if you make a trip to Alaska. If it's in your budget, I totally endorse adding the land package to an Inner Passage Cruise no matter which cruise line you are on.","June 23, 2017",Must See,24,,5

Denali, First of all if your going to take the bus ride up in the park - go to the visitor center and buy your tickets only about $35.00 - we checked online and they wanted $150 + for other bus companies that take advantage of the travelers so beware ! Buses leave every 1/2 hour starting in the morning till about 2:00 -  Bus ride is about 8-9 hours long - take a good camera - binoculars- comfy sitting clothing - water - food to eat - there's nothing once you leave on the bus !

Denali,"Our visit was in early June, and there was still a fair amount of snow on the ground at the passes. The temperature was in the 60's, so it was quite comfortable. We saw moose, grizzlies, caribou, long horned sheep and a variety of other minor animals and birds. Because the park totally prohibits private vehicles beyond a 7 mile barrier, it is very pristine and with the exception of the single gravel road it is largely untouched by man. There are a few brave hikers and campers on foot, but otherwise the only park traffic is on the US Park Service buses running their tour routes.The only disappointment for us -- and actually very typical of 70% of the visitors -- was that we could not see the mountain itself. It was totally clouded over.Denali is not particularly scenic. Much of it is high meadow, withsparse vegetation and no trees. And, lots of the river basin lowlands are vast washes that handle large summer melt run-offs, and sit barren and idle for the balance of the year. The allure of the park is in its animal life.

Our trip was in May, so the weather can be capricious; the park was closed the day after we were there due to 6-11 inches of snow. While the flowers were not in full bloom yet, we saw a lot of wildlife--a cow moose with her calf, a Grizzly with a spring cub, Snowshoe Hare, herd of Caribou, Dall sheep, porcupine, a pair of Willow Ptarmigan, a Golden Eagle, and amazingly, a pair of Gray Wolves, crossing the road in front of us. It is a beautiful and majestic natural resource with wildlife that cannot be seen many other places in our country.","June 16, 2017","Toklat Tundra Wilderness Tour, Denali NP and Preserve",54,,5

Took one of the bus tours that left the wilderness access centre, which we found enjoyable and informative. Not exactly teeming with wildlife unless you count bear sightings from about 3 miles away which were not visible without binoculars!!

Potty and food stops were appropriate and Visitor Center and other stops very scenic and helpful. Guide and bus driver very helpful and knowledgeable. This would be 5 stars except for the narrow, unpaved road, with no safety barriers when close to a cliff or drop off. We had seat belts but they probably would not have helped much with the heights. We were fearful and I doubt we will do this again. The Park should rectify this safety problem before someone is injured or worse. ","June 15, 2017",Kantishna Wilderness Trails Tour,0,,3

There was great hiking, and wonderful facilities. I went to the sled dog demo which was ok, but not excellent. The 13-hour bus trip down the park road was well worth the time. This park is well maintained and provides a bit of something for everyone. The only complaint is that the bus system is confusing, and the buses don't run frequently enough.

It is the only way to get in - unless you have a scheduled travel and camping plan with the park and even then - you cannot pass a certain point with a car. The tour guide was informative and the stops along the way provided a detailed history of the park and the people. The American Native Woman who gave a speech at one of the stops) the stop with the outhouses - was interesting, but a bit too dramatic for me. While the day was clear for the most part and it was in mid May is was cold cold so bundle up. Once the wind hits you it is harsh. The actual station with exhibits was also detailed with interactive areas that a child may enjoy. It was small however.","June 14, 2017",Interesting Tour The only way to get into the Park,55,Deland,5

Even though the day was drizzly it made a better trip since the animals were out and the dust on the road was minimal. The mountains and glaciers were just beautiful. No other place like it. .

Denali,"Denali National Park is one of those unique places, truly a natural wonder that leaves you with a sense of gratitude for having been able to experience part of it. I was awed by the vast, wildness and rugged beauty of this incredible place on planet earth. The wildlife was amazing, the mountains were beautiful and mysterious disappearing and reappearing behind majestic clouds, the eagles soaring and grizzlys foraging, caribou, moose, little gophers and ptarmigans all added to it's singular wonder.The rivers and rivulets and ponds and waterfalls here and there. It is so different from my normal life. And the amount of oxygen in the air from all the trees and vast forests I believe was renewing and invigorating and helped me think more clearly. I wish I could have taken a canister of Denali air home with me! It was a wonderful experience getting to see part of it and I hope to return. Read all you can about Denali before you go and make plans for your time so you can maximize your experience. Mine was breathtaking! We took the all day tour which takes you into the park as far as you are allowed to go on the paved roads to the visitor center. We had a driver who provided commentary and stopped for wildlife viewing and photo ops. The ride was on a very narrow gravelly road that was a white knuckle ride at times with a shear drop over the edge of the mountain. All in all I felt blessed by the experienced and hoped to be fortunate enough to return!","June 9, 2017",Awesome,51,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

We took an 8 hour bus ride 62 miles into the park and saw some of the most stunning vistas in America. We also got an up-close and personal look at Denali, the highest peak in North America. Thankfully the weather was outstanding and we got some beautiful photos of the mountain and surrounding landscape. We also saw herds of caribou, dall sheep, moose, and 3 grizzlies. Needless to say, this was perhaps the highlight of our trip. Go see the Alaskan coast but also take an excursion into the interior and visit Denali.

Denali,"Husky demonstration is held two or three times a day, but be sure to get the current times, because the published times of the demo were not accurate early in the season. Husky demonstration is free and allows plenty of time to pet dogs and watch a short demonstration of watching the dogs pull a sled on wheels. Park has several areas where commemorative ink stamps are available. There is also a museum and a Junior Ranger Park program which is designed for kids, but adults are welcome to participate as well, and come with an activity booklet, and Junior Ranger Badge, if the booklet is completed.The park is adjacent to the Alaska Railroad depot. Shuttle buses from some local hotels serve the park near the Visitors Center. Free shuttle buses also go to the Husky demonstration as well as to Riley Creek (which we did not see) and Savage River, from which a stop allows you to see Mount Denali (from a very great distance if the clouds don't obscure your view), The local park rangers are very helpful. Horseshoe Lake was recommended to us from several others and was the hiking trail that we chose. It was indisputably beautiful, but in my opinion, a moderately strenuous hike with at least one long incline (which you will take going back, even it's not a problem going out). Wild animals roam the park freely, and we saw moose crossing the road from the shuttle bus and moose in the parking lot more than once. So be sure that you are previously instructed on what to do in case of encountering wild animals, as they are not to be approached.","June 8, 2017",Lots to see for free,164,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

Denali,"Like Jenny Lake in WY, there are no words to describe Denali. It's truly a transcendental experience to hike amongst the wilderness, view the landscapes and absorb everything that makes this park truly visit-worthy. There are two types of buses: shuttle buses and tours. The former will drive you into the park and then you're free to explore once you reach yr destination. Most of the drivers will give you general insight on the area. Note that certain places are only open during certain times. Sites like Wonder Lake don't open until Jun 1. I went Memorial Day weekend so I could only go as far as Toklat River. Cost was $26.50 RT + $10 park entrance fee (park fee is good for 7 days). The shuttle cost increases the farther you go out. Pack more food than you need and bring water. Only restrooms are available once you leave the Wilderness Access Center (WAC). The bus ride from the WAC to Toklat was about 2.5 hours. You'll make a few rest stops in between. You can take a different shuttle bus on the way back so be sure to take a photo of the outbound bus schedule. You're encouraged to explore off the main road, but remember the advice given if you run into bears or moose. Once we arrived at Toklat, I left the main road and wandered into the dry river bed. It's so vast it's practically impossible to see every square feet. The park is open 24 hrs and thanks to the solstice, the sun doesn't set until very late. Later in the evening, around 9 pm, Id return to the park w/ my takeout, park the car facing the mountains and just sit and eat in silence. We saw many animals during the bus ride including bears, sheep and caribou. Bring binoculars and a camera w/ high zoom capabilities. If you have any inclination to visit, start packing.

Denali,"My wife and I saw this majestic mountain a number of times during our escorted 'Natural Wonders of Alaska' tour with Titan Tours in May 2016. We were unfortunate that the mountain was covered by cloud on the days we could see the mountain thus missing out on seeing it's peak in all it's glory. We saw it's lower slopes as well as the snow and ice covering it's higher slopes during our tour of Denali National Park and Preserve whilst staying 2 nights on a room only basis at the Grande Denali Lodge Hotel. We took an optional day tour on one of the park buses along the Park Road. We travelled about 53 miles into the park reaching the Toklat River where we turned around for our return journey to the Denali Park and Preserve Visitor's Centre. Tom, our very knowledgeable and experienced Park Ranger and bus driver, explained that Denali at 20,310 feet (6,190 meters) above sea level is the tallest mountain in North America and the summit is covered in snow and ice throughout the year (I had to take his word for it!). It is also apparently the third highest summit of the Seven Summits, the highest summits on each of the seven continents, with Everest in Nepal and Aconcagua in Argentina being first and second respectively. Tom also explained the controversy regarding naming the mountain Denali. It was named Mount McKinley in 1896, after President William McKinley, by a gold prospector named William Dickey. The mountain however is called Denali by the native Koyukon Athabascan people, usually translated as ""The Great One"". This became it's name officially in August 2015, with President Barack Obama's approval, when the U.S. Department of the Interior officially renamed the mountain Denali. It was a shame I didn't have an opportunity to see the summit during my tour of Alaska. I was fortunate however to see some wonderful photographs of the mountain and it's summit on display inside McKinley View Lodge, appreciating it's size, height and beauty.","May 15, 2017",Majestic mountain - hope to see the summit next time!,1223,"Llanbedr, United Kingdom",5

McKinley, it made no sense.

Denali,"Denali NP is an all day activity. You can only drive up to the 15 mile mark before having to turn back to the visitors center. The only way to explore the park properly is to go to the visitors center and puchase a bus ticket. They have various bus routes that will take you to different points throughout the park. If you are travelling in summer make sure to book your bus tickets at least 3-4 days in advance especially if you want to do the full 92 mile trip to Wonderlake & Kantishna. We just did the 8 hour return trip to the Eilson Center. The buses are a little frustrating as we saw some bears and our driver stoped for about 2 minutes and then took off again. You can'tjust stop and enjoy the wildife which is a bit annoying. We saw 5 bears including a mama and her 2 cubs.We also saw Moose, Caribou and Dall Sheep.

Denali,"The highlight of our Denali trip was a ranger led hike. We signed up for the strenuous hike at mile 56 (they have 2 hikes a day - one within 30 miles of the park entrance and one further into the park). It was the best $35 pp we spent in Alaska. The discovery hikes get their own bus into the park so they can get you out to your hike faster, which also meant we all got great seats on the bus (the other bus lines had fairly long lines). The seat behind the driver has the best views going into the park and then the opposite side on the way back. Even though the discovery bus doesn't stop as often or as long as the regular ones, we did stop several times (to see wildlife, at Polychrome pass and to see Denali). Ranger Pete did a great job assessing what types of things the group wanted to do on the hike and how fast to go. We learned a lot about Denali and had an awesome ~4 hour hike. On our other days in Denali, we did the Horseshoe Trail (which was an easy hike near the park entrance) and the Mt Healy Overlook Trail (which was also near the park entrance but a steep incline but well worth the views at the top). We personally did not want to spend 2 days on the long bus rides into the park, so I'd recommend one day going far into the park (either to Eielson or doing the further in ranger led hike) and one day closer in (either to Savage River area or doing the closer ranger led hike).","November 7, 2016",Must Do in Alaska,27,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

While there are longer trips available, this eight-hour trip is sufficient to appreciate the vastness of this incredible park. With luck, you might see Denali mountain, though it's more often covered by clouds than not. You will see wildlife -- we saw two huge grizzlies up close, caribou at a distance and two young bull moose who were ""testing"" themselves in a sparring match. This was fun to see, though not yet quite a ""Wild Kingdom"" event as it was early in the season when bull moose start to assert themselves for territory and mating. The trip included two or three stops for vistas, which were breathtaking.Tip: If you're taking an afternoon tour, sit on the left side of the bus for the best views. On the return trip, your views will be less good, but you will earlier have had the best daylight for seeing things and taking pictures.

The shuttle buses are a fantastic way to see some of the park, the wildlife and meet other people. We saw a moose and her calf within 10 minutes of getting on a shuttle bus! Wow. We did the Savage River Shuttle and we hiked a couple of trails (short ones). Trails are easy to follow and there are generally other people not too far in front or behind you. We saw wildlife! The Visitor Centre is a great base to start from - the rangers are very helpful and very friendly. There is a lovely cafe with all sorts of foods and drinks either to eat in or take away. Toilet facilities are located at most of the drop off stations for the shuttles. There are numerous activities to get into during your stay - however I would research which trails or activities you would like to do and take note of end of season activities (we found a lot of things closed,including shops and eateries as it was end of season). Recommend doing the trail from the Visitor Centre Car Park - easy to moderate intensity and this trail leads up to a fantastic view overlooking the surrounding mountains and you can see the trees and hotels below.

Denali,"We have just returned from an Alaskan vacation including a Denali Explorer Cruise Tour; booking number vmdcx5j.   We will not be doing that again.  The land portion of the tour was not a good experience.  It was poorly thought out; poorly organized and featured both uncomfortable and inconvenient lodging and bad restaurants.  Moreover Princess representatives lied about the land portion throughout the cruise tour. Also the Princess website is a disaster: it is very poorly organized and it is outrageous to make a website that complex without including a search feature  We will probably try to avoid Princess in future.We sailed from Vancouver Sept 3 on the Coral Princess and the cruise portion of the trip was fine except for a lack of hot water in our shower (D416) the last several days of the voyage, a problem that was never which addressed. We had sailed with Princess twice before and therefore the cruise and ship was much as we expected.  The room was comfortable and the food good.Before the cruise we reserved excursions for both the cruise ports and land portion of the trip.  Before sailing I suffered a hip injury which led us to want to cancel a hike we had scheduled for the land portion.  On ship we went to the excursion desk to cancel the hike and were told that they had nothing to do with excursions during the land portion and that we should talk to the excursion desk at our land hotel.  When we arrived at the McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge we went to the excursion desk and tried to cancel the excursion, they told us that it was too late to change any excursions.  They did give us a refund for my portion but refused to refund my husband’s portion of the price. Princess personnel on the ship should have (and probably did) know the rules about the excursions on the land tour. We met a woman who had waited until she was aboard the ship to worry about excursions for the land portion only to be told that it was too late to book anything. This is very different from the shore excursions which can apparently be booked at the last minute.  Why should there be a difference? And since there is, why is it not made clear both by the website and Princess personnel?  There seems to be a pattern of hiding details about the land portion of the tour, perhaps to conceal its deficiencies until the client has booked and it is too late.A major problem with the land tour was that it was labeled Denali Explorer and yet was structured in such a way as to prevent us from seeing Denali National Park.  We spent 2 nights at the McKinley Princess Wilderness Lodge in Talkeetna which is located in Denali State Park and did not offer much in the way of opportunities to see wildlife, nor does it have the diversity of habitats that the national park features. We spent one night at Denali Princess Lodge but were outraged to learn that the tour of the park scheduled for everyone was a watered-down 3 hr tour wasting valuable time in the early morning hours with presentations, After the tour there were two hours before we left for Fairbanks and that 2-hour drive involved a useless 30 min stop at a gift shop.  There should have been time for a better wildlife tour; at least for those who wanted it.   Again the details of the schedule were not made clear before booking.In addition to the poor itinerary, the land portion of the tour featured consistent lying by Princess personnel, uncomfortable accommodations and poor restaurant offerings.  As an example of the lying; while on ship we were given luggage tags for bags to accompany us on the land tour and bags to be forwarded directly to Fairbanks.  We were given only two tags for accompanying bags and  4 tags for Fairbanks.  When we requested more tags for accompanying bags we were eventually given them but told that the rooms on the land portion were very small and that there would be no room for more than one bag each.  This proved to be completely false.  The rooms at all three lodges on the land portion were as large or larger than our mini-suite on the  ship.  Furthermore, while on ship we were told that our hand carry baggage for the land portion could not include wheeled carry-on bags but only soft-sided totes or backpacks.  Telling us what luggage we would need on land while we were in mid-ocean was irritating enough but this information also turned out to be completely false.  Wheeled carry-on bags brought by many passengers were easily accommodated underneath the buses and stowed away by train personnel.  All of these luggage issues were  flagrant attempts to mislead passengers into doing what Princess felt would be most convenient for Princess.In addition, while approaching both the McKinley and Denali lodges we were told by our driver that we would be taken to our rooms by shuttle and that shuttles would be available to take us around the facility.  This was false in both cases.  At both places the shuttle route moved around the periphery of the property with stops that included neither shelter nor benches.  The rooms were usually uphill and accessible only by stairs. With my hip injury this was inconvenient and frustrating for me, particularly encumbered by hand luggage, and many of the participants in the tour were much older and/or more handicapped than I am.  Many people using canes and walkers were left to struggle on the paths of the lodges in the rain getting no  help from Princess.  This is unconscionable!  One woman arrived at by train at Denali Princess in a mobility scooter and was left sitting in the rain because the buses to the housing could not accommodate her scooter.  She had made arrangements months earlier when she booked, but upon arrival Princess personnel merely shrugged and referred the matter to a supervisor by radio.  At the lodges Princess customer service consisted of being handed an envelope with a schedule and keys and nothing else.  As we arrived, late, at Denali Princess we asked about an excursion we had booked for that afternoon and were told that it would be no problem.  Upon arriving at the lodge main lobby there was sign of Princess and we were left to get in touch with the excursion company and sort things out on our own.  We booked our excursions through Princess  expecting Princess to take some responsibility for them but that was not the case.At both the McKinley and Denali Princess Wilderness lodges the restaurants featured mediocre food and slipshod service.  The”fine dining” restaurant at each was a joke; neither the menu, the decor nor the service were different from the other places.  The wait staff at both places was a bunch of nice, well-meaning, but clueless and untrained kids, and we were there at the end of the season.  When we declined dessert at one restaurant, the waiter said “ Great!”.  In all our years of restaurant dining that was a first.  Again, upon returning from Talkeetna one evening we asked the driver of the Princess bus which restaurants would be open; he stated that the “fine dining” option was open until 10 pm.  Arriving there at 9:30 pm we were told that the restaurant closed at 9 pm.  Once again Princess personnel gave misinformation.My husband summarized the situation by saying that the sea and land portions of Princess seemed to be two separate companies that hated each other.  They also seem to have no concern for the comfort, convenience or quality of experience of their customers","September 29, 2016",Avoid Princess Denali Explorer,67,"Half Moon Bay, California",5

Denali,My daughter won the road lottery. We were allowed to drive our car the full length of the road. It was an overcast day so we only saw glimpses of Denali. We did see plenty of wildlife. The road from mile 30 to Wonder Lake was absolutely amazing. Normally you are allowed to drive your car to mile 15 or to mile 30 during the shoulder season (weather permitting). I strongly recommend taking a shuttle bus to at least Eielson Visitor Center. I enjoyed being able to stop and explore when we wanted. I understand that doing that in the summer is difficult as the shuttle buses are often full and getting a seat once you get off is hit or miss. There are plenty of things to do at Eielson. You can spend plenty of time there and catch the bus back.

Denali,"The best views of Denali are actually from the road to Takeetna, about an hour and a half from the little town of Denali near the park entrance. We were lucky enough to get those on a clear day. Unless you are a very serious outdoors person there are limited things to see and do in the park itself. We have been to almost every National Park in the Western US, and many of the ones east of the Rockies. All of the Denali area is set up for one of two types of tourists. It primarily caters to the tour groups, in the time we spent we saw close to a hundred Princess Cruise line buses. On the other extreme there are the ""into the wild"" types, while we were there they found one and recovered the bodies of several. If you go, skip Fairbanks, take the train from Anchorage. Enjoy the little town of Takeetna and hope you get a view of the mountain, it is spectacular on a clear day. Go to the Princess Lodge and walk around the grounds, have lunch, and allow yourself about an hour for the visitor center just inside the park entrance.

Denali,"Scenery was OK - the ""blurb"" we received stated that Denali was one of the most picturesque park in the US. Definitely not at this time of the year.It was partly Boreal Forest and partly Sub-Arctic Desert – a lot of fairly barren country with stunted spruce trees struggling to survive in the poor subsoil. Even though the trees look small, many of them are 150 years old – there is not enough nourishment for them to grow tall. Monty told us that each inch of trunk depth represents around 15 years.Most of the trees had lost their leaves – it is the end of the season and from tomorrow the park is closed to all vehicles – today was the last open day. From then on only cross-country skiers and dog teams can enter the park. In fact the Denali National Park actually “employs” huskies for the winter season.Our first stop was at the Wilderness Access Centre to watch a short film called “Across Time and Tundra” – photos and movies from the very early days of the park – it was quite interesting, but rather spoilt by stretching it to fill the wide screen.The tour was listed as approximately 6 hours, in the fine print: park tour is approximately 5 hours - not sure where that extra hour would have been with the short distance between the Lodge and the park entrance. And anyway we were only away for 4 hours – not 5; not 6. ","September 22, 2016",Boring and barren late September - did a bus tour from lodge,38,Sydney,3

The wildlife was relatively sparse (only 3 bears, a couple of moose, a couple of caribou and a golden eagle were spotted), but it was late September. The road was in excellent condition and the views were spectacular. We did get a obstructed glimpse at Denali's peaks.

Denali,"We took a 7 hour tour on a bus into Denali. Polychrome was absolutely beautiful. We saw dall sheep (way up on the mountain tops), caribou (quite a few), and bears. I will say that I was a little disappointed in not seeing more wildlife, like moose, but what we did see, was awesome. The tour bus did stop along the way, but next time, we want to take the shuttle bus, that way we can get out and hike around instead of just getting out to stretch here and there. The views were breathtaking! Didn't get to see the top of Mt. Denali though, as it was covered in clouds. Others that went a day or two later did get to see it though. So I think next time, we'll plan to stay at one of the lodges that are actually inside Denali National Park, and stay for a couple of days. All in all, it was a great tour, and will definitely be back again.","September 21, 2016",Need to go back!,23,"Tampa, Florida",4

Anyway, in 3 days I didn't see a moose nor a bear... No eagles either. Just some sheep way way up a mountain top. I also had the pleasure to encounter a terribly rude information ""person"" when I stopped to ask information at the Wilderness Access Center. There were no place left on the shuttles.

You can choose to alight at various stops along the way if you want to explore further but we were recommended by the staff to stay on the bus. Along the way our bus driver Scott entertained us with stories of the national park and its history. There were rest stops along the way and you need to bring your own food and drinks. We were lucky to have seen the caribou, moose and grizzly bears. The whole trip lasts about 6hours which is one of the shortest tours. There are many other tours available to choose from. Overall a productive trip provided if there is good weather and if the animals are more active which does need some luck.","September 20, 2016",Awesome experience! ,5,,5

We had scheduled a 9:00 departure but actually made it there before 8:00....we asked Stephen if he had room on his 8:00 departure and he so kindly honored our request.

Denali,"I've been to Denali National Park three times. It is so beautiful and unspoiled. The park's landscape changes dramatically between mountains, wetlands, valleys, streams and rivers. There is so much beauty all around you that you can't take it all in in one day. The first time I went, I took a ""Tundra Wilderness Tour"" for $160 (the beige colored buses). This tour stopped at several locations, but I found myself wanting to stop and get off the bus more frequently. The second time I went, I took the Denali Park Shuttle ($55) - the green buses. You can get on and off of these buses anytime you want to and they run about every 15 minutes. The third time I went (Sept. 3, 2016), I drove into Denali in my rental car because you can drive to Mile 15 Savage River. I parked there and got out and walked down to Savage River and walked along the river for awhile. I decided not to take a tour or shuttle bus deeper into the park because I had been there twice and the tours/buses take a long time. If you travel the 90 mile length of the Denali Park Road and back, it will take you 12 hours! Yes, 12 hours, but it is a beautiful drive if the weather is good. If the weather is bad, you are stuck on a bus for 12 hours. Luckily, there are restroom stops. Pack a lunch, snacks and drinks for this tour and allow all day.","September 18, 2016",I love Denali National Park!,76,North Carolina,5
Denali,"A visit to Denali is so weather dependent. The weather was cloudy, misty and foggy throughout our three days in Denali. There was never a hope of getting a glimpse of Mt. Denali so we were very disappointed in that regard. The fog obscured even the closer ridges so never got any good photos. Good thing we had binoculars with so that we could see wildlife in the distance. Nothing up close so disappointed in that regard as well.

Denali,"Denali is an opportunity to experience a six million acre park of true wilderness and experience life above the tree line, tundra, and boreal forests. You will also see animals in their natural setting. We took the Tundra Wilderness Tour, which is a six to eight hour bus ride about 60 miles into the park. (The full park road is about 80 miles long.) You will ride in a school bus, so the ride is not luxurious, but it's not terrible. Our bus even had a telephoto camera which projected an view on screens throughout the bus. If you are lucky, you will see moose, grizzly bear, dahl sheep, wolves, and caribou. We saw all but wolves. Realize, however, that most of these sightings were of animals at a significant distance from the road. Binoculars or a long, telephoto lens are a must. It's a beautiful ride in good weather--which we had. There are rest areas along the way, and a basic box lunch was provided. Unless you have your own vehicle, this is the only way to see the park.","September 16, 2016","If you love nature and wild palces, just being here is worth it",4,"Pisgah Forest, North Carolina",4
Denali,"My wife and I spent 3 days here during our Alaska trip. Being avid hikers we wanted to make sure we got to hike their best trails which there aren't a lot of and the ones they do have are close to the visitor center. Most hikers plot their own course across the wilderness which honestly we just didn't feel comfortable doing this trip, maybe the next one. The trails that we did hike were decent, challenging and quite scenic. You do have to keep an eye out for wildlife on the trails. The first two that we hiked, Savage River and Alpine Trails, had multiple grizzly attacks a month or so prior. We kept our heads on a swivel in the brushy areas and made sure to make lots of noise. While hiking on the Triple Lakes Trail there was a grizzly blocking our way at the Hines Creek Bridge so we waited a while for it to leave and eventually turned around. On our last day there we enjoyed a park ranger guided hike with a dog sled demonstration. None of the trails or the main road even get you close to the real Denali which is where the spectacular mountains and glaciers are. To do that we tried three different times to take a scenic flight that was cancelled each time due to poor weather conditions. We ended up taking a 6 hour bus ride through the park to the Toklat River Stop. We wished we would have had time to go further since the scenery and amount of wildlife only got better and better but this was a last minute decision and time got away from us. The weather, as previously mentioned, was challenging. Cloudy, windy and sometimes rainy but we pushed on and made the most of our time there. We got to see a brief appearance of the west half of Mt. McKinley's peak through the clouds and from a distance but only for a few minutes then it was gone never to be seen again the rest of our trip. We weren't even able to see anything from the highway's scenic pullovers while driving to and from Denali, just a shroud of clouds. We did get to see moose, grizzly (from a safe distance, haha), caribou and other wildlife while we were there which we were hoping for. We have mixed feelings about our visit - glad to see and do what we did and also disappointed that we didn't get to see and do more, but I guess that's just life and that's just Denali.","September 16, 2016",One of the More Challenging National Parks to Enjoy,393,"Denver, Colorado",4

Denali,"Having just spent a month at Banff, Lake Louise and Jasper, before coming here, Denali is pathetic. Don't stay at the Tek campground. There are no trails. The only hiking is on the gravel/dirt Park Road, and every time one of the tour buses or National Park Service vehicles comes by you get to breathe a thick cloud of dust for a couple minutes. You're not allowed to drive your car unless you leave. The Riley Creek campground has trains and highway noise, including trucks using their enginge brakes. In 2 weeks at Denali I saw one female moose and a calf. I saw more moose, bears, elk, foxes and goats in the Canadian parks and the Alaska Highway. The Tek campground at Denali has outhouses with cold water a few spigots outside. The Canadian National Park campground rest rooms are heated, have hot and cold water, flush toilets and showers, and cost less (not even taking into account the exchange rate). The National Park Service runs parks for its own benefit, not visitors. They make it virtually impossible to use the park with all the rules and restrictions. You can see natural history exhibits with plastic animals as they have at their visitor centor at any metro natural history museum. It was especially comical to see them urging people to not kill mosquitoes, the cause of so many diseases! The rangers even give taks about how wonderful mosquitoes are. Incredible. The facilities are a national embarrassment. It's full employment for rangers who do next to nothing.","September 15, 2016",nothing to do,8,Milford,1

Do take the bus trip at least as far as Eielson Visitor's Center as that's the first place you can see Denali if it's out.

Denali,"The Denali visitor Center was very accessible, we had no lines to get lunch when we were there, around 11:30AM but outrageously expensive, as is most of Alaska. Upon entering the park, there were two moose calves and their mom right on the railroad tracks! It is a 6 hour bus ride on uncomfortable school buses on a very dusty road, so windows had to stay closed or you couldn't breath, and it was very warm when we were there. We stopped regularly for animal sightings and bus drivers are very accommodating to allow views and photos. We were not allowed outside of the bust however. The windows could be opened from the top own for pictures, but they are very difficult to manage. They stop every 60 minutes to 90 minutes for rest stops. Midway they offer snacks and drinks. The views are incredible, and we saw Mountain goats, Ravens, Mocking Birds, Grizzlies and cubs, Caribou and Moose and calves, plus beautiful clear views of the snow covered Mountains, with brilliant sunshine. This was at the end of the season, Labor Day weekend, so we were very lucky. Most of the time the mountains are shrouded in clouds, but we saw it every day while we were there. The buses follow a very narrow road full of switchbacks on the edge of a cliff, I don't know how they do this several times a day!","September 12, 2016",Amazing environment and wldlife,40,"Rockaway, New Jersey",5

Denali,"We were lucky enough to see the top of Denali all day everyday! We were lucky enough to get on the shuttle to Eielson Visitor center with driver (guide) Chavez! 9am green bus shuttle cost us $44pp when we booked by telephone in May. But got $10pp refund to our credit card for all 4 by showing one National Park pass at the Visitor Center ticket station. No hassle at all. Chavez is such an excellent guide but he is a very, very professional, safe, considerate driver. He slows so he never covers hikers in dust. He offers advice and reassurance of driver training when the height and turns get scary!!! He taught us to spot animals and we saw a couple birds, grizzly and caribou very close. We saw eagle, mother bear and Cubs, Dall sheep, moose from afar.If you can get yourself to the park there is no reason to use any bus but the shuttle based on our experience with driver/guide Chavez. He knows park history, geography, lore, flora and wildlife. If you get on a bus with a bad driver get off at Eileson and try another. We thought we would get off and hike then catch another bus. But we did not have bear spray and we saw lots of wildlife from the bus. My traveling companions thought going on the earliest or latest bus might mean more wildlife closer to road?The Denali Shuttle to Eileson is the best bargain in Alaska. Bring your own lunch, water and snacks but don't get off the bus with food.","September 9, 2016","Sunshine, blue skies",180,"Navarre, Florida",5
Denali,"There are several ways to see Denali so you should research them carefully before you go in. I went on the six hour bus tour because I was with a package tour. We sat on the bus, drove around, and looked at magnificent scenery including wildlife in natural habitat. You can only take your personal car in so far so the bus isn't as lame as it sounds. If you're rigged, hike in. But there are no marked trails know what you're doing. If you go bus, take a good lunch. The sanctioned tour company says they have a snack pack but it is not very good.

We thought we would be able to get the time of bus we wanted no problem, but it turns out they were sold out for 7:30 and only had 1:00 available for our destination. Luckily, Sam came to our rescue and told us that we could buy the 1:00 and go on stand by for earlier buses. We were so lucky and got right on with the 7:30. Thanks, Sam!!We just paid for a normal bus in (not the guided tour) but our guide, River, made it very enjoyable! I thought all his insights and explaining of things was normal for the bus until we came home and our guide didn't talk at all. He was great!We went to Eielson and did the mile hike up 1,000. It's right across the road from the visitor's center. It's not exactly easy, but it's definitely worth it! We went to the top and over towards Denali a little more.

We flew in to Kantishna ( with a fly-by of the mountains from above the clouds ) from the entrance of the park then took the park's shuttle bus back to the entrance. The weather was the only downer. Wildlife is not abundant in the park, but it is there. The shuttle bus driver was very informative and had a good eye for spotting animals. We did see a grizzly and two cubs, several moose, and many caribou. The landscape is insanely beautiful. The six hour bus ride is long and rough on the back, and the wildlife spotting can be tough. After the flight around Denali, our teens weren't that impressed with the bus ride, but it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.","September 8, 2016",Stunning even on a rainy day,13,"Greenwich, Connecticut",4

We saw some wildlife, not close by, but that is the nature of nature! Our guide was very knowledgeable and skilled for the mountain roads. Sit on the inside when going around the hairpin curves if you are afraid of heights. There is no restroom in the bus but you make multiple stops at the park rest areas. The highlight of our tour was seeing Mt Denali without clouds surrounding it.

Denali,"We went on August 31st, and was lucky enough that the weather was sunny and we got to see Denali without being obscured by clouds. We took the shuttle bus to Wonder Lake. Make sure you buy tickets ahead of time, all tickets to Wonder Lake for August 31st and September 1st were sold out when we went on August 31st morning to catch our bus.The park was quite cold in the morning, the temperature felt like freezing, however it quickly warmed up during the day, and by 11am or so, the temperature was around 20 degrees Celcius, so make sure you wear layered clothes. I took other reviewer's advice and sat on the left side of the bus, which had proven to be the right choice as Denali mostly appears on the left side of the road. The bus driver was very experienced, and knew the places to stop for photos. He even went out of his way to stop at a pond so people could take photos of Denali with reflection in the pond. We saw a few caribous, brown bears, moose, although I think you need at least a 400mm lens to take close up photos of them.The view of Denali was best at the Eielson Center, and between Eielson Center and Wonder Lake.Some people recommended spending at least two days at Denali Park, however I think if you are just going to take the bus and not doing any hikes, and the weather is good so that you can see Denali on your first day, a one-day visit should be enough.","September 6, 2016",Wonderful experience,4,,5
Denali,The park is absolutely gorgeous but you are forced to ride shuttle buses (think school buses) to most of the points in the park. Private cars are only permitted as far as the Visitor Center.

Much of the time it is covered in fog and/or clouds, but if you are lucky, you will be among the 30 percent who actually see it. It is stunning. We managed to see it twice during our 16 days tour, so we were very lucky. It looks like a giant, glittering white diamond rising from the earth. And yes, I got some great photos.

What an amazing experience! We lucked out with sunny weather and had crystal clear views of Denali & the surrounding mountains every day.

Denali,"My husband and I and our three boys (ages 16, 13, 11) recently visited the Denali area. You can only drive about 15 miles into the park to Savage River, so we agonized about whether to take a bus into the park. To go all the way is 92 miles. If you do take a bus, you have 2 choices. The shuttle buses or the more expensive tour buses look very similar - basically school buses with those tiny up and down windows. The shuttle busses let you get out and reboard along the way, but you have to wait for another bus and hope it has room. The tour buses you stay on for the duration - and that duration is either 5 hours or 9 hours! Both of these seemed to long for us, so in the end we didn't do it. Instead, we drove to Savage River and I am happy to report that we had a great experience and have no regrets. We had a nice crystal clear view of Denali around mile 9 or so. Plenty of room to pull over. We also saw several moose and caribou. When we got to Savage River, there is a parking lot and we got out and the kids skipped rocks in the river for a while. Then a caribou came right down near us to drink from the river! We did not see any bears, which we would have liked to have seen. We spoke to people who had been on the bus and they had seen moose, caribou, and bears. They told us that it was difficult for everyone to get a good view out of the awkward bus windows, and the day was very long, but they were happy to see the wildlife. We all decided that the trade off of the time on the bus v. seeing bears would not have been worth it for us. You may feel differently, but know that you will likely see animals just on the first 15 miles, and if it is clear you will get a great view of Denali. If it is not a clear day - you aren't going to see Denali either way! Also, there is an area called Riley Creek where you can park and walk some trails.

So worth spending the day at the beautiful National Park. We had a clear view of the mountain as well. What a perfect trip!","September 5, 2016",Tundra Wilderness Tour,0,,5
Denali,"We had a great bus driver/tour guide. We opted for the upgraded tour which got us further into the park, about 63 miles. It was a spectacular day weather wise which was a bonus for us. Our tour guide was awesome, he wanted to be the first tour into the park, and darn if he wasn't. He said there were a lot tours coming into the park, so we were off. It was so beautiful in the Park. We saw a fox, Caribou and a bear off into the distance. It was also 40 degrees at that time of the morning, brrrrr, but great weather.At the 63rd mile, there was Mt. McKinley or Mt. Denali. The sun was shining and we had the whole view to ourselves. We saw the North Peak, but clouds were hanging over the South Peak which is the one that people climb. It was gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Denali,"Take in the whole experience... don't be crushed if you don't see Denali itself - that's not uncommon during the summer. You'll still see enough landscapes and wildlife to make it all worthwhile. On our bus tour to Eielson, we saw numerous caribou, moose, and Dall sheep, along with a family of grizzlies and a very nice rainbow. We hiked from Eielson down to the river bed. I don't think many do that but it gave a very different vista. The regular park shuttle buses are comfortable enough and both drivers we had were very willing to give extensive commentaries. ","September 5, 2016",Magnificent!,21,"Crestwood, Kentucky",5
Denali,"All the travel books said to take the longer 63 mile tour for the additional cost. I imagine that if you just took the regular tour, you really won't see that much. On our tour, we really didn't see anything up close. Remember, this is a large national park, not a theme park or zoo, so the animals are in their environment, and it is the luck of whatever day or hour you go. A group behind us say both a bear and a moose cross the road in front of them. Two days before our tour, a grizzly had caught and killed a moose. We just saw a grizzly, moose and caribou in the distance. However, if you do not like traveling on gravel roads, 90 degree turns while riding along with a VERY large drop next to your bus, with busses coming the other way, passing in a spot that the front of your bus is actually hanging over the cliff (some ladies screamed at one point), then you may want to think twice. I enjoyed seeing this for the first time, would I take this excursion again if I go back? Definitely not, it is not the drop that scares me, it's the sudden landing.","September 5, 2016",Excellent??

Denali,"We were lucky to have good weather. We did two tours and on the second day was actually able to see both peaks - barely - of Denali Mountain (formerly Mt. McKinley). We did the all day, 11-hour tour and it was well worth it. You get to see the whole park, all 92 miles of it. We also did the Tundra tour, but were sorry we did. It is just a shorter version of what you see in the full day excursion. Pick one or the other but not both. Since there is only one road, you are pretty stuck on it. You should know that you are in a bus, and not a luxury one, the whole tim except for a few bio breaks. That's a lot of sitting. The tour provides a box lunch and drinks, but I would recommend that you bring some extra. At the end of day you are starving and the trip back is about 2 hours. Lots of wildlife to take pictures of but you have to do it from the bus. The drivers stop often and let you take photos so you won't miss much.

Denali,"Denali is an amazing place with the views and the wildlife. We were fortunate to have perfect weather for viewing both the. The guides indicate that only 30% of the visitors get to see the mountain, but if you do it is well worth the visit. Definitely take one of the bus tours into the interior of the park, this is where we saw the most wildlife.","September 1, 2016",An Awesome Place to Visit,104,"Redmond, Oregon",5

Also got a good view of the mountain. Our tour guide/bus driver was very knowledgeable","August 31, 2016",Amazing,27,"North Vancouver, British Columbia",5
Denali,"After several weeks of cloudy, rainy weather, we were extremely pleased to be able to see the summits that are Mt Denali. And how amazing and beautiful. We took the shuttle only as far as Eielson Visitor Center as a rock slide had closed the road further in. All in all, it was a long enough trip. Our bus driver was very knowledgable and stopped whenever wildlife was sighted, however we thought we would see more wildlife. We were impressed how the traffic in is controlled in order to allow the animals to live without human intervention. Hiking is very informal and all levels are possible. If the weather is good, take the shuttle, you'll be glad you did. ","August 31, 2016",Fortunate to see summit,4,"Sloan, Iowa",4

Denali,"We took the glass top ""Wilderness Express"" train to Denali, an excursion to see the Alaskan wildlife, and the bus ride back to the port of Seward. I enjoyed the novelty of the train ride. We had breakfast on the train and it was actually pretty good. They offer Rain deer sausage which I tried. It was good, but in a blindfold test I probably couldn't tell the difference between regular sausage and Rain deer sausage. The ""AM Tundra Wilderness Tour"" excursion was worth the money. We saw brown bear (at a distance), moose, caribou, and a bald eagle. We elected to take the bus ride back to the port of Seward. We actually enjoyed the bus ride more than the train as you actually get to see more wildlife and have the option to stop and take pictures. You can't do that on the train option. Having said that, the degree to which you will enjoy any of your excursions is directly correlated to personality and background of your tour guide. The train ride guide was good, but, in my opinion, the bus ride tour was better. Most tours don't actually get to see the top of Denali due to cloud cover at the top. Although we only saw about half of the mountain, what we did see was most impressive.","August 31, 2016",Well worth the trip,7,"Williamsburg, Virginia",5
Denali,"OMG. Apparently the weather this week is the best it has been all season. We were among the 3% who get to see Denali in all her glory. The Tundra Wilderness Tour was amazing.

Denali,Denali is beautiful- it's got some of the most amazing scenery I have ever seen! And I know I will never forget- we were blessed as we had great weather were able to see Mt Denali for all 3 days we were there with no clouds. I didn't give it a 5 star as I expected more wildlife- it was sad to hear that for a 6million acre park there's only a few thousand caribou and few hundred grizzly bears and only about 48wolves left. It appears the wildlife do tend to leave the park boundaries and then are subject to hunting. And that's very sad- such amazing wildlife and animals that contribute to the most beautiful of places are still threatened. ,"August 30, 2016",Breathtaking!!,52,,4
Denali,"We came here from anchorage and were able to get right on a tour the same day. We chose the tolkat river tour, 6.5 hr tour. We saw moose, caribou, wolf, Ptarmigan, and a hawk. Great way to spend the day!","August 30, 2016",Cool national park,5,,5

Denali,"Recalling the beauty of Denali National Park on our first visit to Alaska, we included Denali on our second Alaska trip. Once again, we rode the park shuttle to the Eielson Visitor Center at mile 66 of the park road. Along the way, our watchful and informative bus driver spied wildlife for us. We saw caribou, eagles, and many bears. The driver stopped the bus for us to watch a bear eating blueberries in the bushes. Later, we watched a mother bear and two cubs eating their way up a hillside. In the afternoon, we watched and photographed a bear just a few feet from the bus – magnificent! Inside the visitor center, we found something that we did not see on our earlier visit – in front of the large picture window that would give a great view of Denali on an uncloudy day, brass markers on the floor show where people of different heights should stand. On the window, lines show where the two peaks of Denali would be on a clear day. Unfortunately for us, Denali did not show her splendor on this day. The visitor center has a small exhibit and good restroom facilities. Park rangers are helpful; they lead informative walks in the area. Hiking in Denali NP is informal, but a few defined trails are maintained. At Eielson, we walked the easy Tundra Loop trail. At the park entrance, we hiked the trail to and around Horseshoe Lake where we watched a moose eating dinner. We hoped to hike at the splendor of Polychrome, but bear activity prevented us.

The bus was comfortable and on the way out he stopped often for photos, he was not so keen on stopping on the way back so perhaps thinking of dinner awaiting him.The park itself is great and it was a pity we did not get the closer photos of wild animals that we would have liked but it is the luck of the draw as another lady showed us close up photos of the bear that came right to their bus!There is plenty of time to get on and off the bus and the 8 hour return trip did not seem that long.","August 29, 2016",Quick Trip,23,Auckland,5

A few helpful hints, grab a Subway sandwich in the morning as the box lunch isn't much. They provide water on the bus but it's room temp. There are plenty of bathroom stops along the way but they are still porta potty type stops, have some hand sanitizer or wet ones, The scenery is amazing!

Denali,"We were lucky enough to have nice weather. Despite that, we barely saw Mount McKinley (Denali). WSe took the 5 hours afternoon tour. We saw some wildlife (moose, and some caribous). Our disapointment was that the bus doesn't get you to Mont McKinley. You are about 40 miles from there. The tour shows you the wilderness of Denali National Part, not Mount Denali. But we enjoyed the ride and the guide knows so much about that park that it worth the price.","August 25, 2016",Interesting but....,97,"Ottawa, Canada",4

Denali,"My shuttle bus driver, Tim, was the greatest. He knew everything and we had a guided tour. The park info says it has no narrative and apparently it isn't required of the driver, so I guess it depends who you get. Mine was amazing. He'd been doing it for many years. I wasn't sure if I'd want more time to look around at places but was worried after reading it's a school bus with bench seats. It wasn't; actually there are bucket sort of seats that are fairly comfy. We had plenty of time at many stops to take pictures and look around. We had about half an hour at many stops and stopped about once an hour on the 11 hour tour. No food in the park so pack snacks, lunch, and water bottle in a backpack and take it with you. You can leave your stuff on the bus. Numerous stops for bears, moose, sheep, etc. and driver was happy to move the bus around so people could all get a good shot. I went on the Wonder Lake route...next time I may add that last couple miles, I've heard mixed reviews and the driver says it all depends on the day. We couldn't see but an occasional glimpse on Denali that day, but of the three days I was there, at least I got to see it on one of them. Usually it's covered in clouds. Bathrooms on the stops are clean and after you get out so far the lines seem to end, which are short anyway. The cost of this trip was a lot more reasonable than I had expected. Staying at the campground in a pop tent is easy and very budget conscious. The tour on the shuttle is also reasonable. There are plenty of expensive things to do, but you don't have to go that route to have an awesome time and see the park!","August 24, 2016",The shuttle bus is great!,6,"San Jose, California",5
Denali,"We saw 12 grizzlies, 4 moose, about 15 caribou and lots of sheep. The park is even more beautiful than I'd heard.

Resting after lunch was an option or you could choose several activities, pan for gold, learn about the history of Denali or take a ranger led Botany walk. I chose to relax in the lodge upstairs room with big stuffed chairs and sofas. There is a bar up there and coffee service as well as a small gift shop. All service people were friendly. The outside premises were beautiful, easily walkable, and best of all you had a choice to fly back rather then take the bus for a fee this year of $289.

We went to the Visitor's Center to see if we could change our bus tour from the 9:15 am tour to Wonder Lake to the 5:15 am green bus tour. We wanted to have the option to get off and on at our leisure. It was sold out, but we went standby the next morning and were able to get on the 5:15 am bus tour. It was excellent! Our bus driver was fantastic and gave us an amazing narrative throughout the day. I'm glad we did the earlier tour since we saw Denali for a few hours in the morning before it got cloudy. We saw caribou that decided to hang out in the road along with bears and their cubs. We also were fortunate to see Dall sheep and a moose. Fortunately, the mosquitoes weren't bad the day that we were at Wonder Lake, but we were happy that we were prepared with our mosquito head nets. That morning, we thought we were going to get off at the Eielson Visitor Center because the bus ride was going to be too long. Needless to say, that the trip was amazing so we went all the way to Wonder Lake. I recommend going to see the National Park Dog Sled presentation. It was very informative and it was nice to meet the dogs. It is the only National Park that has Park Rangers that patrol the park in the winter with dog sled teams. Also, I was read on another post to only go to Wonder Lake on a day that does rain and if it does rain, to go as far as Eielson Visitor's advice.

Denali,We stayed in cantwell about 15 miles from the park entrance/denali visitor center. You can park and take a free shuttle to everywhere a private person can drive. They encourage the shuttle because of the limited parking. We took a chance & drove ourselves. You can only go to mile 15 of the park road though. To really go further into the park you have to prearrange a paid bus tour. Many of them take all day & we just didn't want to be stuck in a bus.At about mile 9 of the park road you can actually see Mt Mckinley if it's a clear day. There are spots to pull over & take photos. We lucked out & had great views!! Then once you get to the savage river area you have to either turn around or if you are lucky you will find a parking spot. We again lucked out & got one of the 20 spots. There are some picnic benches if you want to picnic. & there are several hiking trails.On our drive out we saw a caribou cross the road. He was beautiful!In the summer you can also visit the working sled dog facility & pet some of the dogs & see a demo.

Do not come here unless you take the Tundra Wilderness Tour at a minimum. Breathtaking scenery and vistas. Don't expect much shopping opportunity or spotless bathroom facilities.","August 17, 2016",Breathtaking and Spectacular,57,"Corydon, Indiana",5
Denali,"We stayed in lodging in the interior of the Park for 4 nights. We were fortunate to get to see the entire mountain on one sunny day, in addition to several other times briefly on other days. We live in CO where there are lots of big mountains, but none of them compare to Denali. It is difficult to describe the massiveness of this mountain. It's an incredible sight when it's out. Recommend staying at one of the interior Park lodges (not at the Park entrance) to increase your chances of seeing the mountain and to avoid the very long and exhausting round trip bus ride in one day.","August 17, 2016","When it's out, WOW!",136,,5
Denali," We started at 8am from Talkeetna,distance to Denali visitor centre around 300 miles.We crossed Sushitna river,Trapper's creek. it was raining in morning ,stopped veterans memorial Park..The journey was full of pretty locales.We saw the national alaskan tree, the Spruce. as we are approaching Tundra region only small bushes were seen.Panorama mountain became visible,way shorter than mount Denali.Reached Denali visitor centre at 11.15 am.Now School bus Would be taking us For tundra wilderness tour in the park around 1.30pm.

On the way to George Parks highway we saw caribou and Moose,Th e tea was running on the road ahead our bus. One Snowshoe hare was also seen on one side of the road. We all were Very excited,wanting to see grizzly bear.Now we had reached Denali view point. We got down,There were few stairs,climbed, then climbed little more and got to the top of High Alpine Tundra, Having Stunning, mesmerising views, could see glaciers,snow peaks, volcano mountain all around. it was truly a surreal moment for me,thinking time should stop and just be there.Weather here was pleasantly cold. Finally we had to get down into the bus.Now we were returning,somebody spotted a bear,and lo,it was indeed bear. Our driver cum guide took snap and projected on the screen in the bus. After going further , This time one more bear. Then further ahead,could spot Mama bear with 3 calves and they were quite near.We were thrilled absolutely. Every body clicked and clicked.

I can't imagine what else we could have learned about the park and it's wildlife on the much more expensive ""guided bus tour"" Craig was our driver and was absolutely a fountain of knowledge and wit.

Denali,"You can not believe the expanse of land, mountains and we were lucky enough to see Mt. Detail (Mt. McKinley)! It was a day of blue skies. The 8 hour Tundra Wilderness tour was perfect. Our tour guide/bus driver, George was fantastic. We were able to see many animals and he explained the various points of the landscape. We were in awe. There were stops made along the way and many pictures takes.

Denali,"We took the green bus three days in a row. First to wonder lake. The next two days to eielson and got off to hike. We took advantage of the hop on and hop off system. The bus driver can truly make the difference in completing an amazing trip. Barr and Craig were the two drivers who really made it a special day. Answering questions and giving narration. They both had great eyes for wildlife. We saw bear- 4 on day 1 (one ate a ground squirrel right next to the bus), day 2 we saw 2 sets of mothers with Cubs and day 3 we saw another 2 bears. We even saw a wolverine!My advise to travelers is that if your driver isn't stopping or the other passengers seem grumpy, get off the bus and walk for 15-30 minutes. A new bus will come along, likely with an informative driver and a group which is more lively! As a side note, the brown bus was always packed. The green bus leaves seats free to pick up hikers.

Moose, Grizzly bears, caribou and Dall sheep were all seen and photographed. We even were treated to the Northern Lights at 1:30 in the morning.

Denali,"Alsaka trip is something most of us won’t get do very often with our families, especially if you are coming from outside USA. One can always take a week’s cruise and then there is the right way of doing it. That’s the way we went, a family of eight, from 70 to 7, normally distributed. We decided to move on our own, hired two cars and set our own pace. Two of us travelled from Asia, two from New York and the other four came from Singapore. Planning for the trip must start, at least four months in advance (earlier the better) and it is not cheap. Food quality has been excellent throughout our stay in Alaska. Here’s the program:-D Day : Arrive at night in Anchorage. Suggested place to stay: Hilton Homewood suites.D+1: Morning, walk through the ‘Earthquake Park’. Lunch, go around the town, there are plenty of ‘Farmer’s markets’. Afternoon, walk through the ‘Kincaid Park’. (excellent)D+2: Morning, drive to Whittier. Stop at ‘Wildlife Conservatory’ to see bears, moose, elk, reindeer, bison, foxes etc. Do the ‘26 Glacier Cruise’ with Philip cruises from 12:30 to 5:30. (this can get very cold as boats move upwards of 60 Kmph). Move on to Seward. Suggested place to stay: Harbor 360 hotel. Dinner at Ray's waterfront.D+3: Morning, Drive to ‘Exit Glacier’ and hike up to it. Lunch at ‘Chinooks’. Afternoon, drive to ‘Lowell Point’ for views of ‘Resurrection’ bay. Then take an evening walk around downtown (avoid the shopping centers, there are plenty of other ways to contribute to the local economy).D+4: Morning, hike to ‘Mt. Marathon’ trail from 9:30 to 12 noon. Then drive to ‘Talkeetna’. Lunch on the way. Arrive at Talkeetna at 5:15 and take a walk around town (ten minutes). Suggested place to stay: Alaskan Lodge. Dinner at mountain high ( Buffalo pizza recommended, tried to bribe the chef to come with us to New York, no success).D+5: Morning, take a flight seeing tour and glacier landing with ‘Talkeetna Air Taxi’ (not to be missed at any cost). Afternoon, rafting on ‘Susitna River’ from 5-7 pm. Dinner at the ‘Wildflower’.D+6: Morning, leisure drive to Denali (three hours). Afternoon, trek to ‘Horseshoe Lake’ trail. Visit the wildlife Centre to make reservations for park bus. Suggested place to stay: Grand Denali Lodge.D+7: Whole day trip on hop on-off buses to ‘Eielson Visitor Center’ in the park. Easy to spot grizzly bear, moose, caribou and Dall sheep. Do it asap as wild life have a mind of their own. D+8: Plan a trek in ‘Savage River Alpine’ trail ( in our case whole route got shut down due to a bear attack). So we switched over to ‘Mountain Vista’ trail. Stopped by the river, collected huge chunks of crystal clear glacier ice for our evening drink. Afternoon, took ‘Mt. Healy Overlook’ trail ( had eye ball to eye ball confrontation with a 1500 lb. moose who was blocking the trail for an afternoon snack, he finally took pity on us). Beautiful views on top but very strenuous hike ( four hours).D+9: Morning, drive back from Denali to Anchorage ( 4-5 hour drive). Take flight to Juneau. (one of the most scenic flights). See ‘Mt. Elias’, several snow capped mountains and glaciers followed by coastline). Stayed at ‘Goldbelt hotel’. D+9: Half the group went to ‘Fairbanks’, lunch and for local visit, took evening flight back to New York.D+10: Morning, go to ‘Mendenhall’ glacier and ‘Nugget Falls’, beautiful places. Then lunch at ‘Taku’ followed by a hike to ‘Perseverence’ trail via a walk through the town. Really pretty town. D+11: Morning, whale watching cruise with ""whale tales"" for 3 hours. Lunch at local ‘Ribs Shack’, followed by walk to Governors house. Evening flight back to which ever crazy Place you live in.Footnote: need to remain fit to enjoy the trip. Keep snacks & water handy but no need to over do it. Bring warm clothes in layers. If you want to pick up mementos, then airport on way out is the place for it.","August 12, 2016",ALASKA IN 10(+2) DAYS,68,"New Delhi, India",4
Denali,"We were in Denali National Park for approx. 4 cloudy and rainy days and had pretty much accepted the fact that we may not get to see the mountain during our trip. We were very surprised and excited when we woke up on our 5th day to clear skies and perfect views of the mountain. I would have never thought that simply viewing a mountain would be so awe inspiring , but that's because I have never been in the presence of ""The High One."" It was really a sight to be seen. Luckily for us we were in the backcountry that morning at the North Face Lodge, and as we made our way out of the Park we were able to see Denali in The Reflection Pond, beyond Wonder Lake, as we traveled along the park road above the McKinley River, from The Eielson Visitor Center, and from other iconic viewpoints.

Fantastic scenery and wildlife can be as close as next to your bus, we had a Grizzly bear and her 3 cubs walking next to our bus. We saw from a distance other Grizzly bears, Caribou, deer/elk. We went as far as Eielson Visitor center and went off the beaten track for a 3 hour hike and came close to a heard of approx 100 Caribou. Saw amazing birds and wild flowers and stunning mountain scenery.","August 11, 2016","Amazing, stunning scenery & wildlife",140,"Shellharbour, Australia",5
Denali,"We rented a car in Anchorage and drove to Denali NP, staying two nights at Park's Edge in Healy. Took the Kantishna Experience bus tour of Denali, booking on the NP website about 5 months in advance. This was one of the buses that takes visitors to the ""end of the road"" and took about 12 1/2 hours round trip, departing the Wilderness Access Center at 6:00am. Our driver gave a narrative with history of the park's founding, fauna, flora, weather, geology and made numerous stops for photo opportunities, including stops for every animal spotting. We were extremely fortunate to have a sunny day, and viewed The Great One in its entirety with no clouds for the first half of our day, with our driver making several stops just for photo ops of Denali (aka Mt McKinley) and of Polychrome Pass. A bag of snacks, bottled water, and a sandwich lunch were provided on the bus, but we had also brought plenty of our own water and snacks. A park ranger joined us and gave a great narrative tour once we reached Reflection Pond, taking us off of the bus for some walking. I was impressed with the number of animals that we spotted, given that the park and wilderness area encompass over 6 million acres of land; we experienced a Grand Slam Plus as we saw moose (cow with calf, 6 bulls), Dall sheep, several caribou, grizzly sow with 2 cubs, a fox, two wolves, loons, arctic ground squirrels, and ptarmigan (Alaska state bird). The animals were varying distances from the bus, and we were glad to have good binoculars and a camera with telephoto lens for some of the viewing. We only spent one day in the park, so we were very happy for the option of the bus excursion. In the future, we will allow for more days and do some hiking or try for one of the limited RV spots in the park. The weather varies greatly, and of course there is no way to ""plan for"" a sunny day. On all of our other days spent in the area the sky was dark with clouds and there was intermittent rain, but this did not diminish the beauty. Can hardly wait to return!","August 11, 2016",Spectacular!,9,"Midland, Texas",5

(This is called the ""cupcake"" because of the white frosted appearance.) We got to see it all, in its magnificent glory. And what a sight! You don't realize that the small ""hills"" in front of Denali are actually mountains that are 7,000-8,000 feet tall because Denali is over 20,000 feet. Amazing! It is truly an awe-inspiring sight, even without all the other sights of the park surrounding it. Take a tour with a knowledgeable guide; it is money well-spent.

Landscape is tundra and taiga--home to many uniquely adapted plants and animals. Caribou are common but not the massive herds seen way up north. Moose, brown bears, Dall sheep are commonly seen from the main road that goes 85 miles into the interior of the park to Kantishna past Wonder Lake.

However, most were far away to be captured by my 200 zoom camera lens. We saw 7 grizzly bears with cubs, 6-8 moose, several caribou - one with a huge rack, Dahl sheep, ground squirrels, ptarmigan birds and a rare black wolf.

During our 4 days there we've only seen the mountain once on approach.There are reasonable number of animals in the park, particularly plentiful are caribou, but not as many as in Yellow Stones.The single park road is closed to private cars and you have to ride a shaky park bus for which you need tickets in advance. Because of the advance tickets, you can not adjust your plans due to weather - bus goes rain or shine.Seen 3 or 4 bears was nice but not worth 11 hours bus trip.","August 3, 2016",Long road to nowhere,14,"Los Altos, California",3
Denali,"Wow! What a beautiful place. The bus tour of the park is a must. The bus is a traditional school bus style so comfort is minimal but it should not be a show stopper. Potty stops are about every 45 minutes to an hour. If you can't wait that long the bus driver will stop and let you go behind a tree. The tour guides are excellent. You will see some wildlife but luck plays a role in that. I was fortunate the weather was exceptionally good on the day of my visit so the view of Mt. Denali was spectacular. The tour guide told us that good weather days only happen 20-30 percent of the time. Good luck. If you are photography buff this is a great tour but don't let photography depend on a smartphone.

Denali,"Denali, the mountain (formally Mt. McKinley) is beautiful and breath taking. But you probably won't see the actual mountain it self....it MUST be a clear day, and only 30% of those who visit will see the mountain. Denali makes it's own weather, truly the mountain still controls it all,which makes since, as it is still growing. You will need to be an experienced hiker with a guide to climb the mountain and actually be on it and touch it. But if you do, it is breath taking and so worth it!!! The National park and preserve also has a lot to offer but you can only drive to mile post 15 and then you either hike it or take the very long indoors bus ride for 8 hours and you still will not be on the mountain. No worries though there is plenty to do and see as it starts right outside of Talkeetna which you may get a better view of the mountain from there while driving to Denali or back from Denali. Make sure you do your research about free things to do, ranger lead hikes, the cost of tours, etc. It is still well worth going to Denali, the park, and preserve as long as you really know what to expect. Go to the 49th State Restaurant it's in Healy, great food and atmosphere, but a really long wait to be seated, but worth it!

Denali,"My daughter, niece, and I stayed in Carlo Creek and drove the few minutes up to the park on June 1. We had reserved a park shuttle prior to our leaving home. I almost waited too late because there were limited spots still available when I booked three seats about a month prior to our arrival. June 1 was the first day the road was open to the Eielson visitor center area. We arrived early so we drove back into the park a few miles and saw a moose after just going a few miles. Then we boarded the shuttle for the 3 hour or so trip back to Eielson. We stopped a couple of times for restroom breaks. The drive was beautiful with ever-changing scenery. On the way to Eielson, we saw dall sheep upon the mountains....mostly little specks unless you have binoculars or a good zoom lens! We crossed Polychrome Pass and stopped at the top for pictures. I must say, this was nerve-wracking. I finally just closed my eyes and did the same on the return journey. The road is narrow---think one lane---and the drop is 700 feet with NO guard rails. We met a bus going the other way. Once the bus had passed I looked for the tracks and they were mere inches from the edge. I really don't think I could do it again. Eielson was nice but the clouds were firmly in place so we did not get to see Denali. Our driver told us it can only be seen about 30% of the time. We saw lots of moose, caribou, and a few grizzlies! We were slightly less than one hour from the end of our trip when we came upon a grizzly kill side just off the road. Two grizzlies were eating their prey. Our driver stopped and we watched for several minutes. What a sight! This was a long day and I am glad I took the tour. Denali is a beautiful park.","August 1, 2016",A Long But Exciting Day!,67,Kentucky,5

Because of this the windows got pretty dirty as most of the road in the park was dirt and it was hard to see out. Also we only saw one moose, three caribou and two bears. And we only saw them pretty well because we had binoculars. The buses were the hop on/hop off type so if you wanted to stay a little longer at a specific stop you could wait about 10 minutes and another bus would come. If you're afraid of heights don't sit on the left on the way in and the right on the way out. We took the Toklat tour which was about 6 hours. I think plenty long to be on a school bus.

Definitely bring binoculars!!! A nice Asian man let us borrow his to see the bears. Saw one caribou. Saw mother ptarmigan and her chicks at the side of the road. Stops for breaks were well spaced, every 1-2 hours. Pit toilets were pretty clean and smell not too bad, considering. Small gift shop by river. NIce assortment, even books.

Denali,"We knew going in that only about 30% of visitors see Mt. Denali. We were among the 70% who did not. Despite that, the Park is a feast for the eyes. I only give it 4 stars due to the limited access via school-type buses. You are able to drive your car in to about 15 miles, but this is not to the best parts, in my opinion. We opted for the 8-hour trip to Eielson (mm 66), but there is one option beyond which makes for a 12 hour day. (Wonder Lake, mm 89). Given the weather of intermittent showers visibility was greatly reduced. The saving grace was that we saw 2 grizzly bears, 2 moose, several caribou, and some sheep. Just be sure to pick a clear day should you have enough time. Prepare for a long, uncomfortable, but still ""well-worth it"" ride on the park buses ($34/ adult). They were very good at keeping on schedule. Our driver, Nan, was excellent at spotting and informing.

They are no different from the tour buses, except the meals. But you defintely do not want to spend tons of extra money just for a lunch box. The drivers were very knowledgeable and helped to spot plenty of wildlife. We saw a herd of caribous crossing the road, several mooses with one drinking in a pond, dall sheep, 2 foxes, birds, and several grizzly bears (one with 2 cubs on a hill, one eating berries on a hill as well, one with her cub crossing a river and the highlight was a bear on the road walking by our shuttle, how cool that is!!!). Most of the animals were from distance so be prepared with your binoculars. We did not get good luck with the mountain because it was a very cloudy day. The view in the park was spectacular especially at the Polychrome pass. Wonder lake was also nice, maybe would be much nicer in a clear day with refection of the mountain! We found lots of blueberries around the lake!! One of the advantage of the shutte is that you can hop on and hop off as you please. We actually got off at Eileison visitor center on the way back to do a short hike into the tundra and saw lots of artic squirrels.

Tour guides are knowledgeable and don't hover over you during the stop points which is nice. There were some bears close to the road during one stop so the park rangers had us stay on one side of the street. Safety is definitely a priority which was nice. A very fun day.

Denali,"As part of our Land Tour we had an Excursion to Denali , we had a fun and knowledgeable driver who made the day very interesting and educational. At a lot of the scheduled stops we were unable to get off the bus because of bears. Not that they were all over but they had been a lot of siding in a few incidences with some tourists. We are very fortunate to get a glimpse of part of Denali the day we were here. We saw moose, caribou and the state bird forget the name? The first stop has an 18-minute movie that explains the history past and present of the park and the making of the road you drive on to see what you see comma really interesting very worth your time.","July 25, 2016",Informative and scenic,3,,4
Denali,"We started out at the Visitor's Center at the entrance to the park. The ranger was very helpful and recommended this trail. We were a family of 5 consisting of 3 generations. This hike was phenomenal. It was between 2 1/2 - 3 mile walk round trip and had gorgeous scenery. The lake was a beautiful lake and we were fortunate to see a beaver swimming pull a long tree limb to add to its dam. We were so close that we were able to snap pictures and a video. This trail was a fairly easy walk with some up and down areas. We all thoroughly enjoyed our walk and being in the park. It is absolutely beautiful. It was raining the day we did the walk, but we had on rain jackets so we were fine. We spent 3 days in Denali and didn't get to see the mountain until we were on our way back to Anchorage, but the park itself was beautiful. Well worth the trip.","July 25, 2016",Horseshoe Lake Trail Hike,1,"Hebron, Kentucky",5
Denali,"As others have said, the only way to see this park is to take either a tour bus or the shuttle bus, which are not operated by the National Park Service. On advice, we decided to book tickets on the shuttle bus and chose the 11 hour journey to Wonderlake. Make sure you take enough food and water for the duration. You are allowed to leave your bags in the bus at the various stops as they encourage you to eat in the bus rather than outside. The driver was extremely knowledgeable and although not obligated to, virtually gave us commentary the whole journey to help us understand this massive wilderness area. It was a very long day, but we are glad we chose this longer journey as the terrain did change dramatically after the visitor centre. We were pretty lucky with the weather as it only rained near WonderLake. However we are part of the 70% club who never saw Mount Denali in full and we did feel disappointed!!!! We did see bears, moose, a red fox, caribou and some smaller wildlife as well as some Cubs of various species. However we have seen much more wildlife up closer in other National Parks. On reflection tho, it was a wonderful experience and something you have to do when visiting Alaska. Your camera will never do justice to the immense wilderness that you see.","July 25, 2016",No view of the Mountain for us!!!!,203,"Scotland, United Kingdom",4

We didn't see a lot of wildlife up close, but the mountains and land formations are amazing. Our guide was very good and gave us lots of facts about the park and its wildlife. I came away with a much better appreciation for nature and how majestic this area really is. We didn't see the mountain on the day we were on our tour, but we did see it 2 days later before our trip to Talkeetna. We became part of the 30% club that day. I will never forget that vision.

Denali,"We did all the research about the best places to see the mountain without paying extra money to take a bus or plane. We knew the odds were small and as we drove in from Fairbanks we saw heavy fog. But we stopped in the visitor's center for an hour and asked where the best viewing spots are on the way to Anchorage. The parks employee gave me a map and circled the best viewing spots, reminding me that there is only a 30% chance of seeing the mountain. Then we had lunch and started toward Anchorage. We had also consulted a website about the best viewing places. By the time we drove to the North Denali View and pulled into the parking lot, the mountain came out of hiding! We also stopped at South Denali View but the mountain was back in clouds. We stopped once more near Willow and saw the whole range.","July 24, 2016",Rewarded with good views,74,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

We travelled 62 miles into the park and saw many bears...one with 2 cubs, moose, caribou, fox and many small animals. We really liked the video camera feature of our bus, where the driver could catch the animals in his video camera and bring them closer on the video screen.

Denali,"Denali is an incredible park, and one worth seeing at least once in a lifetime. I appreciate the desire to lessen any human impact, but the school bus ride was very undesirable. Not wanting/able to hike in, and only having a limited time to visit the park, the bus was the only viable option. However, stuck in the back of the bus prevented us from being able to interrupt (even with many voices) our knowledgeable but exceptionally verbose driver to slow for wildlife (seeing pictures is just not the same). Additionally, unless you are a child or under 5'5"", the seats are cramped and made for an uncomfortable ride. The windows on our bus were dirty (it was a clear day with sun) and the bar across the middle hit many of us right in our line of sight. If I could only rank the bus ride, it would be poor and the park an excellent.","July 24, 2016",Love the park; hated the bus ride,14,"York Springs, Pennsylvania",4

Denali,"Loved, loved, the park, even though it rained the entire time. Saw LOTS of wildlife, but not the mountain. To the end of the road bus tour gets long - but it's the only way to see, well, to the end of the road. For the price, the buses could be more comfortable. Took a shuttle the second day - and that was a good value.We applaud the Park for being strict about preserving the wilderness.","July 23, 2016",Hooray for Denali National Park - Protecting the Wilderness,50,"Palmyra, Pennsylvania",5
Denali,"This was an incredible National Park and we definitely plan to return some day, but I can't give it a perfect score because of the apparently non-family-friendly operation. Let me explain -- To travel more than 15 miles into the park you must ride on one of their buses. This was established years ago to minimize impact on the environment and wildlife and is good, in theory. Alaskan state law requires children, even on a bus, to be in a car seat. The buses you must ride on don't have car seats, so you must bring your own. When you arrive at your destination (assuming you want to actually walk around and not just sit on a bus) there is nowhere to store or stow your car seat. Park visitors with children are apparently expected to either carry the car seat around on a hike with them, leave it on the side of the road, or just sit on a bus and never actually explore the park on foot. It's baffling.Anyway, the first 15 miles of the park that we were able to explore were beautiful. We saw wildlife on every single hike and were doing 2-3 per day for our 4-day visit. As I said, we'll definitely return when our kids no longer need to ride in a car seat so we can explore deeper into the park.","July 23, 2016","Truly amazing, but hard to give a perfect score",29,"Seattle, Washington",4

The snack is heavy and probably was enough for lunch but we had also purchased box lunches - eaten on the bus. The scenery was outstanding, but because of clouds we did not see Denali. We did see an elk, Dall sheep, caribou and four bears. The bears were just yards off the road. We made two bathroom stops and stopped to view animals from the bus and also two scenery stops. Our guide Tom Richards gave great commentary and worked hard to be sure everyone saw the wildlife. A great tour. ","July 23, 2016",Tundra Wilderness Tour,25,Omaha,5

As we were driving north toward the park we pulled off at one of the viewing areas and for about 10 minutes we could see the mountain! This was before we had entered the park, so south of the park.The national park itself is incredible. We were so glad we had planned to stay multiple days. It snowed our first night which was unexpected, but we were thrilled to be present for the first snowfall. We did have to adjust some plans as the road and therefore traffic to the back of the park was affected, but it all worked out great.Plan to stay several days if you really want to see the park and hike the trails. We weren't sure if we would ever make it back so we wanted to make the most of our trip.

Denali,"No words to adequately describe this National Treasure. Just Wow, OMG, wow! We took the 6:30 am green bus shuttle, our driver was Anna. She did a fabulous job. She was peppy and engaging. The bus was like a school bus but so much better. This was a new bius and the seats were very similar to a motor coach type, but not quite. We rode for 8 hours and were comfortable the whole trip. You stop every hour or hour and a half so plenty of time to stretch out your legs. We almost decided not to go because it was raining and 56 degrees but I'm so glad we went. Apparently the animals love that type of weather. We saw plenty of Grizzlies, several moose and caribou. So many Grizzlies, even a mama and her two cubs. And we were fortunate to actually see Denali.

Denali,"Denali National Park is of course a great wonder and if you have the privilege of spotting Mt McKinley, then you are certainly one of the lucky ones! It feels vast and at first we wondered how we might experience such a place. We took the Shuttle out to Eielson Visitor Centre which is a wonderful and educational centre to visit. Did see a couple of grizzlies, caribou, moose and dall sheep. The weather was atrocious so no views! We also drove ourselves as far as Savage River & did the hike which is lovely but too many people at the time. There is also a lovely hike to Horseshoe Lake where you will most likely see moose & beavers! It's well worth a visit to the dog kennels where they house the working huskies and put on a show! My huge disappointment about Denali is the feeling that the wildlife is dwindling and park management don't really care about the large predators such as grizzlies and wolves. In the fall, the wolves follow the caribou and cross an area near Healy which is out of park bounds, where they are systematically trapped and shot. There were also a couple of unfortunate incidents involving bears whilst we were there and it was down to the stupidity of people, costing the bear its life. Please read up and prepare yourself for a possible encounter and do not try and feed them for distraction! We left feeling that the park staff, especially the Super does not have the best interest of the wolves and bears in mind, which was pretty sad considering that's what many people go for.

Drive the free park road because it's free andIf u go into the park, take the shuttle instead of the tour. You go farther for $90 less than the tundra tour. The only difference was lunch and a/c which would only come in play if it were very hot. The driver tells u about the park, there are regular rest stops, u keep your seat. We went to eilson visitor center for $33. If u don't have a lunch, they sell sandwiches and snacks at the wilderness center where u get your tickets. We bought our tickets the day before. You can get off the shuttle and get on another one later if u want. It is a well thought out experience. Sit on the drivers side going out. That's the best views. If you are wanting to see wildlife, be aware most are very far away. You will see lots of caribou. If you have a spectacular day, take a flight seeing tour. We went with fly Denali that flies right out of the Healy airport just north. They will pick you up if you need a ride. That was the best experience of the trip. 2.5 hrs of amazing sights of Denali and landing on a glacier. To summarize: pick the best day and take the shuttle.

We watched a dog sledding ""show"" and took Rockcreek trail to the meadow view trail to the road side trail to the visitors center. Nice walk mostly down hill after the first few uphill sections. Took maybe 45 minutes. The shuttle (green) bus suited us well. Just enough narrative and the driver stopped at all creature photo ops. A day long bus- tour or shuttle- is a must to really see the park. ","July 14, 2016",Memorable. The kids won't forget. ,116,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Denali,"While the cruise ships would lead you to believe that one or two nights is enough here, you need at least three nights or more to really see the park and do all that there is to do here. By the time we rode the train from Anchorage, we were too tired to do much that night. The second day, we did the tundra tour and a photo excursion and didn't get done until almost 10 PM. The third day, we had to be up and on our way to the cruise. Take your time to really see the park. Ask for Peter Berman for your tundra tour. He was an excellent guide! We saw wolves, bears, caribou and lots of birds. This park is so beautiful, you will never want to leave (well until the first snowfall when the park closes!)","July 14, 2016",Plan to stay a while,74,"Bradenton, Florida",5
Denali,We took a shuttle tour while visiting! Our driver was very informative and easily pointed out wildlife. He stopped often for us to take photos.

The tour is a definite must while visiting Denali!,"July 14, 2016",Nice tour,2,"Rochester, New York",5
Denali,"We were booked at the Backcountry Lodge, 92 miles into the park, so we took their bus. On the way into the park, and three days later out again, we saw bears, Dahl sheep, ravens, swans, caribou, moose, and other animals in their natural habitat. The scenery along the way was breathtaking.","July 14, 2016","Natural wonder, natural beauty",21,"Dumfries, Virginia",5

Denali,"Denali Park is a spectacular expanse of wilderness that you simply have to see to appreciate. Words can't do justice, nor can the photos we took - the sheer scale of valleys carved by glaciers and surrounded by mountain ranges is hard to capture and even harder to describe. I've been to many national and state parks, and this one is definitely the crown jewel of the national park system.

Denali,"Travel to Denali by car and stay close by. You can only use your own vehicle up to mile 15 and then you have to use either the green bus that travel through the park, this is relatively cheap and stops at several places for you to get off and on, if trekking or camping, otherwise you have to book one of the arranged tours within the Park and these are not cheap. We did a 13 hour trip which cost around $350 for 2. As usual with wildlife it is hit or miss, we saw several bears, moose, caribou, ptarmigan, hares etc, but these are not guaranteed as this was our second visit and we saw very little the first time. Travel by your own car was restricted to mile 13 as there had been a bear incident and some of the road was closed except to coaches. We hiked a short trail which was very nice and was advised by Park Ranger which route to take as some were close as mention above.

Unlike other National park in Denali you don't have to hike to see the wild animals like Grizzly, Caribou, Moose. First glimpse of Mount Denali visible between 9-11 mile of the park road. Our tour bus travelled up to East Fork of Toklat river bridge. This scenic area at 3500 ft, has a scenic view of the Toklat river.

(The moose was the icing on the cake, by the roadside, eating brush, and her baby was scampering...so so sweet. She stayed and fed for several minutes.)We did the 8 hour tour, 62 miles in and back. Overcast day and about an hour, if that, of a light mist. Rest stops every 90 minutes, box lunch on the bus...however, we purchased a better more substantial lunch from our hotel...we all received a very nice keepsake book from our most excellent driver, tour guide, and video:visual specialist, David Cohen. First of all, his driving was stellar, he gave us safety instructions, told and shared many wonderful stories, and was courteous to all on the bus---even changing exiting sometimes from last seats out first (very thoughtful). Beautiful day in one of our nations most majestic national parks! You will not stop to eat, you eat as you get hungry on the bus...DO NOT LITTER or FEED ANIMALS!We were the first pick up at our hotel, and only made one additional stop. At the end you can choose a hotel drop off or a Denali town experience drop off. A day that will be cherished in our minds for a long time.The tour takes place on an updated school bus, the typical large tour buses would tear up the roads that are gravelly.If going to Alaska this is a must do!","July 11, 2016",We saw lots of animals!,67,"Alpharetta, Georgia",5

What I didn't know was it would be in a packed school bus. We took the 10am shuttle expecting to return around 10pm. There were several stops (visitors centers and so on) but we only had a timed 15 minute break at these stops. A 30 minute break around 2pm for lunch. And 20 mins at Wonderlake. We had to eat on the bus in all locations except the main visitor center. The bus driver did narrate for us even though he didn't have to and stopped whenever we saw wildlife. The last several hours of the trip we were ready to get off and go home. The visitors center probably would have been enough.

Denali,Denali is one of a kind. The national park over there is magnificently run and well organised. The views and animal life are wonderful and you are taught how to behave yourself with animal encounters. An educational experience in itself. Will revisit if the opportunity arises. One word of advise. Stock on your groceries before arriving there if possible. A loaf of bread was costing us over 7 dollars. ,"July 10, 2016",Beautiful Denali ,2,,5
Denali,Denali was well worth the drive from Fairbanks. It's one of the few places I've seen in the world that really lives up to the hype. My only regret is that we didn't allow enough time to really see the park. We drove from Fairbanks for our visit and didn't allow enough time to take the bus into the interior of the park. I recommend staying near the park and spending a least a full day to really enjoy the park and the area. ,"July 10, 2016",I all I can say is WOW,12,"Woodbridge, Virginia",5

Denali,"We did the Denali Wilderness tour in the afternoon. The shuttle picked us up from the hotel porch on time, then headed out into the park. A tour is the best way to see the park (Besides hiking of course), as you can't drive very far into it. This was an eight hour tour, with stops every 1-2 hours. Lots of wildlife viewing. We saw moose, bears, caribou and Dall sheep. Bring binoculars. You might get lucky and some of the animals may come a bit closer, but most of them are likely to be far away. Views in the park are lovely. ","July 10, 2016",Beautiful tour!,50,,5

Denali,"Did the 12 hour bus trip and I mentally prepared myself for the old school bus you get the pleasure of driving in. The bus actually was not that bad, but really it's 2016 and this is the best transport they can come up with for the price you have to pay! The driver was very good with his knowledge and made a big effort to keep an eye out for wildlife, which is very scarce and a long way away. I worked out that there could be as many as 90 buses a day travelling along this road so no wonder the animals stay far away. The scenery is stunning and many photos will be taken. The lunch provided and the ""roadhouse"" at the end of the track is average at best and there is really nothing to do during the few hours you are there. So there is some good and bad it will just be the luck of the draw if you see any animals.","July 10, 2016","Stunning scenery, not much wildlife",88,Tanunda,4

Denali,"We had an awesome day going deep into the park with the Tundra Wilderness Tour. Don't let the idea of converted school busses scare you off. The seats are plush, individual seats like on a motor coach. The Naturalist/driver was knowledgeable. The PA system worked great - very understandable. The ride was long but broken up with plenty of rest stops (although they are all port-a-potties). The snack box provided is similar to an airplane snack box - ours had a beef sausage stick, hummus and chips, a little pot of cheese with a couple of crackers, a small bag of cookies, some trail-type mix and a fresh apple. Either eat a big breakfast or purchase a real box lunch from your hotel - because there is no other food or drink available until you return to your hotel 7-8 hours later! And bring along an extra bottle or two of water!We brought a bottle of champagne and some dollar store wine glasses to toast Denali. You are not allowed open containers on the bus, but you are allowed at the rest areas. So even tho it was a cloudy day, we popped the cork at the last rest area and toasted our trip to Alaska. After the bus headed back, about 10 minutes later, we spotted Denali peeking out of the clouds! What an awesome sight...the bus stopped and we all saw this magnificent sight for a few moments until the clouds covered it back up.

She was so knowledgeable about everything; there were no questions she could not answer. We saw several grizzlies and cubs, caribou, Dall sheep and ground squirrels and with the tv screens in the tour bus, we could see them up close. There were plenty of stops along the way for viewing and relief (although very rustic) but necessary for an 8 hour tour. The bus was comfortable and I was glad to not be driving on the narrow roads with drop-offs. The park's beauty is not to be missed. ","July 8, 2016",Magnificent,36,"Richmond, VA",5
Denali,"We signed up for the 17 mile 4-5 hour bus tour. It was a rainy day and the bus would not start. It took the bus driver several phone calls before a mechanic could get the bus started. Once on our way we stopped at the visitor center then on the road into the park. On the road again, we stopped several times for moose viewing. One cow had two calves within 30 feet of the road. As we were watching the moose some tourists, reading their cell phones nearly walked into the mother moose. However, a park worker nearby stopped his vehicle and quickly warned them about the animals just a few feet away. We stopped several more times for moose viewing. One of our stops was at Mountain Vista as Savage River was closed due to a bear incident. No bears, squirrels or any other wildlife except a few birds and the moose were seen. I'm sure the heavy rain in the area contributed to lack of wildlife. The scenery was fantastic, but due to rain and cloud cover we were not able to see Mt Denali. It was still a good trip and well worth our time. Unfortunately, due to the weather our trip lasted just a little over three hours","July 8, 2016",Lots of moose,56,"Helena, Montana",4

Denali,"Denali National Park is a place that I have always wanted to see. It was definitely well worth the drive from Anchorage and the numerous costs we had to pay to get there.Denali is huge and if you really wanted to get into the heart of the park you need to take a shuttle bus. We paid about $30 to catch a bus to Eielson Visitor Center (about 60+ miles into the park). While Eielson is nice it is nothing fancy, but the views of Denali (formerly Mt.McKinley) could not be beat.The shuttle ride was great. We read that the bus to Eielson was 8 hours round-trip so we brought stuff to read and things to do. They were unnecessary because there were occasional stops and our bus driver basically narrated throughout the ride . Our shuttle driver Craig was awesome. While he was not required to do so he taught us A LOT. He was very friendly, interesting, and told his passengers that he likes to educate (and he did). You will be very lucky if Craig is your shuttle bus driver. The park is gorgeous and all the stops made were worth getting off the bus. We were even fortunate to see Dall sheep, caribou, bears, and moose. I have never seen so many wild mammal wildlife in one place.The visitor center at the beginning of the park was very nice but the movie that they played there was quite boring (it wasn’t educational, it was just a bunch of stock footage of the park with no narration). Wish we skipped it.We only did one trail, the Horseshoe Lake Trail near the entrance of the park. It took about 1 ½ hours and was well worth it. You walk down to a lake, a river, and through a forest. We even got to see moose. Just be prepared that we ran into mosquitoes and those things are HUGE. Have never seen them that big before. There is a little incline on the way back to the parking lot but it is not that difficult.","July 7, 2016",Great Times at Denali National Park,158,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5

No souvenir shops or any place to buy anything. Because of this, you are more likely to see wildlife.

Denali,"If you like scenery and wildlife in the wilderness then this has to be on your list. We had planned to take the formal ""tour"" and waited off until the day before to book so that we could pick which of the 3 days we were there had the best weather. We were very disappointed to learn the night before our intended trip that there were no spaces left when we tried to book it online. We went along the next morning to the reservation desk to find that virtually everything is booked online in advance. We had intended booking the 12 hour Tour bus of Kantishna Experience - at $194 per person. We considered this a one off visit to the area and felt it was worth paying the extra for what was bound to be the better trip. We were however delighted the way things turned out as we took the only trip that was available that closely met our requirements which was the Shuttle Bus to Reflection Lake which was an 11.5 hour trip and at a cost of $51 per person. My experience of Shuttle Buses in National Parks is effectively a hop on hop off bus service, and although we did pick up one or two hikers along the way this was effectively a full day on the one bus. We were very fortunate to have Dale as our driver and guide for the day - who has been working in the park for 23 years and is extremely knowledgeable and happy to share this knowledge with us, we had lots of stops along the way to point things out, either when Dale noticed something or if one of the passengers did. From what I gather the formal ""Tour"" guides on the expensive buses are multi lingual and may do into more detail than some of the drivers. I certainly did not feel I missed out on anything with Dale as our driver - other than the one disappointment being we did not see any bears on this trip, bit we did see Denali - which we were told only about a third of the people entering the park actually get to see ""The Mountain"" due to the weather conditions.","July 6, 2016",A definite - don't miss it,96,"Glasgow, Scotland",5

Denali,"1st let me say that Denali is remarkable. No other place like it on earth. The vistas (on a SUNNY day) are mesmorizing. Our experience was not the typical I'm sure. This is just an opinion on how I wish I would have know what I was signing up for and would have been better prepared. The 1st day, the sun came out and we took the road trip 15 miles in ourselves, no big animal sightings except 2 baby moose. (will get back to that). Warning, do not pay the crazy amount they charge for the 8 hour tour on a cloudy day! You will not see the peak of Denali on that trip. Only if it's sunny. 4 hours would have been plenty. We did see a grizzly , moose and sheep. The animals are on their own schedule so no guarantees. Especially in the rain. The ""snack box"" box given tastes terrible...only thing worth eating was the beef jerky. Pack your own food!!! Be prepared to bring earplugs! For some reason , people think that bringing children under 3 is going to be fun for 8 hours...if you strap a toddler down for 8 hours, there will be meltdowns. There is no place to change dirty diapers, so you will smell it until you get to the next rest area which could be 1 and 1/2 hours away. Fun right? The tour guide loved his job, you could tell. However at the end, he made sure to let us know that the 2 baby orphaned moose whose mother was shot by humans will most likely get eaten by wolves. Nice things to tell kids. Good job. And by the way, shame to those in charge who are letting them starve to death and be sitting ducks for the ""food chain"". Humans caused their situation, don't you think we owe it to them to give them a shot in this world?! Call a wildlife conservation center! Seriously! I would visit Denali national park again, just wouldn't do the long bus tours.

Denali,"Amazing National Park! The park is huge - very expansive with sweeping mountain views and different types of tundra. Miles upon miles of hiking trails. The beauty of the Denali is just breathtaking. There are lots of animals, birds, and trees to observe, as well as wonderful places to just stop and take in all the beauty. The Junior Ranger program was great for my daughter to do, and the Rangers were informative and interesting to listen to.","July 2, 2016",Amazing!,29,"Pinehurst, North Carolina",5
Denali,"Wish we would have been able to spend more time here. We visited as part of a Princess land tour and a 5-6 hour natural history tour by bus was part of our schedule. There was an option to extend the tour up to 10 hours which we didn't do because we had a glacier landing flight scheduled for later that afternoon which was cancelled at the last minute due to strong wind. If you are a nature/wildlife lover, 5-6 hours is not enough time. Definitely choose to spend as much time as possible here...schedule a glacier landing flight from another city.

Denali,"Once again, it’s amazing how many people are crowding into these ‘remote’ areas. Since the highway was opened up between Anchorage and Fairbanks in the 70’s … this area is getting more and more popular all the time.We’d hoped to camp in one of their campgrounds inside the park, but it’s 100% reservation, so if you didn’t reserve ahead of time … you don’t camp there. Not many other places to camp close by … we found one in Cantwell which is about 27 miles south of the park and stayed there 2 nights.The park itself is HUGE and mostly wilderness. You can only drive 15 miles into the park on your own (29 miles if you’ve reserved at the Teklanika River Campground) and the rest is on busses.You must make your reservation for one of the bus shuttles or tours at the Wilderness Access Centre which is before the Visitor’s centre off the park highway. There are many shuttles going up the road and several stops you can choose to be your end point.**Note … don’t bother paying the big $$ to go on a ‘tour’. The shuttles are a fraction of the price … goes to the same places (only further) … sees the same sights … and our shuttle driver was so informative and funny there’s no reason to pay the big bucks if you don’t have to. (Some cruise or train packages automatically come with the ‘tour’ so you may not have a choice … but if you do … !!!)We chose to go to Eielson … the most popular stop as it’s the first you can really see the mountain for the least amount of $$. It’s an 8 hour round trip, but you can get off anywhere you want … or go to Eielson and stay there however long you want and take any other bus down. If you want to go down on the same bus you came up on that’s fine, but you only get ½ hour at Eielson which is barely enough time to snap a few photos! Unfortunately, with so many people taking the bus up, then hanging around for a few hours … all those bus fulls of people will be trying to get on later busses going down. We were concerned that we’d have to wait and – not wanting to get home at midnight – we opted to go back on the same bus. A bit of a flaw in the system … but I don’t know how else you could do it. There is a $10/pp fee for the park entrance, but you pay for that when/if you either camp or take a bus ride. No one checks and there’s no checkpoints to see if you’ve paid … so if you simply want to drive up your available 15 miles and drive back again … you really don’t need/have to pay the entrance fee.","July 1, 2016",Now THIS is Alaska!,201,"Victoria, Canada",5
Denali,"Took the Denali Tundra Tour, an 8 hour bus trip that goes about 55 miles into the park. We saw all the ""major"" animals except moose, which made for a nice experience. Great vistas all along the trip, altho Mt. Denali could not be seen. Note: when you take this expensive tour you sit on the bus in the same seat for the duration, which means if you board at an early pickup site (I think there are 3 total), then you get your choice of what's available, meaning the front of the bus. We boarded at the Wildlife Access Center, the last boarding site, and only had back of the bus seat options. The bus has several rest stops and passengers could have rotated seats had the driver required it but instead he thought differently. The back seats are bumpier than the front ones, have a more restricted view of what's coming, and are harder to access but, hey, the driver didn't care and evidently hadn't heard of bus seating customs in the old South.","June 30, 2016",Spectacular--and then some!,22,"California, USA",5

Denali,"Denali is simply too big to put into words. If you want to see the mountain in all its glory without being a serious hiker or mountain climber you have to take one of the shuttle buses into the park. Just make sure to take plenty of food and water because there is none on the 85 mile road. On this ride we saw some Dalls Sheep, a fox, snowshoe hares, and four grizzlies!Another option is to take a flightseeing tour, especially if you don't want to spend twelve hours on a bus with a bunch of strangers. It is expensive but it will leave you breathless... worth every penny!You can also get awesome views from the Parks Highway, especially from Denali State Park. On the day we went, the weather was awesome! Hardly a cloud in the sky. We heard that Denali is shrouded in clouds a third of the time because it makes its own weather. Our bus driver told us that to have full view of the mountains for the entire day is even more rare. Most people don't know this, but Denali is the taller than Mt. Everest. Everest is higher in elevation but its vertical rise from base to summit 15,000 ft.Denali has an 18,000 ft. rise!","June 29, 2016",Massive Mountain ,107,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Denali,"This is not a park for a casual visit. You will need to do your homework and invest a good chunk of time to get the most out of the park. The park is huge and travel times on the buses are longer than you may expect ( ex. 4 hours from the entrance to the Eileson Visitor Center). The buses are not glamorous, they are school buses refitted with propane engines and the bench seats replaced by two individual seats on each side.That being said, you can expect stunning vistas of boreal forest, open tundra and mountains during your visit. The backpacking opportunities are endless but you will need to secure a permit in one of the available units. As a general rule of thumb, Polychrome to Eileson units are the most sought out spots. All units are good though and will give you a true wilderness experience.Day hiking should be limited to the first 15 miles of the park to give you ample time to explore unless you are staying at Savage River or Igloo campgrounds already.Photos are from Unit 11.","June 28, 2016",A Visit Will Require Attention and Time,23,"North Vancouver, Canada",5

Denali,"Don't get me wrong...the scenery is breathtaking and if you are one of the lucky 30% - you actually get to see ""the mountain."" But, it is a LONG ride back to the overlook (like - over 2 hours) and there is one road in and one road out so you see the same views twice. For our party, our teenagers slept the whole way back out. Also, like I mentioned - only 30% of the visitors get a chance to view the summit of Denali. The rest of the time, it is covered in clouds. However, it is a national park in the best sense in that it is truly preserved in its wild state. You can tell there is a real respect for nature throughout the park.","June 28, 2016",Beautiful scenery,17,"Zephyrhills, Florida",4
Denali,"Our trip through the national park wasn't quite what we anticipated. Although it was beautiful and we saw a lot of wildlife, it was more like a bus tour rather than an exploration. Never being to Denali, we didn't know how massive it is and thought taking the shuttle to eillison, hiking around, and heading back in one day would be perfect. However, it seemed more like a tour than what we wanted. We had to keep the windows up because of dust (understandable, but made it very stuffy, even in the cool day we had). That, along with the diesel smell the dhole trip made the ride extra-long. The shuttle driver was very informative. We stopped three times for bathroom breaks, pictures, and short walks if desired (15 minutes max). By the time our four hour journey into the park was complete, we felt we were just ready to go back. We weren't positive on where to hike and not sure how the shuttle out of the park worked for sure do we opted to head back. I do know the super-nice and helpful staff would have been able to answer those questions, but after minimal sleep the night before and two plus hours back to Talkeetna, we were ready to head out. (We didn't go until 11:45, so maybe an earlier start in the park would've been better-go earlier! Or, after learning what we did while there, it sounds like walking the trails around the wilderness access center/visitor center and taking the shuttle to savage river campground and hiking the savage river trail was more what we were looking for.)Overall, it's an amazing place and very glad we went, but just be ready for a long day on a bus and know what you're getting into!","June 28, 2016","Beautiful park, but shuttle not what we expected",8,"Wausau, Wisconsin",4

The bus stops at a point from where Mount Mckinley can be observed, we were lucky to have a clear weather that day to have perfect views....The only downside is that we spent a lot of time on bus and lesser on the ground. Had to carry food and water, but that is obvious for any national park!Truly great experience. Fairbanks is just 2 hrs drive from Healy which is great for people who wants to visit there for the norther lights (fall time). Our parents enjoyed the stay and all the activities as well.

We ordered box lunches through our hotel, the kids rode free, and it was $35pp for my husband and me. Our shuttle driver, Nan, was super informative--I don't think a tour guide could have done better! She was great about telling us all about what we were seeing and stopping for wildlife sightings and so we could take photos of Denali (we were part of the lucky 30% of visitors that the mountain is ""out"" for) on our way. We saw a wolf (super rare sighting and very exciting), Dall Sheep in the distance, a mama grizzly and her cubs in the distance, and caribou. We did not see any moose on the tour, but did see one right on the side of the road on our way out of the park. You are given several rest stops, as well, on the shuttle tour, and have the option of getting off anywhere or staying longer at any stop and catching a different shuttle back to your starting point. Also of note, there is no park entrance fee for kids under 16, and the $10 per adult was included in our shuttle reservation, and is good for entry for 7 days, so we were able to go back a couple of days later and hike.

Please take time to watch the movie it's 18 minutes it's free and it really gives you an insight to the Four Seasons.And don't forget you get to go down and see the sled dogs.The shuttle bus to Wonder Lake $54 per person roundtrip I think there is reduced cost for children and remember if you're disabled you get a free park entrance fee in any national park but to enter our national park is $10 for 7 days.Give yourself and your children a treat and spend your time exploring this wonderful part because it never gets dark you can always be at a hotel watching TV you can't always enjoy the wonders of Denali.","June 19, 2016",The grandeur of of 5 other national parks all rolled into 600 million Acres,5,,5

My most recent visit to Denali was in June but anytime of year the sight is amazing.

Denali,"It's not easy to find words to describe the vastness of Denali National Park and all its wonders. It's worth doing some careful planning if you only have 2 or 3 days. The shuttle buses are an excellent choice if you want to explore on your own - but make sure you book in advance. There is only one road, that goes 90 miles into the park - but the park is 6 million acres - so you are only going to see a very small part of that vast expanse. Don't go in with the expectation of seeing large herds of caribou or moose - and bears are really hard to spot from the bus. Invest in a really good pair of binoculars if viewing wildlife is a priority - it's only natural that the animals keep their distance.What you will see, even without binoculars are some of the most spectacular vistas of mountains and forests that you can see anywhere - and that is worth it by itself. The real fun is the hiking that you can do - each of the trails has a slightly different character - so if you enjoy hiking, this is heaven.","June 17, 2016",Awesome!,9,"Oak Park, CA",5

I later learned few people actually get to see THE mountain because of weather conditions. However, it was not a disappointment because there is so much else to see. I saw moose, dall sheep and a grizzly bear. Honest. Super cool, especially for city slickers like me. The plant life and other mountain ranges were also very beautiful to experience. While the wildlife center is great, you will probably only see these things if you take a WILDLIFE TOUR INTO THE PARK. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and fun. In fact, everyone working at the park seemed to know their stuff and be passionate about it.The WILDLIFE CENTER is the hub. Definitely stop in for facts and information regarding the park and activities. The hiking trails are like no other. We took the trail directly behind the center leading past a train trestle, suspenion bridge and river. It was beautiful. You can go a couple of miles or you can climb a couple more up a switchback path on a MOUNTAIN. The further you go, the more strenuous it becomes. Not for the faint at heart. amazing views. It may be called Mckinley trail. Not sure.You can also take a FREE shuttle to a sled dog kennel at the park and learn all about their service and training.

Shy Timber wolves - - for us, anyway.Granted - - the majority of the Big Five (Moose, Caribou, Dall sheep, Timber wolves and/or Grizzlies) are not going to board your tour bus, shake your hand and bid you fare-thee-well, but WTH - - they are living in their element! Which means, ya dig out the binoculars, and deal with the fact that some of the aforementioned animals are not ""up close and personal"". Plus, it is a massive park. Did I say massive? Understated. Hopefully, your tour bus will enter the park at dawn/dusk when the animals are most active, searching for food/water/shelter. Ours did. And though it was not easy to ""rise and shine"" at the unfathomable hour of 6:15 a.m. after a long day of tours the prior day, it was well worth the effort. We were rewarded with the viewing of three of the five sans binoculars. Caribou traipsing down the road directly in front of us, and detouring into the brush to the right of us to dine on whatever it is that Caribou dine upon. Dall sheep ewes with their babies chowing down on the right of us. And high on the hillsides. A large bull Moose munching on willow branches down in the gully on the left of the bus.

Denali,"It was too early in the season to go very far into the park. We were only able to go in about 50 miles. We decided to take the park shuttle (green buses) since you could get off and on when you wanted and we were not particularly interested in a canned tour. It was also significantly cheaper. Our driver was Eldon Park (my apologies if misspelled.) He was quite an enthusiastic driver who had been on this job many years. His narration and descriptions of the park were certainly better than any canned tour. The park itself was one magnificent Vista after another. I would like to have seen more wildlife close up but can't complain. We did see moose, Dahl sheep and a couple of Grizzly bears as well as caribou. The Grizzlies were fairly far away so binoculars were helpful in getting a closer look. Next time we hope to be able to go further into the park. It is a fairly long journey with no food or water. Plan ahead! Get your food and water before arriving in the Denali park village.

The shuttle buses out of the Wilderness Access Center are the key to getting into the park (not the Visitor Center). We failed to anticipate the need to book reservations on the bus trips, but were fortunate to get on the 1pm Eielson Visitor Center trip. Knowing the wildlife is hit and miss, we struck gold. During the 8 hour round trip we saw nine grizzly bears, including a mother and cubs, countless caribou, dolly goats, golden eagles, and of course lots of squirrels. The tour was capped off with a sneak peak appearance of Denali during a brief break in the cloud cover. Truly a captivating experience for anyone drawn to the wilderness.We also took the Denali Village courtesy shuttle down tot he southern trailhead for the Triple Lakes Trail. Very enjoyable 9.5 mile trek back to the Visitor Center. Not much in the way of wildlife, though there was an abundance of moose droppings on the southern end of the ridge line.

Weather was slightly overcast but we still got a good view of the park's natural beauty. No Mount Denali though, but it's an environment the wildlife loves. We did see some caribou, a snowshoe hare, and couple of gulls mating on the roadside. We also had a nice stop at the Denali Visitor Center and watched their 20 minute video on the park's history and early pioneers.

Denali,"We have to admit that 4 days of sunshine can change a person's perspective when rating a national park like Denali. However, the way the Park is managed is excellent to experience in any weather. The Denali Visitors' Center is not to be missed and same goes for their Book Store (proceeds help support the Park). The Rangers we talked with were extremely helpful and well informed. Be sure and watch the 30 minute free movie offered at the Vistior's Center as the cinematography is very good. Visit the Park Kennels and learn all about the sled dogs used in the Park during the winter while witnessing a fun demonstration of their enthusiastic sled pulling! We used the Bus Shuttle service and it was very, very good! Craig who drove our bus was like having a Park Naturalist, Tour Guide and Back Country Ranger all in one (although the drivers are employees of Park's concessionaire). He made the 9 am to 3:30 pm trip to the Toklat River and back seem like just an hour or two it was so interesting. And, we saw lots of wildlife (grizzly sow and cubs, caribou, moose with calves, Mew Gulls, etc.). We joined the ""30% Club"" as were able to view and photographic Mount Denali many times - only 30% of the Park's visitors get this opportunity due to Denali essentially creating its own cloudy weather and obscuring it from view. All in all this is a very good National Park to visit as plan to go again. ","June 2, 2016",Beautiful Weather! Well Organized and Managed National Park!,37,"Bozeman, Montana",5

We found the trip up to Toklat and back very enjoyable due to and excellent ""transportation specialist"" (Craig). The views were spectacular as was the wildlife viewing. Due to the length of the trip, about 6 hours, I would not recommend taking young children.The second day we explored on our own, hiking and once again experiencing great wildlife viewing.

Denali,We thought this was a great time to visit the park. The weather was perfect for us. No mosquitos were out yet. The crowds were manageable and we saw lots of animals because the temps weren't too hot. The shuttle and tour bus situation was very confusing at first. If you go to the Wilderness Access Center they do a great job of explaining to you your options. We wish there were more hikes to take instead of being told to just go out and make your own trail.

Our tour guide/driver was brilliant, she was able to spot animals yet upkeep her eye on the road. We saw Bears, Caribou, Ground Squirrels, Dall Sheep and birds. Our tour lasted about 6 hours and we had enough comfort breaks including time to take photos. In the bus the driver had a camera that relayed the images to teh to screens to help us see the animals, such a great idea as we all did not have those fantastic zoom lenses.Not only fabulous for the animals but the spectacular views, 6 million acres of a beautiful park.","May 24, 2016",Increadible,181,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",5

It makes it better when you actually see the attraction. Our tour guide was knowledgeable, fun and accommodating. He was great about stopping when there was wildlife and pointing it out.

But the scenery was still great and we saw moose, caribou, a grizzly bear with 2 cubs, and a couple of herds of Dall sheep. If you have more time and want to hike, the park has buses you can get on/off during the day on the same road as the wilderness tour buses; we didn't have time but maybe next trip. All the buses are like school buses. The wilderness tour stops regularly at comfort facilities where you can also take pictures off the bus and also a least one scenic only stop. The bus stopped when someone spotted wildlife but you can't get out (pictures through the window, ideally an open one if the neighbors are friendly, otherwise the windows may be dirty as they were on our rainy day on the dirty stone road).

I had read this many times on Internet and Books , But when i saw this with my own eyes , my eyes just popped out in awe. It's hugeeeeee. I have not seen such a massive mountain which dwarfs its surroundings. As an average only 30 % of tourists who visit Denali National Park are actually able to see the great one , becuase it is mostly covered with Clouds. I was not able to see it , so decided to Hop on a Glacier Landing Airplane and Landed on one of the Glaciers of Denali. It was as close to heaven as one can get. Pristine Nature and Glaciers untouched by mankind. i felt extremely lucky to have witnessed Mt Denali from so up close.

If you have a national park in your backwoods, you may want to skip Denali.","November 25, 2015",Didn't see a single animal,95,"Boulder, Colorado",1
Denali,"We didn't make it into the 30% club of people who see the mountain in all its glory, but we still loved Denali and thought it was one of the most spectacular parks we've ever been to. The national parks in Alaska are so different than the ones in the lower 48 - they feel so remote and undeveloped and like you're really getting away and into nature. I love Yosemite as much as the next person, but sometimes it feels like you're at Disneyland there and Denali is the complete opposite. Although Denali is one of the few Alaska national parks that can be accessed by car, you can only take your car 15 miles into the park and after that you have to take a shuttle bus. We took the shuttle bus all the way to Wonder Lake (mile 85), but if you want to save time or money, you can just go to Eielson Visitor Center (mile 66). The best views (at least when Denali is not out) are pre-Eielson. And Wonder Lake itself has more mosquitoes than any place I've ever been - I didn't actually get many bites but the air is absolutely thick with them. The NPS website indicates that the shuttle bus is unguided and you can pay a bit more to take a guided tour bus, but I was really impressed with our shuttle bus drivers (we had two, because on the way back we got off at Eielson, did a little hiking and caught a later bus). Both of them, but especially our first driver, Mike, were very good about spotting and stopping for wildlife and had very entertaining personalities. I can't imagine what we would have gotten on a guided tour that we didn't get on the shuttle bus, except a boxed lunch (which is easily arranged through your hotel).Denali is famous for having tons of wildlife, and many people refer to it as an American safari experience. We saw 4 of the ""Denali Big Five"": caribou (about 50 times - seriously, if you can go here and NOT see a caribou, I'll be very impressed), moose, grizzly bears and Dall sheep - only the wolf eluded us. Of course the longer you spend on the shuttle bus, the more chance you have of seeing wildlife, but there's a lot to be seen in the first 15 miles too. Our first day there we drove into the park and saw a moose right alongside the road. If you plan on coming for the wildlife and the beautiful vistas of the Alaska range and consider seeing Denali itself the icing on the cake, you will leave more than satisfied. It's only the people that come here thinking the tallest mountain in N. America is the only thing to see here that leave disappointed.More details and photos here: destinationsanddesserts.com/2015/11/16/american-safari-denali","November 18, 2015",Wildlife and panoramic vistas well worth it even if you don't see Denali itself,105,Indiana,5
Denali,"But we did not see Mt. McKinley once in the week we were in Alaska, whether from Cook's Inlet in Ancorage, enroute to Denali Nat'l Park or leaving the park due to the previous smoke from forest fires and then cloud cover from the pouring rain for 5 days straight...but the Alaskan Huskies were worth the visit. The bus ride up to Eilsen Visitors Centre was not! We saw some elk in the mist and low lying clouds on the way up but could not see 2 feet outside the visitor's centre when we arrived after a very long uneventful bus ride, ate our packed lunch and took the same bus back down right away. There was nothing at the visitors center to do other than hike, which was not possible. We saw a lot more wildlife in one day in Banff National Park driving along the hwy than we saw in a week in Alaska hiking mountains, atving trails, walking paths, and sitting outside a remote cabin in Denali...The Alpine Peak Trail was strenuous and worth the time, even in the rain.","November 16, 2015",It may have been the rain...,97,"Toronto, Ontario",3
Denali,"You really have to visit Denali National Park to get a real impression of the landscape in this area. It is constantly changing and quite spectacular. We were lucky enough to see quite a few animals on our day in the park. The bus driver has been extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He really made sure everyone got the opportunity to take a picture of every animal we saw on the way and had quite a few stories to tell. You spend basically the majority of the day in the bus, with a few occasional stops but it's really worth it.","November 14, 2015",Animal viewing and spectacular scenery,30,"Toulouse, France",5
Denali,"We made a special trip to Denali to see the National Park during our 2 weeks vacation in Alaska in late August. We stayed in a cabin about 25 minutes from the park and booked our Wilderness tour for the 1st slot in the morning. We got our tickets on line and for 7 am, there was not too many visitors yet.However, Denali had a snow storm tge night before. We were there in August and it was snowing that morning when we came in! The bus your was delayed since the roads needed to be plowed. there was some confusion about whether they will open the park or close some sections of it due to the weather. Two hours later, we we able to go on the bus and start our tour.We saw many wildlife in their natural habitat ie bears, moose, caribous, mountain sheep, American eagles, etc..Fall colors were just beginning to blanket the valley in bright hues of reds and yellow against the backdrop of snow capped mountains and pastures! Spectacular! However due to the weather, we did not make it all the way to Wonder Lake. We waiting for over an hour in Toklat and then had to turn around because the road was treacherous. Although we were disappointed not to make it all the way to end of our tour, we saw a lot. And the Park promptly refunded us.TIPS: bring binoculars, snacks, light lunch, and bottled water. Check the weather before going and dress accordingly. Wear sensible shoes. Hiking boots or sneakers are practical.On your bus ride, stay towards the back or next to a window so you can see wild life and take their pictures easily.Follow instructions of your driver, particularly when you see wild life close to your bus. Be respectful. The drivers are there to protect you and their resources. And be prepared to be amazed! And experience Alaska in its untamed environment. It is indeed one of our most memorable trip!","November 2, 2015",Highly recommended... be prepared for bad weather,66,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4

Bears, Moose, Dahl Sheep, Ptarmigan, spruce grouse, Sandhill Cranes. A great deal of the wildlife very up close, good photography opportunities. Was well worth the trip for the wildlife alone.

We were fortunate to visit when the trees were changing colors and the first traces of new snow arrived. I traveled light: one camera with a zoom lens. We were on a tundra bus tour, so many shots were grab out the window and a tripod would not work. Use high ISO, lens stabilzation and don't just wait for a stop. When you do stop, work the mountains. We had a peek-a-boo experience with Denali. Clouds added to the scenic interest.","October 20, 2015",Photographers Heaven,535,"Seattle, Washington",5
Denali,"Denali, like so many of the national parks, is such an amazing place. We were lucky to visit in early September when leaves were starting to change and there had already been an early snow on the mountains. It was cool enough that the mosquitos were gone but the weather was pretty clear. You can drive your car only so far into the park so we took the Tundra Wilderness Tour bus option that was around 7 hrs long. The bus stopped for wildlife sitings so the passengers could get photos. They didn't stop for many of the scenic photo ops which would have been nice, so you had to hope that animals showed up when the scenery photo ops came into view. Denali is beautiful and the scenery has a lot of variety. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Alaska, a minimum of 2 days.

We thought the bus ride into the interior was going to be tedious, but it turned out to be a true adventure in wildlife viewing. Make your bus reservation as soon as you can. The only downer is that Alaska rips up the roads every summer to re-pave them. In the land of the mid-night sun, you would think that they could do road work at night. There were 4 construction sites between the park and the campground where we stayed. It took between 30 and 60 minutes to travel the 6 miles each way.

Denali,"We visited Denali three years ago and took the bus tour. It was a nasty day and our driver was horrible. He didn't stop talking for 8 hours and rarely mentioned the park.. We decided to give the park another chance. This time we did the 15 mile self drive into the park at least 2-3 times each of the 3 days we were there. Denali was open the whole time YAY!!! and we got fabulous pics each day. We only saw moose each day, no bear etc, but moose up close one morning. That and the fall scenery made it an excellent visit!! So if you drive the first scenic 15 miles you will see fantastic color and mountain settings. Funny, when you look for wildlife there is no need to search them out. Just look for cars and photographers with the long lenses and you will find wildlife!! Our opinion of the Park is significantly better now that we did the drive ourselves. Nothing against the buses but less flexability in how long you stop. Well worth the visit!!!

He said that particular day was one of only 5 a year with no wind, no clouds and glorious sunshine. A perfect day to fly. We were able to take in McKinley up close and personal which was aweinpiring. That said, the mountain is so damn big that you don't have to fly to appreciate its magnificence. You can see it from at the edge of the park, you can see it from one of the magnificent hotels in Talkeetna or even on the way to Fairbanks. That said, if you get that close, and the sun is shining, you should jump on the chance to head all the way into the park by bus or plane to get that much closer to it.

We saw bear, caribou, moose, Dall sheep, and plenty of smaller things.Caveat - and this can be a big downer but what can you do? - we were there on a rainy day (it was beautiful on the way up the day before) and everything was mud. The windows of the buses were all covered with mud and you couldn't see anything unless you opened them. And it was cold enough that you would not want to just leave them open. So we all tried to clear the windows by any means available at each rest stop, but they were covered again within five minutes of driving. Most of the road is unpaved and muddy.The operatiors are at the mercy of the weather, obviously, but I think they could improve the ability to wipe the windows at the rest stops. There were a few squeegies going around but nothing to dip them in but buckets of very muddy water.There were no views to be had upwards of any of the mountains, everything was shrouded in clouds and fog.SO this was just our bad luck, we still enjoyed the trip but you should be aware that it can go down this way and try not to be too disappointed if it does.","September 22, 2015",Shuttle bus mixed bag,11,"Rockport, Maine",3

The scenery is gorgeous and we saw 3 grizzly bears, a moose, 2 dall sheep in the distance and a lot of caribou. The bus driver/tour guide searches for wildlife and stops and points it out and gives everyone long enough to take photos. We lucked out and had a beautiful sunny day so we got to see part of Mt McKinley (now Denali). It was spectacular to see, even if it is way off in the distance. At the beginning of the tour they provide you with a box of snacks. It included various packs of crackers, chips, cheese dip, beef stick, etc. and bottles of water. If you want more than that to eat in the 8 hours you better bring something with you as there isn't anywhere in the park to get food. They did make 3 bathroom stops along the route and a couple other stops to get out and look at the scenery, so there's plenty of time to stretch your legs. The tours are all in old school buses, so it isn't the most comfortable ride, but the scenery makes up for it and the excitement when you see animals. Definitely worth taking the trip.

We took a 5+ hour bus tour of the preserve and, thankfully, had wonderful weather. Automobiles aren't allowed in the preserve during regular hours so one must take one of the National Park buses which is a good idea; however, if your bus is crowded (like ours), getting views of the wildlife can be challenging. There are buses that one can take which will stop and let you off to either hike around or catch another, later, bus which might be a better option (we were on a pre-arranged tour). We did see grizzlies, caribou, moose (in the distance) and beautiful, drop-dead scenery. Plus, Denali only had a few clouds on it so we had pretty good views.

Denali,We spent two weeks in Alaska and this was the best part of the trip. Everything about the park is spectacular and the staff works very hard to ensure you have a terrific visit . They are also very safety conscience on the bus tours. We took the tour that goes 60 miles into the park and had two snow delays due to the amount of accumulation at the higher elevations. Even the snow was beautiful and added to our experience in this place beautiful beyond words.the drivers do a masterful job of helping spot wildlife and explain about them when sited. They also make sure you get to make as many pictures as you wish.,"September 15, 2015",Put This On Top of Your List,31,Atlanta,5
Denali,"Going thru the park was a magnificent experience. We saw many animals, and our guide was very knowledgable about the parkl. It was a full day event, and well worth the time. We saw Mt McKinley 2 days in a row. What a majestic site. .","September 14, 2015",Wonderful bus adventure.,0,"Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania",5
Denali,"Denali's landscape is awesome and empty from the bus along the road and on day hikes from the lodges past Wonder Lake. We only sampled the edge of the true wilderness, however, since we did not hike with backpacks and camp overnight.","September 13, 2015","Vast, dramatic landscapes; awesome exposure to wilderness; however, access is limited unless you backpack",9,"San Francisco, California",4
Denali,"Denali is a truly huge mountain, and you have to see it to understand how impressive it is. Unfortunately, seeing it--at least, seeing most of the mountain all at one time, top to bottom--depends on a lot of luck. We were here in 1999, and were tremendously lucky because the mountain was out (in full view) for more than a day while we were in Talkeetna. This year, the mountain did not come out during our entire time when we were in viewing range, except for brief periods when portions were visible. We saw the peak at one time, but most of the mountain was shrouded in clouds. That's just the way it is; you just have to be lucky. But in my opinion, it is well worth coming to Denali or Talkeetna or other places like that, because the payoff is huge is you do get lucky. (And if you don't, there are plenty of other things to do.) Staying several days instead of just passing through can improve your chances but still does not guarantee success.We also took a K2 flight out of Talkeetna hoping to see the mountain, but not even that was successful in providing more that peeks at parts of the mountain. But we saw enough other stuff, like glaciers, to make the flight worthwhile.","September 13, 2015","Stunning, provided you can see it",610,"DeWitt, New York",5
Denali,"We were fortunate enough to see the mountain when we arrived at Eielson visitor’s center via the National Park Shuttle bus. The entire trip to the center was very over-cast and cloudy but the clouds dispersed after we arrived at the center and the entire Mt. McKinley was visible, but only for about 10 minutes. It is well worth the trip even if you don’t get a view of the mountain. We saw bears, a wolf, and sheep and took many beautiful pictures of the Alaskan landscape. The driver was very informative and helpful. Bring a box lunch, snacks and water for the trip. There was a two hour departure delay for all the busses from the Wilderness Access Center due to snow, a rarity in Denali NP before the suspension of shuttle bus service the second week after Labor Day. It’s a full day excursion so dress in layers. We were there in September so there was no bug problem but I understand that bugs could be a problem earlier in the season. A trip to the visitor’s center at the park entrance and a chat with the park rangers would be helpful.","September 13, 2015","Mt. McKinley ""what a sight""",115,"New Brunswick, New Jersey",5
Denali,"Everywhere we went over Alaska, we kept saying it just couldn't get any better, and it always did. Denali was our final destination, the first week of Sept. Fall had arrived and we got there right after an arctic blast came through and dumped up to 6 inches of snow. Imagine golden Aspen Trees and sparkling snow-topped mountains, and on our two touring days - gorgeous blue skies. It just doesn't get any better than that. We saw Denali, the Mountain, from every possible vantage point, both from the Talkeetna side, and along the drive to the Park side, as well as our two days inside the Park. The first day we took our car to the 15-mile point where you have to turn around. Only shuttle and tour buses are allowed beyond. But that 15 miles is incredible. Highly recommend taking a short hike up to Savage Rock, at the Savage River Turnaround point. Views are worth it.  Also recommend taking a tour bus, although the shuttle buses are run by the Park Service and are free. We took the 12 hour tour that went to the end of the road in Denali, although I have to say, that the one that goes to mile 62 really is enough. Most of the incredible views and scenery are in that section, as well as wildlife. But we did enjoy the walk with a Ranger and the history he provided. Wildlife viewing is GOING to happen, but most are not close to the road, so take binoculars or a zoom lens for your camera. Polarizer filter highly recommended if it's sunny. Sitting on the Left side of the bus is best, from a sun perspective, but both sides get turns viewing wildlife as it works out. And folks share their windows :-).","September 12, 2015","No one can really prepare you for Denali on a clear, sunny day!",30,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Denali,"Now it is officially Denali. The Visitors Center can not be missed. The Bus wilderness tour is a must if you are not driving. Never saw the mountain. Clouds keep us from ever seeing all the mountain at one time over the three days we were there. If you don't take a tour I doubt you will spot the wildlife. It is a wilderness adventure for the young and hardy, best seen by hikers and campers. Not really worth the 8 hour bus ride just to see a few animals that are 300 yds away. To see bears hunting salmon go on a river tour when the fish are traveling up stream. Or take the plane ride that flies around Denali.

The views on the way are amazing, the park is beautiful. We were lucky to see several grizzly bears, caribou, moose and dall sheep. When we arrived at the Eielson Visitors centre we were so pleased to be able to see the mountain. At the start of our journey it was cloudy and it looked like we wouldn't be seeing it, we did appreciate that it is a 30% chance of seeing the mountain. We were some of the lucky ones!

But, We were very lucky with the weather. It was sunny and the mountain was clearly visible all along the road. You will get a very good view of the mountain from its base as we get near to the Eielson visitor center.

The buses look on the outside like school buses, but are comfortable inside. Our driver/guide was very personable, knowledgeable, and fun. The changing varied landscape is incredible. We got good views of moose, grizzly bears, Dall sheep, and caribou as well as some smaller wildlife. The snack provided was plenty for us -- no need to buy a lunch separately.It is seven hours on a bus with bathroom stops and only one stop for just walking around. I would have loved somewhere that we could have walked a half mile or so into the wilderness, but I guess it is too hard to round everyone up if you let them go like that.","September 11, 2015",Incredible beauty,100,"Athens, Georgia",5

Denali,"We spent 5 days and 4 nights in Denali National Park (at North Face Lodge) The first 3 days were rainy and there was no view of the mountain. In fact it was hard to visualize where the mountain would be because there is nothing like this in the continental US. In order to see the mountain up at 22000 feet there must be miles of clear sky horiztonally and vertically. The guests were starting to worry that we would never see it. On the 3rd evening the sky started to clear and there were intermittent glimpses of parts of Denali. By the 4th and 5th days the sky was so clear showing Denali in all its glory that it was worth the wait. I think I would have been sorely disappointed not seeing it. The Eielson Park Cetner states that only 1/3 of visitors ever see the mountain. I think these statistics are misleading in that the chances of seeing it increase the longer you stay, for obvious reasons. If you are only making one visit, to increase your chances of seeing Denali, I would plan several days to make sure you don't miss it. While Alaska is beautiful without seeing Denali, it's the icing on the cake. As one of the guests said when Denali came into view, Denali alone is worth the trip. The weather says there's a 50% chance of rain in August.","September 7, 2015",Worth the wait,318,"Westwood, Massachusetts",5

Either way, it was stunning. Took the bus to Wonder Lake. Well worth the price and the only way to see the park.

Mount McKinley (and now officially renamed Denali) is often not fully visible to visitors, particularly if they are only in the area for a day or two. The mountain ""makes"" its own weather and thus is often shrouded in clouds. Given the length of our visit, we were treated to full views of Denali from both the north and south as well as air flights in small bush planes that flew around the mountain and one that landed us on Ruth Glacier. It is true that this mountain and the Alaska Range are best appreciated via the air, but however you have the opportunity to experience Denali (""The High One""), North America's highest peak, it is clearly a magnificent sight to behold.","September 3, 2015",The Jewel of the Alaska Mountain Range,237,"San Francisco, California",5

This is not a park over-run by tourists, scaring away everything but the squirrels! Enjoy the wildness of it, but don't be naive.

Incredible! Our shuttle driver, Elton, was a wealth of knowledge about the park and you could tell he truly appreciated the beauty of this amazing place. The shuttle is great because you can get off if you want to hike and catch another shuttle back. You may have to wait a bit, depending on your return time but they'll get you back.

It is a must to see while in Alaska. Given that the mountain is so large and has it's own weather, it is hard to get a view of it on a clear day.

We saw imposing moose, caribou, large grizzlies, American Bald Eagles, Dall Sheep, and squirrels. I highly recommend at a minimum the 8 hour shuttle to the Eielson visitors center. There are longer tours and shuttles, and in my opinion the longer the better. The shuttles are not considered tours, but the bus driver stops whenever wildlife are seen and they answer all questions concerning the park and the wildlife. We stopped at several well sited rest stops for bathroom breaks, approximately every 60-75 min. THERE IS NO FOOD AVAILABLE EXCEPT AT THE VISITORS CENTER! YOU MUST BRING YOUR LUNCH AND SNACKS OR GO HUNGRY! There are water fountains and water bottle refill stations available at the rest stops. Denali National Park restricts vehicle access so the way to see the park is by tour bus or shuttle.

We saw grizzly and brown bears, lots of caribou and moose and Dahl sheep from a great distance. You can get on and off the bus where ever you want but the hiking further in the park is mostly on the side of the road or trails that you make. At some of the stops there are a few trails. You need to take plenty of food and water with you as food is not available once inside the park. The best hiking is at the entrance where you do not need to take the bus. Seeing Mt.

The wildlife in the park is fantastic-I saw moose, caribou, grizzlies, foxes, and golden eagles. I enjoyed the varied terrain-boreal forest, tiaga and tundra. The rivers were beautiful, as was the polychrome section. I honestly forgot that I was disappointed not to see the mountain. The hiking is varied and can be structured on trails or just off into the wilderness. The sled dog demonstration is a must.

We took a picnic lunch with us to eat at the visitor's center. You are able to get on and off the bus pretty much anywhere you wanted. You could go hiking and when you got tired you could start walking along the road in the direction you wanted to go and flag down any green shuttle bus.

Take advantage of the opportunity that suits your adventurous spirit. We chose the fixed wing plane and were fortunate to go up to 20,000 feet almost to the summit. It was breath taking and the best experience of our entire trip. While in the area, keep your eyes out for wildlife - we saw a Mama Moose and her baby calf nursing, many caribou, Ravens, a wolf, Dahl sheep, Eagles, just incredible.

We were able to see it from the north, south, inside the park, and by small airplane to view the entire mountain up to the summit. Besides this we were able to see it from the airline to Fairbanks, on the train to Denali National Park, from our lodge in the Talkeetna area, and on the bus leaving the area. This was an unforgettable series of experiences to view the most awesome mountain I've ever seen. (and I've lived all my life in Utah and Colorado where we have some really nice mountains!!) . The whole Alaska Range is made up of large, impressive, beautiful mountains, but Denali dwarfs them all, rising up to 20,320 feet from the surrounding area which is 1700-3900 ft in elevation.Words are inadequate to describe the beauty and majesty of the mountain, and a picture does not reflect its imposing presence and enormity.

Driving from anchorage at mile marker 135 there is a signposted viewpoint that has brilliant views of the south side of Mt McKinley and Mt foraker (not sure if this is open during some of the roadworks but there is a road turning about half a mile further with road work vehicles in that also has the same view). Then from savage river in denali national park is a good view on a clear day but it is quite far away. You can drive to savage river or take the free shuttle from the visitors centre.

Denali,"Spectacular time at this park - the trip of a lifetime!Late August 2014 rented car Fairbanks and drove to Denali. I got a 3 night stay reserved at Teklanika (Tek) campground, about 15 miles past where pavement ends. We were forewarned that we likely might not see Mt McKinley so wanted 3 nights to allow best chance. This campground had many good points, among them the right to drive car to campground and leave in your car (no driving inbetween though - must use camp buses when going either direction on the road). were able to get reservation for bus to Wonder Lake early the morning after first night stay (made when I checked in for first night!), can use the buses as much as we wanted room available (which was not a problem when I went) for one fee (about $60), not many mosquitoes at our tent site (although there were some). We did some hiking here but this is not the most scenic campground site. Arrived about 2:15pm, set up tents, caught a camp bus to Eleison VisCenter. The bus stopped at all the stop points on Denali road long enough to take some pictures of the scenery. This bus stopped at Polychrome Pass long enought to hike to the top of hill above the road with great views (but very windy). I saw lots of wildlife (mostly caribou and a few griz and a few dall sheep). We saw the wolfpack on the way back (bus stopped about 30 minutes to watch them go up all the way to top of yonder hills). Bus would always stop when wildlife was spotted. I did not see Mt Denali except for the very top of the North face peak from the road when close to Eleison, but thankful for at least that my first time out. I would have liked to climb to top of hill above Eleison VC, but was concerned about whether I would get back in time for the last return bus. At Eleison the trail down into the valley was closed for bear sighting. I got a decent pic of the bear with 18x magnification close to the trail. Trip back was less eventful other than the sighting of the wolfpack.The 2nd day my sis and I got to bus stop for reservation to Wonder Lake bus about 7am. The bus was about 40 minutes late, but evidently that happens sometimes. We were on our way with hopefully better views today of the mountain. On the way, we saw best views of grizz, a sow and 2 cubs we watched for 20 minutes or so coming down the hill (with 2 other buses who had stopped), stopping to eat along the way and finally passing right under my open bus window for some great camera shots (bus driver said to be very very quiet as they passed by the bus on the way to opposite side of the road and more vegetation. While at Eleison I hiked the trail down into the valley for some great views of Denali. I could see most of Denali but most of the top was shrouded in clouds We had seen our 1st views of Denali a few miles before Eleison but it was even more shrouded than at Eleison - still a feeling of awe at magnificence from as much as I could see rising above the lower elevation 15000 feet or more! Because of my hike, we had to get on another bus (our initial bus only waited about 20 minutes or so - they tell you how long before leaving when they let you off) to continue on to Wonder Lake. We saw many beautiful sights and some more wildlife on the way to Wonder Lake. As we got closer we got some better views of Denali! At Wonder Lake turnoff, we were given the option to hike 1 1/2 miles to Reflection Pond (which sis and I chose to do). We were seeing some great views of Denali as we walked. At Reflection Pond, there was too much wind and water movement for any reflection of Denali in the pond, but it was still beautiful! We walked back, then had to walk down the cutoff road to Wonder Lake bus stop (about a mile maybe - so about 4 miles total but not too steep any of it). We were getting some of best pics ever of Mt Denali on our hike down to Wonder Lake, as it continued to clear little by little during the day. The mosquitoes were really bad at many spots at Wonder Lake area unless I kept moving. We were concerned about getting back as it was getting late, so caught the first bus we could back, without going to the edge of Wonder lake. We saw even better views of Mt Denali on the trip back to Eielson. At Eielson we got our best shots of the mountain, in full view we thought. We were sure to watch the time and catch the same bus back to Tek as were not sure if another would be coming. After internet research, I'm thinking that you can only see the North face peak from Wonder Lake, which we got great pics of. But from Eleison, it appears now to me that we did not get a full clear view of the North and higher South peaks, just the N peak. On 1 or 2 of our shots, we can see the shadow of the shape of the S peak behind some cloud up front! All shots were magnificent to us as this was our 1st time to mainland AK. The 3rd day we decided to leave (a day early - the campsite cost / night was only $20 and we had seen some great views of the mountain and had so many other things to see in AK during our 3 week stay. We drove our rental car out, stopped a few miles before Savage river (where pavement ends) for lunch and great views (much different than what we had seen before). Here the South peak was shrouded in cloud, but the N peak looked uniquely different from this viewpoint. We did a nice hike along the Savage river and then exited the park. Our 1st day we enjoyed seeing the main Visitor Center and the dog sledding show. After leaving the NPark, we headed toward Wasilla for the evening with friends. We stopped at the N view of Denali state park and saw the clouds clear for some great views of Denali S peak from the south side (you're seeing it from the north from the NP road). But by time we stopped at S view of Denali state park, we could not see any of the mountain. Ditto (no view at all) from the banks of the river in Talkeetna, AK. We were truly blessed to see as much of the mountain as we did, some for each of 3 days we were there. A Ranger told us that no one had seen any of the mountain for about 2 weeks before we arrived! The trip to Denali was the trip of a lifetime for sis and I!There is no food for purchase once past the main Visitor Center. You will need to bring everything you need for your stay with you. The ground was hard at our Tek campsite for tent stakes.

Denali,"DENALI-THE GRAT ONE ( MOUNT McKINLEY) FLIGHT OF FANCY-MOUNT McKINLEY UP-CLOSE  (ALASKA’S HIDDEN BYWAYS I) Over the years, we have visited about 40 National Parks and numerous National Monuments, but the two-three hours spent in and around the Alaska Range and Mount McKinley, both from the air, and on a glacier, ranks as one of the greatest thrills of our travels. Not only did we get up close and personal with these inspiring peaks, but they put the world and our very being into an interesting perspective. The feeling that we carried away from this aerial expedition was that “NATURE WILL WIN”. Our trips, which I plan out, are flexible expeditions involving planning and coordination. Tour ships are not our thing, and neither is camping. Therefore, lodges, rental cars, and special pre-arranged activities (i.e. back-country flights, rafts, bear viewing trips, etc.) are planned months in advance, as well as the route taken.  What was the process to set things up? We had flown over the Wrangell-St. Elias Mountains four years earlier with Wrangell Mountain Air, out of McCarthy, AK, so we were familiar with the type of air operation that fit our needs. A little research brought us to TALKEETNA AIR TAXI (TAT), operating out of Talkeetna, AK. A few telephone calls later found us booked on a Cessna single engine aircraft for a specific date in July. This firm (TAT) came highly recommended and has participated in many expeditions in the Alaska Range and Mount McKinley. In addition, they will pick you up from your hotel and return you there after the adventure. With the date and flight set, we needed accommodations near the Talkeetna airport. We decided on the Talkeetna Alaska Lodge, which proved to be a wonderful base of operations. This is a world class Lodge with beautifully appointed rooms, excellent food and services, and an ideal location. We booked this at least 8-9 months in advance of the trip, once the flight into the Alaska Range was finalized (deposit required). Once this section of our trip was set, I built the rest of the trip around it. This involved a visit to Cordova, AK, Denali National Park, the Ayleska Resort, Homer, and Brooks Lodge in Katmai National Parks. These areas will be discussed in other TripAdvisor submissions. One of the principle problems in setting up a flight like this is the Alaskan Weather. The Alaska Range rises abruptly from the northern Pacific Ocean/Bering Strait area and has a tendency to have radical shifts in weather. This can occur very rapidly, so windows of opportunity may not be frequent. For flight seeing and glacier landings, good weather is essential. A back-up date is advisable, as long as it fits into your schedule and is arranged with Talkeetna Air Taxi, or an equivalent service. Some prayers to the weather gods may also help.  When we arrived in Talkeetna, AK, the day before the flight, the weather was great and the Mountains were visible. The reason for this statement was that on our previous visit to Denali National Park four years earlier, we were told that Mount McKinley had not been visible for 14 days, and we had lucked out. We checked in to both the lodge and Talkeetna Air Taxi, and were informed that we were “GO” for our flight on the next day. We also spent some time wandering, and photographing, the beautiful lodge grounds.  A few words about high mountain photography; I was using a digital SLR Nikon Camera. I set the camera for the maximum number of pixels/frame and used an 18mm – 105mm zoom lens. I also decided to run the camera on shutter priority, with an ISO setting of 125. I also used a backed off Polarizer to help reduce the snow glare. I used a new SD card and carrier a spare card and battery in the event that they were needed (they were not needed).  We were picked up at about 8:30AM from our lodge and taken to the Talkeetna Air Taxi (TAT) office in order to fill out the necessary paper work and pay the tariff (i.e. cost about $1100.00 US) for the exclusive use of the Cessna and pilot (Bill P.). We have found, due to our extensive photographic requirements and special requests, to book items such as small planes for our party ONLY. It does avoid crowding and disagreements, since my wife and I usually agree on our program. In addition, use the bathroom facilities before departing. The mountains are cold.We also brought heavy clothing, gloves, and hats. We were told that a simple sweatshirt should suffice. We were also told to don glacier boots, since we would be walking on a glacier. A pair of sunglasses is essential due to the sun glare on ice.  I sat in the front next to the pilot, while my wife occupied the rear seat. I discussed my mental image of what I wanted to see and photograph with the pilot (Bill P.). I have found that this is helpful in many different occasions since the pilot is very familiar with the terrain and can safely get you, and your camera, into the correct position and photographic angle.  We took off from the Talkeetna airport, passed over the scrub forest and into the Front Range of the Alaska Range. The first few minutes of this flight was not impressive, until the hint of blue ahead of us resolved into the true Alaska Range. The enormity of the scene made us gasp, even though we had been in many areas of “Glaciated Mountains”. As we passes over the KAHILTNA GLACIER, we saw, and photographed, Mount Crosson and on one side, while the bulk of MOUNT McKINLEY (20320 ft) occupied the other (see images). We continued to gain altitude as we began our circumvention of Mount McKinley, with the famous West Buttress coming into view (see images). The West Buttress climbing route was pioneered by Bradford Washburn and is still the preferred route of climbers of this mountain.  As we swung around the mountain, the Wickersham Wall, the steepest side of Mount McKinley, occupied one side of our Cessna, while the other side opened up with a view of the Upper Kahiltna Pass and NE side of Mount Foraker (see image). This was one of the most thrilling moments of the flight, with a view of Mount Foraker, the second highest peak in the Range, sitting in the middle foreground like an inverted ice cream cone. We continued our ascent, with Karstens Ridge & Harpers Glacier-Mount McKinley coming into view (see image). We were soon at a level allowing for a close-up, fascinating view of the summit area of Mount McKinley, the goal of many climbers (see image). The upper reaches resemble snowy hills, even though they are not. We also viewed the area known as the “Football Field”, which climbers cross at altitude. Our route took us over Upper Traleika Glacier (see image), as Mount McKinley (20320 ft) slipped away behind us. Our pilot (Bill P.), who handled this Cessna in this difficult terrain, was at complete ease in this environment, bespeaking of many years of experience. This enables us to enjoy our flight and obtain the images that I wanted without difficulty. He even suggested shots and maneuvered the Cessna into a favorable position. We maneuvered past the Upper Ruth Glacier-Don Sheldon Amphitheater (see image), heading to our glacier landing spot on Second Shot Glacier. Bill P. put us down on the glacier with a feather-like landing. After we exited the Cessna, we did some tourist images with us in them, leaning against the Cessna. We were two happy people.I spent about 20 minutes photographing this beautiful glacial cirque. When we landed, we join another flight-seeing aircraft already on the glacier. Taking images of the take-off (see image) provided us with some great photo opportunities. After the other plane had departed, our pilot Bill P. told us to be quiet and listen. In the ensuing silence, the only noise heard was the cracking of the glacial ice. We had become one with the mountains, breathing in the cool air and living the moment. All senses were operating in a magnified scale, with sounds and colors enhanced. This was one of the rare points of time which we strive to acquire, but is very elusive. Sadly, we departed Second Shot Glacier on our way back to Talkeetna. Our route took us over some beautiful peaks called “Little Switzerland”, then down the Ruth Glacier and back to civilization as we know it.  Travelers, if you can do this trip, find a way and do it. Forgo the deck of the cruise ship and get to see what the REAL ALASKA is, and has. I have run into too many people who are reluctant to plan their own trip. All one has to do is use rental cars, lodging, planes, trains, rafts, and common sense, and not rely on the ideas of other “TRIP SPECIALISTS”. It is not difficult to plan this yourself, giving you the opportunity to go and see what YOU want, and in the time frame you allocate. In fact, if you are interested in doing this, contact me at TripAdvisor and I will help you (FREE!!!!) get started.   DO NOT DEFACE THE ROCKS OR ITS SURROUNDINGS. YOU ARE ON FEDERAL/STATE PROPERTY, AND IT IS AGAINST THE LAW. LEAVE IT THE WAY NATURE INTENDED IT TO BE LEFT! Enjoy the trip and be safe.

However even if we had not not in the sea McKinley the bus trip would've been well worth taking. There are lots of other beautiful sites to see. And lots of wildlife we saw mountain goats, bears, moose, caribou, Eagles and other birds. The trip is eight hours long which sounds like a very long time but we never got bored. However I wouldn't recommend this for a family with children under 10 years old. I think the trip might be just too long for them. And it is definitely not a luxury tour remember to bring your own food and water. This is a little bit of a rough and ready type of trip….

On this day, the sky was as clear as it could be and not only did we see Mt. McKinley in all it's glory, covered in snow, against a brilliant blue sky, but we also lucked out with a tremendous showing of wildlife!!! The bus made several stops on the 90+ mile journey in and then out, at rest stops with pit toilets and viewing areas. I believe the closest viewing spot was 26 miles from the mountain. There was a great lunch at the Back Country Lodge and then snacks on the bus. It was a long day, but an amazing one!

Being a person who lives among the Rocky Mountains, I didn't think I would have such a reaction to this mountain. However, I was shocked at how majestic and gorgeous it was! This mountain clearly dominates the Alaskan landscape, being visible all the way in Anchorage even. As you take Hwy 1 north towards the park, the mountain grows clearer and clearer. You don't even need to go into Denali National Park to get a tremendous and unforgettable view. In fact, the Southern View Point along the highway offers postcard worthy shots (however, skip the Northern view point - the view is crap), as does the road to Talkeetna, and you also get numerous other shots as you travel north to the Denali park road. Inside the park, you can also get an amazing views, especially at Wonder Lake.If you have a car and don't feel like paying for a shuttle or tour bus into the park.

You will certainly meet fellow travelers and strike up conversation. This is America, the Beautiful. We saw 14 bears, many Moose, Dahl Sheep, Caribou. Birds (sadly no raptors this trip), magpie, jays, waterfowl. Small critters - squirrel, varmints. No wolf this time, but I'm sure they were roaming.

Denali,"Mount McKinley, more properly known as Denali, is incredible to behold and elusive to see in all its glory. As the highest peak in North America, Denali actually creates its own weather. As moisture laden clouds come in from the west, they run up against the sides of the mountain and are force upward. This vertical movement causes the temperature to drop, which lowers the ability of the cloud to hold onto its moisture and either it rains/snows or obscures the mountain from view. Local experts claim that only a third of visitors actually see the mountain, and a smaller number yet see it completely unobstructed. We entered the Denali Wilderness Preserve under a cloud layer with a misting rain but by the time we had gone far enough into the tundra, the mountain popped out, completely free of clouds. The sight of that mountain is stunning and more than worth the time it takes to get within sight of it. Although you can't guarantee a sighting of the mountain, the day spent in the Denali Wilderness Preserve is special. There are bears, wolves, Dall sheep, elk, caribou, moose and many other animals in their completely natural state. Visitors must ride in a comfortable Park Service bus since no private vehicles are permitted. Buses are equipped with telephoto video cameras with screens throughout the bus, that afford a closer look at the animals otherwise too far to see clearly. The driver is also your guide and they are very informative about the flora and fauna in the Park. Our driver, David Cohen, was a real gem. Sure hope you are lucky enough to draw him as your guide.","September 15, 2014",A Magestic Mountain Indeed,139,"Beechgrove, Tennessee",5

We saw so much wildlife; bears, moose, wolf, caribou, Dahl sheep. It was so incredible. Even all the wildflowers and fire weed were beautiful. I just loved being there. Even though it is one of the states in the United States, it is like being in another world. It is so virgin, untouched and wild. It's so hard to put into words just how amazing it was.","September 7, 2014",There are no words,24,"Brownsville, Wisconsin",5
Denali,"We saw the summit each day we were in Denali National Park. We were told that only 30% of people who come to Denali actually see the summit.

Denali,"My mom and I were on a wonderful cruise with Celebrity, but decided that it would be most worthwhile to do the interior of AK right after….7 days from Seward to Fairbanks. For time sake and saving dear readers from a novella, I’m going to skip right to our Denali adventure, then to the 10% club.First, I must mention that I purchased our tickets for the “Tundra Wilderness Tour” directly from Alaska.org. This is the tourism site for Alaska. They were fantastic with the order and we had tickets in hand within three days. Tundra Wilderness Tour (TWT) is an 8 hour bus ride into Denali National Park. Now, a bus ride is a loose term. As others had mentioned, it is a school bus- but it has coach seats. They do pack you in like sardines, but that is another review entirely! We saw lots of wildlife, but Denali (which should have been visible from the turnaround point) was MIA- clouds and rain, clouds and rain….This was our second let down, as the first was staying at Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge; not the lodge itself-- that was fantastic (and yet another review…) It was the “view of Denali” from the porch. It is not the lodges fault, but clouds, fog, and rain, clouds, fog, and rain prevented us to see any horizon for two days! Okay, fast forward. Back to TWT again, turnaround point and she’s hiding in the clouds, fog, and rain. Bummer! (Disappointed and thinking… ‘All this way and we don’t get to see her!’)The next morning we moved on from Denali, driving onwards via coach bus toward Fairbanks and our last day…..<<Insert the choir songs here>>the angels are singing, the sun is shining, no clouds in the sky- and behold, Denali in her glory! Beautiful craggy peaks with pristine snow, all of her! It was a sight we waited for our whole trip! It might have been for only about 5 minutes on a bus, but, at that moment, we were catapulted into the 10% club…..","September 6, 2014",From a Denali no-show to the 10% club!,32,Arizona,5

McKinley due to the cloud cover. We did manage to see the very top of the mountain one day when the clouds parted. It lasted about 5 minutes but was very exciting to see this huge snow covered mountain, the highest mountain in North America.

Denali,"We drove up from Anchorage to see Mount McKinley but after stopping at a Lodge 40 miles from the mountain, we did not get a chance to actually see it through the fog. We had a great time watching through the binoculars and hoping the fog would clear. We watched for a total of about 2 and a half hours and then had to get back to Anchorage to fly back to the states. There were several hundred other people all waiting to see the mountain but the fog only got thicker as we stayed to watch. Many people have seen Mount McKinley but I think you would have to book a tour to get closer to perhaps get a glimpse of the size of it. We did see Moose's tooth I believe it was called next to Mt McKinley but that was only 10,000 feet and Mt McKinley is more than 20,000 feet high. A fellow watcher had a picture of it that he took several days earlier and it was indeed a great site to see. ","September 2, 2014",Waited,12,"Lompoc, California",5

My husband and I along with the other couple with us could not believe how great this was. I would recommend this to anyone who really wants to see the mountain.

Probably told us more than we needed to know, but at least it was a lot of info and we could pick & choose what we wanted to remember.The Shuttle offered no food or water so we brought our own. We preferred not to be part of the Tour Buses with box lunches because we were concerned that it would be commercial (associated with the Cruise lines). Just our choice & the cost was a bit less on the Shuttle, even with the cost of our food and drink.The tour guide warned us before leaving the Wilderness Center, that no part of our bodies would hang out the windows. I thought that was really weird...until we had an adolescent brown bear JUST below my bus window!!! No wonder people love the bears. You just wanted to reach out and hug them. They were AMAZING. We got to see Caribou, as well as 2 moose, another mother bear & cubs, Dall sheep. It was delightful.August is a rainy month, therefore, mostly cloudy, misty & rainy, so we didn't get to see all of Mt. McKInley. We'll just have to settle for pictures of it.

Not all are guaranteed sightings because its nature. But you will see beautiful mountains, river streams and foliage. The guides have a high powered camera that feeds images of animals far away onto screens so you can get close up look at them. At about 60 mile mark if McKinely is in the mood you will see her in her majesty. On the day we went she was completely covered by clouds. The guides say she makes her own weather.

Mckinley comes out on average 1 in 4 days: the day we arrived late in the afternoon the mountain was out all day, so of course, for the next 3 days we were there, we never got to see it! we had reserved the glacier landing flight, so we could see it, and it was cancelled 3 times due to bad weather. we took the 8 hour bus ride into denali and didnt get to see it either. my suggestion, go for 4 days, and keep an eye on the weather. theres plenty to do around so you wont be bored! i wish we had stayed just one more day!!!!!!","August 4, 2014",you need four days,250,"Bogota, Colombia",3
Denali,"I remember looking around wondering where in the heck this mountain was amoung all these mountains. HA HA, didn't look high enough.

Denali,"If you go into Denali expecting to be disappointed if you don't see McKinley, then you are setting yourself up for a disappointing trip from the get go. BUT... If you go in knowing the chance of seeing 'her' is slim, and still enjoy the true beauty of the glorious vastness, then you can only be over the moon, like we were, when she shone in all her glory! We were fortunate to go on a morning when the only cloud cover was a sliver of thin cloud about half way down the mountain. We still can't get over the amount of beauty as far as the eye can see. Recommend spending at least 2 days in the area. One day to explore the first 14 miles on your own and the other to take a bus ride into the park. We opted for the shortest tour (plenty) to Toklat and though we didn't see too many animals, it was a worthwhile trip. We did get more time viewing caribou, moose, and bears in the first 14!","August 3, 2014",30% chance is worth the odds,19,"Stuart, Florida",5

Denali,"The entire park system was spectacular, we spent 4 days in and around the park. After recommendations from Diane one of the Park Rangers we hiked all the marked trails and had a wonderful time. On day three it was refreshing to see Diane (Park Ranger) on her personal time at the Visitor's Center planning another day hike to recommend to visitor's in the future. It was great to see first hand the professionalism of the staff to care about the park and the visitors. We saw Denali (Mt McKinley) two of the four days. Weather patterns change quickly and you should heed the advice of those who have been there and pack accordingly. We enjoyed the wildlife and views of this great park. By the recommendation of a friend we took the shuttle bus to the visitors center verses the Tour bus. Honestly it was great, both buses stop for the wildlife and you travel on the same road. Donna was our driver and she was extremely knowledgable of the entire park system.The Sled Dogs and demonstration was great, plan it into your day it is worth it to see the energy and excitement these animals have to what they do.Even my teenage son loved the time in the park and in the evenings with the absence of WiFi.CAUTION: Glitter Gulch = $$$$","August 2, 2014",Captivating...,21,"Cedar Springs, Michigan",5

As it is North America's highest peak at almost 21,000 Feet and is only visible about 25% of the time, we felt particularly fortunate.To say it's awesome, beautiful, etc. doesn't do it justice.

We were there for almost 3.5 days in that area and we were able to see the mountain all days! We did flightseeing from Talkeetna and had a brilliant weather. We were able to see the Mountain just as we started getting closer to Talkeetna. Once we were on the road again to Denali NP, we could still see the mountain! So were we the next 2 days when we took shuttle inside the park. It is such a beautiful sight and makes the surrounding little extra beautiful when the Mountain is out! If you can, try to book your park shuttle earlier in the day for better chances of seeing the mountain.","July 29, 2014",Beautiful if you are lucky!,36,"Santa Cruz, California",5

We saw some mountains and we were trying to determine if it was ""the mountain"". The next day it was perfectly sunny and blue skies and you no longer had to ask. It just was there towering above the rest. It is so beautiful and I could hardly take my eyes off of it. Since only 30% see it, I would recommend checking the weather if you are driving just to see it. We happened to be staying at the Mt McKinley Lodge. We never saw it when we had our trip to Denali National Park. ","July 24, 2014",Majestic,13,Smithfield,5

Even in Alaska where the expansive views sometimes make it hard to realize how big things are Denali stands out as a monster. If you have the opportunity, this is a must see in Alaska and I hope the weather is great.

Denali,"We arrived to Denali on July 1st near 6:15pm with our RV to camp at the TEK campground. We checked in and rushed over to the WAC (Wilderness Access Center) to pick up our Junior Ranger backpacks for the kids. Sadly, we arrived to the WAC at 7:05 and were unable to pickup the backpacks. Off to TEK were went.We were in awe over the beauty of each and every vista. The park is enormous and the slower ride helps protect wildlife crossing and any passengers as the roadway is narrow and uneven a bit past Savage River. The drive to TEK from the bookstore was a bit over an hour. However, it is an hour of spectacular views.We had a nice spot at TEK and our family spent the next three days hiking, observing wildlife, riding the shuttle bus and enjoying the beautiful air. Denali is a special place that every person should visit! We were able to see Doll Sheep, 1 Grizzly, Moose, Caribou, Golden Eagle, Red Fox, Arctic Ground Squirrel, Magpie, Spruce Grouse, Common Raven, and tons of tundra flowers. The TEK camphost was a family with young boys from NJ who was extremely friendly and kind. We enjoyed chatting with them and going on a hike through the woods with them. My children were delighted to meet them and did not want to leave.We wore our bear bells, had our bear spray and enjoyed hiking through trails that had seen limited footprints. Our children enjoyed the spongey ground that the tundra can provide. TEK does have a ranger led talk each evening that we did not have a chance to attend. Although, the topics seemed to be great.We had fun jumping on and off the shuttle buses and enjoyed hiking up the Alpine Trail near the Eielson Visitor Center at mile 66. This center was well organized and offers ranger led hikes. Sign up as soon as possible as spots fill quickly. They also have wonderful exhibits of the many aspects of Denali, the wildlife and those who hike it. This center does not have any store or foodservice. It does offer a water bubbler to refill your reusable jug.My only complaint about the shuttle bus is that you can not ride it out of the park to the WAC center. This prohibited us from signing up for the dog sled demo and taking part in the Junior Ranger Activity. We did purchase a full one day pass on the shuttle bus to reserve a seat for each of us. However, riding the bus from TEK out does not require a pass (or so it seemed)Our favorite pull off was Polychrome Pass. Please encourage your driver to stop here as it is not a required stop any longer. It has a unbelievable view with many different shades of color. The Toklat Station does have a small bookstore but not any foodservice. We were able to see many Doll Sheep at this stop.We did visit the Bookstore and WAC center on the way out and spent very little time (less than 30 minutes) as we were a bit overwhelmed by the amount to people. This area was action packed and was difficult to navigate as there was an overabundance of tours, school groups and people.Our family enjoyed this lovely place and had a hard time leaving. We were fortunate enough to get extrodinary views of Mt. Denali/McKinley on the 4th of July. The mountain is unbelievable and extremely beautiful when seen.

With its own weather system, it may be that you can see the whole mountain, only the bottom, only the top or only the middle. There are two amazing overlooks along the Parks Hwy between Anchorage and Denali to see Denali. The best viewing in the park is at Wonder Lake, Savage River, or to take a tour bus where you can see it from Eieslon Vistors Center inside the park.

All Outdoorsmen know “that the mountain makes it’s own weather!”I cannot recommend that one pre-plan a trip to Denali or to the Kenai. Rain, snows, and clouds are part of nature. Luck has nothing to do with a visit in great weather.Do plan your visit to Denali and the Kenai in the summer for nine – fourteen days, and do not plan on Tuesday for Denali. Use your laptop and weather.com to KNOW when to visit Denali or the Kenai.I had been keeping an eye on Denali weather for nearly a week, and today offered a sunny picture perfect day to visit Denali. Fortunately I have taken the Grand Denali Tour in previous years, and I highly recommend a flight tour out of Talkeentna. I prefer a flight tour, which lands in a permitted area in Denali.Denali and the Kenai are surprising small areas of Alaska, and a rental car offers the flexibility to experience Denali and the Kenai in the best weather. “You make your own luck.”I do not want to cruise the “Inside Passage,” and be in lock step format.","June 28, 2014",“that the mountain makes it’s own weather!”,4951,"Centerville, Ohio",5

Park your car and head to the main view point. Then take the short trail to another vantage point. There is a river that runs by this scenic spot - great foreground for your pics of Mt McKinley!The next time we saw Mt McKinley was on our drive into Denali on the park road. Just beautiful!The next day we took the park shuttle bus to Toklat and were fortunate to be able to see it a third time!.

We had booked well in advance for a shuttle bus as far into the park as we could go, hoping to see some animals.We appreciate that the animals have to be there for us to view them, but we had been led to believe that drivers were prepared to stop and give time to allow visitors to view the animals. We had 2 different drivers. One outwards and one for the return.The first barely gave us time in the designated stopping areas, let alone time to spontaneously stop for animal viewing. He even wanted to go, leaving some visitors behind even though they were only a little late and had left their bag on board.The driver for the return announced on departure that he wouldn't be stopping as he didn't have long to get back. He told us not to bother to call out.When we got back to the car park we drove our own car into the park as far as the publuc are allowed, and here, we saw some bears.","June 11, 2014",To the shuttle bus drivers it is just a job.,25,"Norwich, United Kingdom",3

Upon arrival on Wednesday May 14, the Mountain was in full view, un-obscured by clouds of any sort. This was truly an amazing sight as only about 30 % of visitors actually see the mountain because the Mountain summit is regularly obscured by clouds. The next morning the mountain was still visible and quite beautiful. The natives call it Denali, not Mt. McKinley. If your planning a visit, try to plan for a May visit. The month of May normally gets less rain than June, which should increase your chances of seeing the mountain in her full splendor. Even though you are about 40 miles away, the mountain is so big, it appears closer. Also, by going in May, there may not be any mosquitos out yet.","May 29, 2014",Denali / Mt.

Denali,"I just went to the main visitor center and did some hiking from there, which is free. I had a wonderful day of hiking and saw such beauty and a lot of wildlife. I am TALL, so taking the bus tour into the park simply isn't an option. The buses are all traditional school buses, with seating designed for kids to ride less than an hour to school. To use these buses for 4 or 8 hour excursions into the park isn't even sensible for normal sized adults...it's impossible for anyone over about 6'2"" tall, or certainly anyone with leg circulation issues. I tried to make a reservation to get the seating where there might be more legroon, such as directly behind the driver, but the operator would not make such an accommodation. Anyway...the park can be enjoyed without one of the bus tours, and I had a great time hiking. ","March 26, 2014",Oh for a TALL option...,66,"Dacono, Colorado",5
Denali,"We took a family trip to Alaska in early June. Denali was one of our best stops. The weather was fabulous. For three days straight we were able to see the mountain top. We were told that you can only see the Mountain top about 20 percent of the time and most of those days are in June. We took the early 8 hour bus trip into the park. We saw a lot of animals but they were at a distance. We got back around 2 pm. Because it was so early and so clear we made a last minute decision to take a bush plane ride to the mountain. We called the local airport and we were able to book a plane. The flight back to the mountain was about 45 minutes. We flew past lots of other fabulous sights. When we reached the mountain, the plane few around it a few times at about 14,000 feet. We could see mountain above and below us. We could see climbers and their camps all over the mountain. We were told that June is the busiest month for climbers. We could see climbers at various stages of the ascent. We are so happy that we booked the bush plane. The flight really enhanced our appreciation for the mountain and area. When we drove back to our small hotel we were met by a large Moose in the parking lot of the hotel. He was about 20 feet away from us. Since we did not see anything that close in the park we were overjoyed at this delight near the end of our fabulous day. The next day we did a four hour white water rafting trip on the Nenana River. It was spectacular too.","March 13, 2014","Amazing, Amazing, Amazing",225,"Punta Gorda, Florida",5

But this trip turns out to be more expensive than the one which is run from Talkeetna. If you want to save money, stay for a night at Talkeetna, have the trip and come down to Denali. I can vouch that this will be the trip of your life. Costs $325 from Talkeetna. Don't skimp. I haven't heard of a second place in this world where a plane lands on a glacier.

McKinley from the train were beautiful. This all depends on the weather, of course. The highlight of our trip was a small airplane tour circling Mt McKinley and the other mountains (I have forgotten their names now). This tour originated in Talkeetna, and it is one of our all-time favorite traveling highlights. It was expensive; I believe it was $250 per person, but so worth it.

My view was from Telketna which has a viewing area just outside the village. Ironically, the best place to see the mountain is actually outside Denali Park. If flying is your thing, there are plenty of chartered flights that take you around the peak. From the ground, there are 2 really good spots, best one is on petersville road past the mining area which gets you the closest to the base that you can get by car. (4-wheel drive and very detailed map required).

Our driver talked incessantly and every other sentence admonished her passenegers that they must remain totally quiet. We felt she treated us like grade school children. Worse, we paid to be treated this way. We were signed on for the 12 hour trip but returned on a different bus halfway through. Too bad we didn't have that driver the whole time since he only made comments occasionally when there was an animal to see.","September 17, 2013","The shuttle bus was poor, not the mountain",75,"Plymouth, Minnesota",2

Most people stayed on the bus and went to Eielson and back. There were several bathroom stops and WILDLIFE. We saw 5 moose, 6 dall sheep, 3 grizzly bears (1 had 2 babies) 3 caribou, 3 golden eagles and a couple of squirrels. We were very lucky, however we were the 80% that did not see Denali. The deciduous trees all were changing colors and no BUGS.","September 9, 2013",Shuttle Bus,39,Sacramento,5
Denali,"Our tour of the Denali Park began at 6:30AM when we boarded the park’s tour bus for an eight-hour trip into the wilds of Alaska. The only bad thing I have to say about the day was that it was hot! Thank goodness for an air-conditioned bus. From the first minute to the last we had a wonderful running commentary from our driver/tour guide. We were lucky to see 4 of the 5 major animals of the park, moose, caribou, Denali Sheep, and a sow grizzly with her cub we did not see a wolf. The bus stopped each time we would see the animals and photos were taken. Half way into the park is the first short rest stop and the turnaround for the 4 hour tours.After a 4 hour ride into the park we reached our turnaround point and a vista of “The Mountain” as the locals call Mt. McKinley. The bus stopped for the photo ops of McKinley. We were lucky and had clear sky all day.

The driver could tell we would not be able to see the mountaintop very long once we got to our final destination so he stopped along the way so everyone could get breathtaking photos of Mt. McKinley.

Denali,"We were part of the lucky few (apparently only about 20% of visitors actually get to see Denali due to weather conditions) who got to glimpse at the spectacular Denali/Mt McKinley).There are basically only a few ways to see the park. There is only one road, and cars are only allowed to drive into the park for the first 12-15 miles (except for film crews). So your options are to hike or bike, fly over it, or to take a bus. The only buses that can navigate the roads are the old school bus types, since their transmissions can handle it. Most of the road is not paved and you can't go fast on the winding steep parts. Some of the buses (paid tours) have been refurbished on the inside with nicer seats, drop down screens and air conditioning. As far as seeing wildlife, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances. Our tour guide let us know right from the beginning that sometimes you will see nothing, and other times you are more fortunate. You can find out from your hotel if other tours have had sightings and at what time of day. The afternoon tours (starting around 2:30) tend to see more. Also, the deeper into the park you go, the more you see usually. Pay attention when the guide explains to you how to spot wildlife! It takes a while to get the hang of it, but you have many hours to learn while on the bus! Many animals are behind thick brush. You might want to take binoculars, as well. Our bus driver had a powerful zoom lens and would stop and use it so that you could see animals on the drop down screens in the bus.It is pretty rare for animals to come close to the road near loud buses, but it does happen. We saw a caribou running down the road. This is a huge park and you are in deep wilderness. It's a lot different than Yellowstone, but it can be a wonderful experience. And, you often see wildlife when you are least expecting it.We saw a moose right outside of the Visitor's Center!","August 31, 2013",Have modest expectations and you won't be disappointed!,31,Bethesda,4

Denali,"Got back about 1 month ago from a 2 week land and water vacation to Alaska. I have struggled to put into words what was good about the trip and what could use a huge bit of improvement.First of all if you are like me I was expecting animals running around everywhere in the park. Not going to happen. When you do see them you will ususally need binoculars. We were put on a bus that is run by the preserve. Thinking we would not be on this bus except to get into the park , we didn,t give it too much of a concern. Eight hours later, a box lunch that is filled with a greasy karaboo sausage, a slice of cheese, a pkg of almonds and sunflower seeds, and raisins, and oh yes a bottle of water I could not believe what we had just experienced. Female guide/bus driver(was a very old beige schoolbus)probably donated or bought very inexpensively from a school in the lower 48, never stopped talking from the time she put the headphones on until we departed 8 and 1/2 hours later. The whole experience was very dissappointing. We had taken our nine year old grandson with us and all of us were hugely discouraged. Probably he was more excited about me tasting the sausage( which was horrible) than seeing any animal that were spotted. Mainly because you can sit in your home and see much more on a TV screen that you will ever see there. Oh by the way, tv screens were also used on the bus, especially when the driver is the only person seeing an animal and she zones in on them with a huge zoom lens, yes you are seeing it on the tv screen hooked to the bus. The only time you are allowed off the bus is for three bathroom breaks in the 8.5 hours we were on the bus. I guess I had created in my mind this image of wildlife running everywhere in this huge park. We were all very much dissappointed.You will be asked to donate to college funds, food for the table and living expenses from every tour you take as well. This was by far the most expensive trip we have ever taken. We will not be going back for sure. Granted I am glad we went, but just keep in mind there are as many animals in your own back yard as you will see on this trip.I also couldn,t believe what I was seeing when we pulled up to the lodge from our coach on arrival there. If any of you have ever been to Gatlinbug Tennesee and the Smoky Mountains. This is about the same level of tourist trap feeling you will get from Denali.Mount Mckinley was beautiful. We was able to see it for the 2 days we were there. I guess we are very lucky and they say only about thirty percent of the folks who go there actually get to see the peak.We were flown in to Fairbanks, and finished our trip in Vancouver. One week of land touring and the other week on the Emerald Princess cruise ship.","August 29, 2013",Denali Park big dissappointment,92,Ohio,3

The day long bus ride is interesting but the bus is just one step above a school bus. Our trip had a semi edible box lunch and a small bottle of water. Bring extra water since it can get warm on the bus. It was so dusty that we kept the windows barely open.

Denali,"Denali Park is very majestic...makes you think about middle earth. There is really only one road into the park; you can only drive a short distance. You need to take a Park Service bus if you really want see anything. We made the mistake of just taking a 4 to 5 hour bus tour. After venturing into the park - we really regretted we did not signup to the full park tour to the end of the road - about 12 hours. It seemed really too long when we read about it - but once you're there, you want to see it all. As you go further in, the park is less forested and more tundra- but very striking - especially if you are lucky enough to see Mt McKinley. Lots of critters in the park, just have to keep you eye out for them. Check out the visitor center musem if you have time.

You are asked to spot the animals, but they do a pretty good job. This is surprising since the roads are not always easy to manage with a school bus.. We took the shuttle to Eilson Center. We did not get all of the history and narrative of the Tundra tour, but we also paid about 1/4 of the price. We brought our own lunch and ate it on the bus. They encourage this. The bus driver still talked the entire way, so we didn't feel we missed much. We saw caribou, moose, several grizzly bear families, golden eagle, quail,and sheep (high on a hilltop - white spots). Eilson was nice, but the film was not working. We had heard that was very good. We didn't stay more than an hour and we were able to get right on another bus back. We bought a packed lunch at McKinley chalet. It was expensive, but they had lots of food and water in it. Neither of us could eat the whole thing so we had snacks left over. The sandwich was pretty good. You must order this the night before and then pick it up in the morning. The park is just breathtaking. New scenery around every corner.

You basically ride a bus around the park the entire day, See animals way off in the distance and listen to NPR like tour guides share basic facts. Not much action and adventure!

You can’t take a personal vehicle within 50 miles of Mt. McKinley, which is likely why 70% of visitors to the park don’t even catch a glimpse of it. Even if you take one of the park-approved bus tours, you’ll spend ten hours on a bus for ten minutes of wildlife, if you’re lucky. As an alternative, go to Telkeetna, on the park’s southeastern edge, and take a flight-seeing tour via one of the local airlines.

Denali,You can see the McKinley from the Denali Park and that is a wonderful view. But you can fly over it and land on one of its glaciers or just fly around it. The only thing I recommend about the flying is to book it at the same day you are taking the flying.

I expected the focus of the park to be the mountain (which was visible and magnificent) but there is so much more to the park! The park road is a great way to expereince the interior of the park and view the braided river valleys and surrounding peaks - and you're almost gauranteed to see wildlife. If you can, get out and hike a bit. There are hardly any trails, but the Rangers tell you to just bushwhack - which we did.

Plus this would mean you can get going earlier and stop off at one of the stops and do some hikes which are fabulous.

Denali,"I have been to several National Parks and am a HUGE advocate and encourrage people to go and see what this great nation has to offer. Denali is one of them. Many of the National Parks are accessible by private automobile, but not Denali. You can only drive into the park 15 miles, then if one wants to see or explore more of Denali you must either be staying in the park at a camp ground and even then motorized vehicles are prohibited or are under strict limits (once in they are not allowed to be driven, unless out of the park and then you are not allowed back into your campsite).You can book different types of bus tours to see more of the park (each has their prices depending upon the type of bus-school bus with a narrator on broad, luxury buses etc). Read the reviews on the different types of tours best suited for you.What I found so interesting and 'progessive' about Denali is that cars aren't allowed throughout the park. Even on the bus tours, the buses must turn off when observing the wildlife as not to get the wildlife acclimated to anything human or at least minimize as much as possible the wildlife getting used to humans and human things, noises etc. HOWEVER they encourage you to explore the environment and the park. You are allowed to get out of the bus at any time and hike (with one 5 mile exception and if at an animal siting, then the driver can only let you out 1/2 mile away).There are many ranger lead activities and hikes, dog sledding experience etc.This park is really trying to keep Denali and the park as close to preserved as possible.

It is about 1/4 the cost and you will see exactly the same things. Our bus driver was very informative and interesting but that is not a requirement of the job. It's possible that your green bus driver would not be as interesting, but I would take the chance for the major difference in cost. There is only one road into and out of the park and most of it is dirt and very narrow in places. The animals you see will vary depending on the time of year and luck. I found it to be a bit boring because the scenery is interesting and the mountains spectacular, but after 8 hours on a bus..well, you get the picture. It is unlikely that you see McKinley because it is 75 miles away. Drive south toward Anchorage and take the Talkeetna road exit. 14 miles later, you will be rewarded with a view site presents McKinley and its two neighbor peaks for perfect viewing...if weather permits. The main building contains many interesting stuffed animals and information about this very young National Park.

We had accepted that we weren't going to get to see the Great One in full glory.As we were driving south towards Anchorage on the fourth morning, the skies became ocean blue and the clouds moved away. It was the first full viewing in weeks according to locals. When you view it from 60 miles away and are still amazed by the size, then think about the people up there climbing it. What a sight! There are several scenic pull-outs on the side of the highway that have bathrooms and plenty of parking. You will also find displays showing you which mountains you are looking at and they have spotting scopes to get a closer look.I recommend doing a McKinley fixed wing flight with glacier landing (we weren't able to land due to weather). It is difficult to imagine the amount of mountain there until you are at 9000 feet and still looking way above you at the top.

It was so clear the bus driver and park ranger were taking pictures too. Be sure and plan plenty of time in Denali, there is so much to see.

Denali,"We did this tour on a beautiful sunny Sept day. It was the last tour of the season as the park was closing. We had 20 year veteran tour guide Marsha Anderson driving our bus and she has to be the most knowledgeable tour guide I've ever met. Her eight and a half hours of informative dialogue, spotting of wildlife and plant life made this tour as excellent as it could be. Even though we had a sunny day our arrival at Mt McKinley was met with cloud blocking half the mountain. I would highly recommend this tour. We saw many bears, dall sheep, cow & bull moose, caribou, eagles etc.. ","October 4, 2012",Tundra Wilderness Tour,90,Brockville,5
Denali,"We looked into all the options that takes you close to see Mt. Mckinley and at the end decided to make reservations for the park shuttle bus that takes you to the end of the road, Kantishna, and back. I am very happy that we made the right choice for us. It was the most economical way and we were fortunate enough to see both bears and Mt. Mckinley peaking through the clouds which was for about 20 minutes, but seemed like 20 seconds.With that being said, however, if you would like to spend more time off and on the bus to take pictures, etc. when you do encounter exciting things like bears and Mckinley peaking through the clouds, when they DO show, it might be worth taking the other tour buses like Kantishna Experience Tour which is more than triple the price, but is more flexible with time. After all, the shuttle buses runs on a schedule, so they can not take too much time at one place to stop and let everyone take pictures or let people off the bus. They only let us off at the stops, not when bears or Mckinley appears. ","October 2, 2012",Hardly can see it but was worth the trip,296,"Huntington Beach, California",5

We rode in a 6 passenger twin prop plane and the views were fantastic. Our pilot (I can't remember his name) was an older gentleman who was born and raised in Alaska, and was an excellent guide. We flew around the peaks and valleys of the mountain and sometimes seemed so close that our wings were brushing the snow covered mountain (not really).

Denali,"I started seeing Denali in June 1990 and have seen it 1-3 times annually since 2000 when I started helping friends in Fairbanks as a volunteer on the North Slope. The first recommendation I got from the first of my friends to live in Fairbanks was to hire a plane in Talkeenta, I recommend K2 Aviation, I was also given a non-recommendation, but I won't mention that here as service may have changed. Jim was K2 company founder and owner at the time, and Fred Beckey happened to be at the airport, and we took him along on a joy ride (he had just come off down a mountain in that area). A flight see is the best way to see Denali unless you climb it. You have two types of choices: a) an orbit, or b) a glacier landing in a couple of different places.Some services will fly you directly over the summit with oxygen and pressurization. Our flight July 2012 was canceled due to bad weather.You have to realize that Denali isn't merely high at 20K ft., but it also stands quite high in relief depending how you count 17K ft. above the surrounding terrain. Other figures might be slightly less by a few K feet. Many non-climbing and a few climbing enthusiasts will claim this is the tallest mountain from base to summit (Nanga Parbat in Pakistan holds that record on the Rupal Flank side, of Mauna Kea if you drain the pacific Ocean). Weather will be your big problem. During early summer, I have heard the stats are about 1 clear day in 4, but later in summer toward fall, you will have better odds.A nice Natl. Park Service visitor center is located in Talkeetna as well as the Park entrance itself. It will help you to know and appreciate the mountain if you know a little history and a few of the features (like there's a North and higher South summit).If you don't have time or money for a flight see, it is visible with difficulty from various road areas on rare clear days near Anchorage (some elevation will help), Fairbanks, or from near the Park in the Parks highway. The best land location is generally regarded at Wonder Lake which requires taking the shuttle bus or the final week when the Park opens the road to private car traffic. This is all the short version of advice.","September 25, 2012",This is the highest point in North America,37,"Mountain View, California",4
Denali,"We stayed in Healy for five days so that we could visit the park. Took the park shuttle bus in four different times to Wonderlake and to Eilson. If someone had told us spending days on a bus would be the highlight of our life we would have said thats crazy...but it was. We saw about 25 Grizzly bears and cubs ..several times within fifty yards so I got incredible pictures...also saw rutting moose, caribou, Dal sheep and a fox. The bus drivers...with one exception...were incredibly sharp eyed and patient with those of us who wanted to hang out close to the animals for long periods...they were also very willing to share their knowledge and ask questions. The drive into the park is unforgettable... sit on the left hand side going in for the best views...unless you are terrified of heights i which case do something else. The most incredible sight however was when on the forth day Mt. McKinley...aka Denali...came into view. It took your breath away. We did not hike from the bus because we were sort of afraid of the bears although I wish we had. We were there at the first of Sept....the tundra was red...the aspens yellow.

Denali,"I know that is a bold statement but once you have been you will know. Do not just go to visitor center. Sign up for a bus trip to back country and see the OPEN spaces.

It was great. Go for Stony Hill Overlook (milepost 63). It will take you to the mountains, the valley and the tundra.

Denali,"Denali is the centerpiece of any tour to Alaska. Having seen it from the air many times before, which is spectacular in itself, seeing it from the ground is truly AWESOME. The size and beauty of the mountain cannot be described, you have to see it to believe it. We were there on a day when the mountain was visible from the base to the top, which is rare due to the weather around the mountain, and also when the changing season from Summer to Fall created a very colorful display of the surrounding mountains. A truly beautiful and awe inspiring site to see. Don't visit Denali without taking the Tundra Wilderness Tour. Our Guide was superb. Tom had climbed some of the peaks surrounding Denali and was an encyclopedia of knowledge about the terrain and the animals. We were able to see a Grizzly, several Moose and calves, plenty of Dall Sheep clinging to the mountain sides, Golden Eagles, and the State Bird of Alaska, the Ptarmigan. With Tom's expertise of the park the entire tour was outstanding in every way. ","September 5, 2012",Unbelievably Majestic,34,"Lubbock, Texas",5
Denali,"This is the big boy of the North American Continent. Excellent viewing for us. The View from Eielson Visitor Center was the best. The mountain can be viewed from the State Park on the Denali Park Road but that side is generally obscured by cloud at least partially. We took some very good shots of this monster mountain. The Visitors Center at Eielson had a relief map marking all the assault paths made on the mountain over the years and a bit of history for climbers claiming to have climbed it's highest peaks and those that actually did. We took a bus to the Visitors Center and as much as I enjoyed seeing the mountain, I cannot recommend the buses in Denali Park. The park concession uses old Blue Bird School buses and the road is in the shape you would expect something that freezes 8 months out of the year to be in. So if your young and don't mind hanging your camera out the window with 30 others, having folks stand up in the middle of your shot, go for it. If you are mature, got a dollar and arthritis, take an air tour. Fantastic wildlife viewing but I question the wisdom of using buses to protect the wildlife from people. At first glance it appears to be in the best interest of the commissionaires. Bus after bus. The shuttles are nice if you like the trails. I do but sometimes they are full! Especially when your tired. And for the record ""Nice mountain, Big deal"" no one's opinion is stupid. Stupid, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder.The real danger to the animals are the people working on the road and the concessionaire.

The park bus system is quite good and a value at $50 per adult per day to go the full distance into the park. Private tours may be more comfortable. If you go on a ship cruise with a land package here, make sure you get deep into the park. Many of the cruise packages only take people to the education center that is not very far in the park and may have only one chance to see Mt.

Denali,"So many people get squeezed onto those old, uncomfortable school buses for up to 8 hours - if I'd known that I would not have agreed as it was a long, hard day with very quick stops to stretch the legs occasionally. I've had major spinal surgery a couple of years ago and even though I'm much better, this was a difficult day and my very fit husband agreed - he was even sore at the end of all those hours on a cramped bus. The guide was very enthusiastic even about specks on the horizon (sheep!!) which she zoomed in on her camera for sometimes 5 minutes or so...if you've ever visited Australia and especially New Zealand, there are masses of sheep to be seen all over the countryside. We just couldn't understand the excitement about sheep. The ""new technology""...the screens on bus so we could look at the guide's video were nothing amazing when it's just like watching someone's home movies on TV but at least at home you're in a comfortable chair. Again we couldn't understand the guide's excitement. It was interesting to see the fall colors in the tundra and we loved seeing the grizzly bears, if not for that we would have given this tour a rating of terrible. The lunch box (eaten on bus) was very ordinary and all the people around me were using their teeth to open the packet of sausage... I gave up as didn't want to go home with a very sore back as well as a broken tooth! The guide should have offered scissors to help us open those. We think this tour was just too long but we probably should have asked more questions before signing up. Don't know if there's someway for length of time to be reduced and still see a few animals? Another must is better transport and /or less people on each bus if they plan to keep charging what they do (it felt like a big money making exercise) and we felt like cattle packed onto a truck and thrown a pack of food which was difficult to open!","August 29, 2012","The ""Tundra tour"" at almost 8 hours - too long!",490,"Canberra, Australia",2

Denali,If you can see it you are truly lucky. Best viewing is in the winter. We didn't see it in July. Flight sightseeing tours are available at BIG cost if you can stomach a small bush plane. The NPS offers half and full day tours on their school buses with knowageable drivers. The half day tour takes you in 14 miles with the longer one going further in. Both are wonderful with opportunities to see wildlife - the longer one offers the greatest opportunity to see wildlife. We took the shorter and were not disappointed. Saw caribou and eagles and bear and dall sheep and moose. Did not get to see the Great One for cloud cover. ,"August 16, 2012",The Great One!,318,"Houston, Texas",5
Denali,"Mt Denali/McKinley is the highest peak in North America and the most impressive one. The views are incredible. You don't have to be inside the national park to view the mountain. Some of the great views are from Talkeetna and from Parks highway. Unfortunately the whole mountain is often shrouded by clouds and they even call it as ""30% club"" since its only visible 30% of the time or 30% of the visitors get to see it. So it a hit or miss but don't get discouraged or disappointed because its still quite an experience to be there.I was there during the first week of July. It was mostly cloudy everywhere I've been in Alaska during that time.I got partially lucky and was only able to see portions of the mountains. It looked very majestic and views were breathtaking. The views near Eielson visitor center is unparalleled (again if you are lucky enough). I saw the peak up close by an airplane tour and I strongly recommend that since viewing from ground is often not possible. The peak is often visible above the clouds so by airplane tour you have better chance of viewing than from the ground.If you don't want to spend money on airplane tour or don't want to gamble on viewing the mountain then I would recommend Kenai Fjord National park down south, which is totally a different world but a very spectacular one that doesn't disappoint.If you are taking bus tour then don't take all the way Kantishna because there is not much in Kantishna, not even a good view and its just TOO long. The cabins there are not worth the price IMHO (because of its location). You may take the bus tour up to Eielson visitor center or Wonder lake but at least up to Eielson visitor center because that's where some of the incredible views of Mt. Denali can be seen and also plenty of wildlife albeit at a long distance along the way (between the entrance and Eielson not just at Eielson). You need a binocular or camera with super zoom lens. You may rent binoculars at Riley Creek Mercantile.It's a wonderful experience to remember but don't count on viewing the peak though. There is no single best time to view the peak but based on what I heard the chances are better in early morning than later in the day. Good luck.","August 16, 2012",Majestic & breathtaking if you are fortunate enough to see it!,75,IAH,5
Denali,"Our advise is to stop and take a picture when the mountain is visible and get out the binoculars and take the time to enjoy this majestic mountain. We took the park shuttle through Denali and were very lucky to see McKinley at 8:30 AM. By the time we got to the visitor's center, it was shrouded in clouds. The mountain is so high it creates it's own weather. It was truly a highlight for us in the 3 days we were in Denali.","August 15, 2012",Takes your breath away,54,"Oceanside, California",5

Denali,"Seeing Denali aka Mt. McKinley is definitely worth the time and effort to get there! We love the National Parks, and there is nothing like Denali NP. Only one road in, and private cars aren't allowed after the first 15 miles. It is an amazingly wild and pristine place -- keep it that way! We took the 6.5 hour tour/drive on the National Park bus to Toklat Lake (the last of the day, leaving at 5 p.m. The long days of summer make it possible -- not dark until after midnight). Great tour guide, incredible vistas, inlcuding Mt. McKinley, and lots of animals in the wild (10 grizzlies, moose, caribou, rams, etc.) The mountain itself is so big it doesn't look possible, even as it is surrounded by other giant mountains -- it is so much bigger than the others. 18,000 feet of mountain plus 2,000 in elevation above sea level.","August 2, 2012",Worth it!,60,"Lexington, Kentucky",5

Denali,"I thought for this review I would share some different places to spot the mountain. I have been fortunate enough to spend an entire summer in the Denali National Park area and have seen the mountain from several places. Keep in mind that statistically, only 30% of visitors actually get to see it during their visit as it creates its own weather and is typically covered (at least partially, if not fully) in clouds. I would suggest a visit no less than 5 days, while I think a full week is ideal. Not only will your chances of seeing it be greater, but there are tons of wonderful things to do while in the area.1. Shuttle bus in Denali National Park - Park road provides some of the best viewing spots. However, seeing the mountain should not be your primary motivation for taking the bus as you do have to pay for it, and still, no guarantee it will be visible.2. Roughly miles 7-10 of the Park road - You are allowed to drive your own vehicle to Savage River, which is mile 15 on Park road for free (past that, you have to purchase the shuttle bus ticket.) From this view, the mountain does not look THAT big due to smaller mountains being much closer... that is until you realize that McKinley is blanketed in snow, while the nearer mountains are not. 3. Savage Alpine Trail - As I said, you can drive your car to Savage at mile 15 on Park road. From there, you can park your car and do some hiking. Take the trail that leads to Savage Rock, then continue up the mountain on the Savage Alpine Trail (Please note that it is a moderate climb to the top, but the trail is well-maintained!) Even if McKinley is not visible, the panoramic views of the park from the top are magnificent. And it's FREE!4. Old Denali Hwy - (Please note that it is in the agreement of some rental car agencies that you DO NOT take your rental on this road so please check! It is not fully paved, and a little rough in spots. If you do take this road, drive slowly.) You'll find Old Denali Hwy from the Parks Hwy in Cantwell (about 20 miles south of Denali National Park, roughly.) I couldn't tell you for sure how far down the road we went to see it, probably 20-30 minutes, but if it is clear, look back west (toward the Parks hwy.) Even if the mountain is not visible, this is a great place to do some blueberry picking in August :)5. Talkeetna - The road to Talkeetna is also off of the Parks Hwy, about 100 miles north of Anchorage. On a clear day, you'll catch some great views of the mountain on the way to Talkeetna. Also, once you get to town (it's a tiny place, very easy to get around), turn left and drive as far as you can and park by the short trail that leads to the river. In 2010 we were able to walk up and down the riverbank and got some spectacular shots of McKinley, but this year the river was much higher and we were not able to walk as far.6. Flight-seeing Tours - From the air your chances of seeing McKinley jump to 90%. Despite the high ticket price ($300-$400 per person), it's a great way to see not only Mount McKinley up close, but affords magnificent views of the rest of Denali National Park as well. I know you can take these tours from both the Denali area and Talkeetna.If you're not one of those people that plans every second of your trip prior to departure, simply driving is a great way to see this beautiful part of Alaska.

Denali,"Denali national park is an impressive location to visit. If you are lucky you will see mount McKinley. We visited for 3 days and every evening we drove the 15 mile paved road that you can drive on your own. Beyond this only shuttle buses are allowed. Every day we saw something different. Moose appear to be more active at dusk and we saw them at least twice in the same pond by the road. Also saw porcupine next to the road. One of those evenings the clouds lifted enough to get a good view of Mt McKinley. This day had been cloudy all day and the mountain had been invisible all day. We finally saw it that day at around 10:30 pm from this paved road. Thus we became part of the 32% of visitors that see the mountain, the rest of the time it is hidden by clouds.I highly recommend taking the time to drive this road maybe after dinner. Driving should be fairly slow since wildlife can appear anytime and cross the road.","July 28, 2012",Take the time to drive the paved 15 mile road in Denali National Park,805,"Norman, Oklahoma",5

Denali,"The good and bad news is that there is only one road in and out. I think the best way to experience the park, apart from backpacking, which most folks aren't prepared to do, is to take a green bus one day to Eielson Visitor center or perhaps even further to the end of the road at Kentishna. You'll see plenty of wildlife and get the requisite photos but you also have a chance to see the terrain and plan a day hike for the next day. Next day you can ask the green bus driver to let you off wherever you want, make a day hike away from the road and be completely alone. When you make your way back to the one road, you simply flag down any eastbound green bus and return to the entrance (or your campground).","July 28, 2012",How to experience Denali,4,"Seattle, WA",5

The main lodge is quite nice, built with a 'great room' with a large central fireplace. The rooms are located in mini lodges around the property. The rooms themselves are tired and need to be renovated. The carpet in ours was stained and had started to fray at the seams.The main attraction is the famous Mt. McKinley. Unfortunately if the weather is poor, there is nothing to see and as was said earlier very little to do. There is a shuttle that takes you to the little town of Talkeetna (60 minutes each way for $10) which can be seen in less than an hour.If you choose to stay at the lodge then there are no options for food other than those restaurants (3) at the lodge and you are forced to pay their prices which seem high.","July 25, 2012",I Wouldn't Go Back!,45,"Toronto, Canada",2

Why bother with Deniali, which has few established hiking trails, you can only access by shuttle bus, and the park staff speak as if everyone were in kindergarten or had never been in a national park before when you could go to Yellowstone and the Tetons or Glacier, see excellent wildlife, do fabulous hikes, and not have to deal with the cruise crowds? Maybe someday I will come back and do some serious backcountry hiking. But, for a person interested in long day hikes, wildlife, great views, and getting away from crowds of people, I will take Yellowstone and the Tetons or Glacier or the North cascades any day. Unless you have time for serious backcountry, Denali is Disney World, or perhaps Animal Kingdom. Five stars if you are city folk. 5 stars if you are John Muir with some serious time available. 3 stars otherwise. There are many far better national parks.

Denali,"We were in the 30% that actually got to see the mountain. I've been trying to find the words to describe it and explain it to my family and friends. Like the Grand Canyon, it's very hard to come up with the right words. If you can, plan on a few days and a few different perspectives so you can be sure to see at least the base or the peaks sometime. Our best views were from Talkeetna, 60-70 miles away, because the mountain is so huge it's hard to get see from closer. The other best view was from our flightseeing tour from the plane. It's twice the size of the mountains of Colorado, and something I wish everyone could see in their lifetime. If you take the shuttle bus into the park to see it, there is a good view on a clear day at the Eislin Visitor's Center. I don't recommend going all the way to Wonder Lake unless it is a clear day and you will be guaranteed of the view at Reflection Lake. It's too long of a bus ride just to go to the lake and not get to see Mt. McKinley. You won't get back until close to 6 p.m. and it's way too long on that bus. You will feel like you've been on a school bus for 11 hours and not worth it. We were extremely lucky and got a great view from the Eislen Center, but it was very short lived because it got clouded over, which is very common in the summer.

Denali,"June 17, 2012We rented our 28' RV from http://greatalaskanholidays.com/. The RV was a 2012 model and very clean and nice. We spent the first night in the camper in the parking lot after a taxi ride from the airport.The next morning, after finishing the paper work, we left for Denali. The ride up was a little disappointing. But the closer we got to Denali the better the view. We stayed two night in Denali. Should have stayed a least one to two more nights. Two nights not enough time to see and hike. After leaving the park, we drove the entire length of the Denali Hwy(at 25mhp it took about 6 hours). I was a little scary at first and rough, but we would do it all over again. Well worth the rough ride. Better than going up to Fairbanks. After turning off the Denali Hwy., we turned right towards the town of Glennallen. Make sure you have lots of Gas at this point. After arriving in Glennallen, there are several places to get gas and nice place for groceries. The best spot for camping is 14 miles down the road from Glennallen at the Tolsona Wilderness Campground.(http://www.tolsona.com/) After doing the loop from Anchorage, Denali, then back to Anchorage, we drove on to Seward. Seward is a small, nice harbor town. The towns campground is large and nice and the place to stay. There is a lot to do here. After staying 3 night, we returned back to Anchorage. The return trip was probably the worst part of the trip. We wanted to be close in to Anchorage for the last night. We decided to park at a pull off on the highway up to Anchorage from Seward. Too much traffic to sleep. So in the middle of the night we moved to the Wal-mart parking lot in Anchorage. Another mistake! Can’t camp in the Wal-mart parking lot, City ordinance. So we spent the night in the parking lot next to Great Alaskan Holiday. Returned the camper the next morning and took a taxi downtown Anchorage and shopped until time to catch the plane home.

Denali's only road is a corker, and not for the acrophobic. Driver Omar Lantz was both a great driver and a fine guide, and made the entire excursion pleasant for all on this full bus. We saw grizzly bears, a porcupine, moose, and many caribou along the way (though wildlife are not guaranteed). Teh cose of $34 (plus park entrance fee of $10, if not already paid), seemed high, until I divided by 8 to get $4.25 per hour. But, bring a good lunch and a couple of bottles of water. The only places to get water are at the two ends of the ride, and food is not available at all on the trip. Mt. McKinley itself is a huge, glowing sight rising thousands of feet above its neighboring peaks, themselves impressively rugged, above the wide valleys of the park, some so flat as to have meandering streams flowing through them.

We had a very good driver with plenty of knowledge, she made it very interesting. We had the option of getting off the bus at any stop, but we chose to ride it without getting off, and that is what most on the bus did. We were lucky, we got to see, bear, moose, lynx, elk, fox, and mountain goats. I’m sure I missed some more animals. Don't expect the animals to be an arm’s length away, most are at a distance, but some were very close. The fox walked right by the bus, and the bears were less that 50 yards away. I could see how some people would be disappointed on the trip, since there is no guarantee to see animals. The scenery was beautiful and well worth the trip. Be prepared, it will be a very long day, and make sure if you take the shuttle you have your own food and water, there is nowhere to buy it on the trip.

But I was wrong! I think it probably has to do with your bus driver, though. Kim T was our shuttle driver and she was great! She has been driving the shuttle bus for 12 years! So she is very knowledgeable. She told us facts about the park, animals, and plants. She answered our questions, too. She's really good about spotting animals and made sure and stopped anytime that she (or any of us) saw anything. She gave us plenty of time to take pictures. We could have gotten on and off whenever we wanted and changed buses, but we stayed with Kim the entire 12 hours because she was such a good shuttle bus driver! It was definitely a long day, but I felt it was worth it. I don't think, however, that this is a tour for younger children. There was a couple with two children (approx 5 and 7) on our bus. The kids were VERY bored after the first 45 minutes. The kids weren't very well-behaved and wouldn't be quiet when we stopped to see animals. The parents opted to get off the bus at Eielson Visitors Center and catch another bus to go back to the entrance. Everybody on the bus was happy. :) We saw wildlife--some were pretty far away, but I was still happy. At the end of the day a momma bear and two cubs walked across the road. As to which shuttle to take....I really wanted to go all the way to Kantishna, but wouldn't do it a second time. BUT...I would still recommend it if you've never been to Denali before. Things to remember: Pack a lunch (or by pre-packaged sandwiches, chips, cookies, etc) in the visitor's center. Make sure and bring bug spray if you decide to go to Wonder Lake or farther. The mosquitoes will eat you up! Take binoculars.","July 4, 2012",Shuttle Bus,22,Virginia,5

Denali,"We took the 6:15am bus to Wonder Lake. Well worth it. The further we went into the park the more animals we saw. The scenery is breathtaking. We saw the summit inside the park. Saw 2 grizzly bears, one with cubs, carribou, wolve, fox. dall sheep, moose. There are plenty of stops to get out and hike or eat lunch and catch another bus going in further or returning to the visitor center. Highly recommend going all the way to Wonder Lake. It's a long day but with all the stops it goes by so fast. We actually saw the summit our first four days in Alaska and that's usually unheard of.","July 3, 2012",Wonder lake,59,"Winston Salem, North Carolina",5

It had a layer of clouds around it's halfway point, making it appear as if it was an entire mountain floating above the other mountains, really cool. Alas, it clouded back up by the time we got to Eielson VC, but since we missed it the first time we visited in 2008, it was great to just get a peek and some pics.

Denali,"We upgraded our tour from the Natural Wilderness to the Tundra when a friend told me we would see so much more wildlife taking the 8 hr tour. I'm so glad we did!! It helped we had an awesome driver, who had just the right amount of stories to not overdo it, but give you a clear picture of life(both human and wildlife) in the area. We also spotted moose, grizzlies, caribou, and dall sheep. (Our tour was on June 3....we left at 7:30 am and I'd recommend as early of tour as possible to catch as many animals as possible.) There was a passenger(a Texas hunter I believe) at the back of the bus who was uncanny in spotting the wildlife, so after a while the rest of us could just rely on him. Then the driver could zero in her camera on it and we could see it on our individual monitors.

Our driver was informative but way too passionate about the Terrain and country, unbelievable the amount of people who wanted to spend hours photographing mountain sheep, most of them were just specks on a mountain, they were sheep, we have millions in NZ and we eat them! If we had not been fortunate enough to see a grizzly bear up close and for quite a while, I would not have given the trip even 2 stars! We did not see much of anything of Mount McKinley, too much cloud, no-one is too blame for that but the number of times the driver stopped on the return trip to try and see the Mountain were mind boggling, just buy a postcard!We did not get back to the hotel till after 10.30pm and we had an early start next day. I was not impressed, maybe Holland America should have scheduled an earlier trip or maybe I should have researched it better and simply not have gone!This is remember, just my personal opinion, a lot of people on the bus loved it, I did not!

Denali,"I see many reviews here are of tours that you can do within the huge park. This review is about the experience of walking around the three or four facilities that are offered as standard, and is not about any ""tour"".Firstly, you cannot see the ""great"" mountain from here. You need to drive a long way, and have a clear day to see Denali. If you want to do that, you will be at the mercy of the weather. Only 30% of park visitors arrive on a day that is clear enough to see Denali. A shuttle bus is available that will take you between the Visitor Center, the Horseshoe Trail and the Wilderness Access Center and town. This shuttle bus operates from some lodges, certainly from the Princess Lodge, which is where I was staying. But we found the one hour circuit was a bit restrictive time-wise, and the distances are not great, so after arriving at the Visitor Centre we walked back and did the so called 1.5 hour walk to Horseshoe lake, and then back to the Access Centre where we watched a short documentary. We then walked back to the lodge. If you are reasonably fit, and the weather good, its a great walk. We sadly only saw one mouse (sadly not a moose) and one butterfly. The Horseshoe Lake walk was great, and we did not find it strenuous. There was a beaver dam at the very end, but no sign of the beavers. We are both mid 60, but fit and active.But you can have experiences here, and you need to stay very alert. A fellow on our tour was walking along, rather ""out of it"" on the path to the Riley Creek Camp Ground. Suddenly a baby moose only a few days old rushed across the road right in front of him. It was followed by a large bear, which looked like it might just be heading for him, so close was it. To be finally followed by a very cross mother moose. The bear got the baby moose and our friend was very shaken.","June 3, 2012",Review of the park facilities by foot,126,"Sydney, Australia",4

Of course the beer helped us remain stationary for so long, but it was still beautiful.

You're _legally_ required to do so, with a large fine if you don't. These bins aren't lockable... and every item we placed in the nearest bin was stolen.

It's now 16th October 2011 and we've received no response whatsoever, either to our suggestion that bins be lockable, with a refundable deposit; or to our claim for reimbursement, with receipts attached. This matter will be pursued, as it's a Catch22 situation: Ignore the requirement and you're fined; comply and suffer losses.

Denali,"There were so many things to do in the Denali area. We found out that booking ahead is a good idea as this place is very busy. No matter the cost, this trip was worth it. We stayed three days at Carlo Creek Cabins and found the cabins comfortable and rustic, dust included, loved it all. The next day we toured Denali Park, departing from the visitor center, bound for Wonder Lake. 86 miles, one way, 11 hours...not for the weak of heart. We had a great experience...viewed and photographed lots of wildlife. After having completed the full trip to Wonder Lake, on our next visit we will probably skip this part of the journey. We found that Wonder Lake was mostly enjoyed by mosquitos, BIG ones. Remember this is an old school bus, sometimes dusty, sometimes cool, but visually overwhelming the entire route. Be sure to take your own provisions, water, lunch and whatever you may need as there is nothing available except pure nature. In the evenings we found many small shops and restaurants in the area, the locals call Glitter Gulch. We found our best Halibut dinner at the Salmon Bake bar and grill. The fried shrimp was also very tasty. The seafood was very fresh and the beer was cold. Although we did not stay at the Princess Lodge, the lodge and restaurant area are overwhelming with high cliff top views of the glacial river.

Denali,"We never did see Mt McKinley/Denali due to the weather. The Tundra bus tour was 6-8 hours with scheduled stops every hour and half or so. The bus was nicer than the old school buses I had seen on the brochures, but just. We traveled I think 66 miles into the park, which took us about three and half hours. The scenery can be rather dramatic, especially around Sable Pass, but it is not as awe inspiring in my book as say the Rocky Mountains in either the lower 48 or Canada. The landscape is tundra - so plants are all short with some willows around the rivers. For scenery I would not say this is a top 10 destination.Having said that for wildlife it certainly is. We saw Dall Sheeo, Caribou, Red Fox, Lynx, Moose, and 7 Brown Bear, including a mother and cub wrestling in a meadow. It was a like national geographic! Most everything was easily viewable from the bus without binoculars, though for pictures and video a zoom is definitely in order. The Dall Sheep and Bear were the most distant, but were easily viewable with the naked eye and we got good pictures with our non-SLR type cameras.I highly recommend this tour if you want to see the park. The shorter tour (3-4 hours) only goes something like 25 miles into the park and they do not see much wildlife. In fact we spoke to several people who had taken that tour and without exception they all said they should have taken the longer Tundra tour.The bus driver is also your naturalist guide.

The village feel walking to and from the restaurant was far superior to that offered by Holland America's McKinley Chalet Resort, which had more of a mall effect.

We camped the first night at Riley Creek Campground (busy, lots of sites, not a good choice for tenters) and the rest of the time at Igloo Creek (only 7 sites, bear boxes provided, stream to get water but must treat). The bus was expensive ($31.50 per person), but once you're ""in"", you're ""in"". We were able to hail down any green bus and go to where we wanted to hike for the day, and hail another one to return to our campground. Busses were generally on schedule but one must allow for ""animal jams"" or sightings, and that we saw! Many grizzlies, moose, dall sheep, etc. Elison visitor center was lovely and worth a visit. Lovely hiking anywhere really, just tell the bus driver where you want to get off!

The bus was comfortable with TV screens that Joe could show what his video camera could zoom in on. Poor grammar, but you get my drift. The bus would stop every hour for a latrine break. There was a semi-panic when a mama bear and 2 cubs came within 100 yds of the people milling around. Mama took one look and retraced her steps with her kids trailing her. Lots of great photo ops!

They were walking down the road going by our bus, got some great video of this encounter. The only issue I had was the bus driver was not happy with our group as people were talking during these animal encounter, supposedly there is a rule that the animals shouldn't hear our voices. Funny thing is when you are hiking you are suppose to talk loudly to alert the bears that you are in the area. Everywhere else where I have encounter animals in National parks this is the first I have heard of the no talking rule.","August 30, 2011",Great for wildlife viewing,52,New England,4
Denali,"Took the 13 hour shuttle tour (Kantishna) through Denali National Park on the bus -- toooo long. Would recommend the six hour trip route. Most of the wildlife we saw was in the area traveled between the visitor center and Eielson. Incredibly informative bus driver, who could not only manuver those high crooked roads, but who also could also spot wildlife. However, I knew when she started to point out pintails and that's the only wildlife we had seen in three hourss, that she was stretching to find something for us. However, prior to and on the return from Eielson, we saw wolves, bears., caribou, moose and dahl sheep in abundance. Mount McKinley concealed itself from us that day and we only saw the base, but we had one heck of a snowstorm for 20 minutes that was beautiful and truly illustrated how quickly that mountain makes weather!","August 30, 2011",Denali National Park/Mt. McKinley,6,"Lexington, TN",4
Denali,"We took the shortest bus trip, and still got to see the north peak of McKinley, cow and bull moose, several Dall sheep at close range, a grizzly, a fox, a ptarmigan, and some other animals, all without leaving the bus. My only criticism is that the driver, one K. Kimura, was often slow to stop for the animals when we spotted them, and as we got closer to the end on the return trip, seemed to be in a big rush to get back to the terminal. The driving skill was great though, and I was glad it was him driving and not me, as the road gets very curvy and narrow, all dirt and gravel, with some big drops and no guard rail. Be sure you take enough food and water with you for the 6 hour ride, there is none to buy. There were sufficient rest stops to make miscellaneous pit stops unnecessary. Obviously, not an attraction for handicapped or mobility challenged folks.","August 28, 2011",Breathtaking encounter with nature,43,"Newton, Kansas",5
Denali,"We booked the Denali Backcountry Adventrue 13 hour, 90 mile trip which included lunch at Denali Wilderness Lodge (mile 90) through Denali Cabins. The bus wasn't fancy, but the driver (Mike) was extremely knowledgeable (PHD in Environmental History) and he was as into the wildlife (bear, caribou, moose, sheep) we saw as we were. He made the trip a total joy. We lucked out with a day that Denali was in full view - chances are less than 50/50 of seeing Denali due to weather. Denali Wilderness Lodge gave us a good lunch and activities including gold panning, nature walk, etc. I highly recommend going the whole 90 miles with a company that has well qualified driver/guides.","August 28, 2011",Amazing - Best Day of Three Week AK Trip,212,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Denali,"They don't tell you this until you get there, but there is only a slim chance of seeing the mountain since it is often wrapped in clouds even when the weather is nice. We were lucky though and got a great view -- from the Fairbanks airport! We spent three days in Denali Park, and travelled to mile 62 on the Park Road (you have to take a bus as private cars are limited in where they can travel). We saw plenty of wildlife and driving on the Park Road reminded me of Ice Road Truckers without the ice. There is a pass that goes along the rocky edge of a mountain that will make your stomach crawl. However, although the weather was partly cloudy and nice, we never saw the mountain. It stayed surrounded in clouds our entire visit. But, when we were flying out of Fairbanks and went to our plane at gate 4, there was the entire mountain in its full glory! Denali Park is beautiful and great for wildlife and hiking, but have low expectations if you are trying to view the mountain while there and keep an eye out for it while at the airport.","August 27, 2011","Slim chance of seeing it, but it is beautiful",7,"washington, dc",5
Denali,"This is one of the great national Parks, altho' we were lucky & had good weather. It had rained the 2 weeks before we got there so visitors then may have had a different opinion. The bus trip (we took the park service shuttle - much cheaper that the commercial ones and we saw the same things) is a must and the only way you can get deep into the park. We went to the Escalon (sp?) visitor center & had great views of the mountain and saw lots of animals... bear, moose, wolf, lync, fox, dall sheep etc. You can drive your car 15 miles into the park and this is well worth a half day. August is a little more rainy there, but the tundra was changing color and very pretty. There is not a lot of oragnized hiking trails, altho' you can get off the bus anywhere and get picked up later. A truly beautiful place.","August 25, 2011",One of the best,60,"San Francisco, California",5
Denali,"We experienced the full day bus tour 91 miles into the Park. Although it rained on and off all day we did see a lot of wild life. Grizzlies, Black Bear, Dall Sheep, Wolves, Moose, Cariboo, Hawks to name a few. We were constantly on the lookout for wildlife. Bring binoculars and cameras. The scenery is just amazing...glorious snow capped mountains, glaciers, tundra, woodlands, and rivers. This is Alaska at its best. The snacks provided kept us pretty full all day. You get to know your bus mates too as your full day adventure unfolds. My 10 year olds and 17 year old all agreed it was a better experience than they anticipated when I first told them it was a whole day tour.","August 22, 2011","a rare view of nature, wild and raw, largely untouched by humans",65,"Winnipeg, Canada",5
Denali,"Because of the near constant cloud cover in Denali National Park road, chances are you won't be able to see Mt. McKinley from Stony Outlook or Polychrome Pass. A real disappointment for most- and they nearly always turn around and head home with downcast heads and unopened camera lenses- but not for me. I came all the way out to Alaska to see McKinley so I decided to spend $350 on the McKinley Flightseeing Tour- and boy was it WORTH IT. Above the cloud cover, McKinley soars above the heavens and a clear sight of the summit was a sight worth seeing. McKinley is spectacular and the flightseeing tour was absolutely worth it.","August 22, 2011",See it through flightseeing- expensive but worth every penny.,88,"London, United Kingdom",5
Denali,"It was raining the day of my bus trip into the park. The windows of the bus fogged up inside and got spattered with mud outside, making if difficult to see out. I had booked an 11 hour trip to Wonder Lake, but wound up catching a returning bus about 4 hours into the trip since there was no chance to see Mt. McKinley reflected in the lake or otherwise due to the rain and clouds. On the return trip we saw a pair of grizzly bears, a bull moose and some caribou. That was very nice. The driver was informative and made sure to stop long enought for everyone to get their fill of viewing and picture taking.","August 21, 2011",Rain dampened the trip,109,"Knoxville, Tennessee",4

Denali,"We drove to Talkeeta AK (which reminds me of the town in Northern Exposure on tv years ago) from Anchorage to catch a Flight-See by K-2 Aviation.It was a perfect day to see Mt. McKinley, as 1 in 15 days are clear. The passenger planeheld 11 people and we flew up to 12,000 feet and took gorgeous photos.(McKinley is 20,000 feet) Then we landed on a 7,000 ft glacier, Mt. Eldridge , and spent 30 minutes of wonder actually standing on a glacier.The entire flights was about 1 1/4 hours and well worth the price. They even gave us snow boots on put over our shoes to walk on the glacier. An experience of a lifetime!","August 17, 2011",Flight-See to Mt. McKinley awesome,57,"Smithfield, North Carolina",5
Denali,"We were fortunate to have the clouds part and get a great view of Mount McKinley from the Eilson Visitor Center. Keep in mind that this is rare so have some patience and be prepared to stop and view McKinley from multiple locations over a couple of days. You can view McKinley from inside Denali park and outside. It is a gorgeous site. If you view McKinley from outside the park, don't be one of those idiots that stops their vehicle on the road to take a picture. It creates a traffic hazard and is very dangerous and even illegal in some places. Use the pullouts on the Parks Highway south of Denali.","August 15, 2011",Lucked out with great views of McKinley,193,"Pittsboro, North Carolina",5
Denali,"We used the park busses to tour the park starting our tour at 8:30 AM. Drivers stop so visitors can snap as many pictures as they wish. They also act as tour directors pointing out landmarks, animals and park history. We went as far as the Eilson Visitors Center and took the free Ranger Stroll around the center, which I recommend. The stroll takes almost an hour so after finishing the tour, you must ask a Ranger to be placed on a wait list to catch a different bus. We got on the first return bus at 2:20 with no wait. We heard that return trips after 4:00 have a much longer wait time.","August 11, 2011",Alaska must see! This is the place to see wildlife!,95,"Morrison, Illinois",5
Denali,We happened to be fortunate. We saw it for two days but it has its own weather pattern and it is usually cloudy in the area. Stay at the McKinley Princess.

Denali,"Beautiful scenery and snow capped mountains where ever you go! Mt. McKinley and the nearby glaciers were a magnificent work of art by nature. The best time to go is before the end of May when it's still the slow season. Normally in order to visit the national park, you have to take one of their tour buses and cannot drive your personal vehicles past the visitor center. However, since it was the off season, we were able to drive our own car up to 30 miles into the park. You can just park and hike anywhere. We saw tons of moose running around and lots of snow on the ground and in the distance. This part of Alaska is so beautiful and another benefit about going near the summertime is you have about 20 hours of daylight.","August 5, 2011",Denali Park in Alaska is Breathtaking,58,"Denham Springs, Louisiana",5

Beautiful varied scenery, lots of wiodlife, delicious lunch at the roadhouse, interesting talk by son of Iditarod winner, good snacks, several stops to stretch, and wonderful bus driver, who had raised four sons on a homestead in the wilderness. The highlight was rounding a curve to meet mama grizzly and her cub right next to the bus. We spent quite a while watching them much on grass, before they climbed up on the road and wandered away.

Denali,"Mount McKinley at 20,320 feet above sea level is the highest peak in North America; however, it is only the 116th tallest in the world as measured above sea level. The world's highest mountains measured above sea level are concentrated primarily in Asia with the second highest concentration in South America.But what makes McKinley special is that it has a larger bulk and rise than Everest. While the summit of Everest is the highest in the world at 29,029 feet, Everest's base starts at about 17,000 feet, giving it a real vertical rise of little more than 12,000 feet. McKinley's base is roughly at 2,000 feet, giving it a vertical rise of 18,000 feet.","August 23, 2010","The mighty McKinley, a beauty to behold",266,"Austin, Texas",5

This bus goes ~72 miles one way, so it is a long day. You need to bring food and drinks. We got back to our car around 5:30 pm. We would not change anything about our trip. We saw caribou, Dali Sheep, Eagles, Moose, Red Tail Fox & Grizzly Bears with several cubs. We traveled in our 5th wheel and stayed in Denali RV Park & Motel, which is ~5 miles outside the Park.","May 31, 2010",Words cannot describe its beauty,5,"Metairie, Louisiana",5
Denali,"Mt. McKinley is awe-inspiring. We've been to Alaska twice, and both times got to see it. Only about 20% of people coming to the park can see it from the ground-we were blessed to see it on our second trip. However, if you want to guarantee yourself a sighting, take a flight tour over the park-we did that both times-there are 65 & 75 minute fly-around options offered by several companies (we used Fly Denali & had a great experience) as well as through Holland America & Princess. You can also take a flight tour over the summit, which we did not do. also, many times on the shuttle or train to and from Anchorage you can see the mountain on a clear day.","August 10, 2009","""The great one"" is awesome",322,"Austin, Texas",5

Denali,"mckinley is nice close up but is actually better seen from a distance. polychrom pass is worth the trip the caribou or raindearcan be awsome. Listening to the river by princess lodge is very nice. You can pick blueberrys at wonder lake in season, but the mosquitos are fierce. I have been at least 3 times maybe more. the first time the buses had hard plastic seats and were free you could get on and off all day. now you have to pay to ride the buses but the seats are padded. The roads are windee you might bring some dramamine to prevent stomach upset. you will probably see moose you may also see grisly bear, goats, sheep at a distance, carabou up close, squirls, beaver, perhaps a wolf. The train ride is nice too if you ride in the upper glass cars it gets very hot on a sunny day, but i did see a grisley stand up on two legs from out of nowhere from the train. denali has presentations by park rangers which can be interesting.denali is the newer name for mckinley, i've been in anchorage since 1961 the old names die hard. mckinley is one of the best things to see in alaska. the seward sea life center and the adjacent waterfall are perhaps even better and take less time. then again i enjoy the fish hatchery on ship creek with its artificial waterfall and the salmon trying to jump over it. Watching the red and brown salmon swept backwards down river or creek after they have spawned is sad but interesting. Seeing an apple or cherry tree with fruit on it is very nice for those of us who don't get to see that sort of thing often and who would believe you could miss thunder. i still don't miss snakes though.","June 15, 2008",excelent camping with a beautiful view,6,"anchorage, alaska",5

Blessed with clear weather for the two days we stayed there, the views of Mt McKinley from the lodge are second to none. Mt McKinley is due west of the lodge, which makes sunrise the best time to photograph it. Shuttle buses go back and forth from the lodge to Talkeetna, where you can book a flight seeing tour to see the mountain up close and personal.

Denali,"Due to the fact that Mt. McKinley is so much higher than the surrounding mountains, it actually creates its own weather and is often shrouded in clouds. The park rangers in Denali never seemed to grow tired of reciting the statistic: only a third of all visitors to the park ever get to actually see the mountain.It would be difficult to use my visit to the park as an example, though. As I was driving north from Anchorage towards Denali the mountain was shrouded with clouds, but as I got closer to the park they melted away. Through the remainder of my visit of several days not once could I not see the mountain due to clouds. The day of my departure clouds covered the mountain once again. This coincidence not only afforded me far too many opportunities for great shots of the mountain, but also allowed a very special experience.I was on a discovery hike with a ranger climbing up Cathedral Mountain. The climb up was interesting, with the rangers commentary on the geology of the mountain, Dall sheep, and my cousins discovery of a large gem like rock, but the real treat was the discovery of a mountain trail, blazed by the Dall sheep who traverse the cliffs. At first I was hesitant to make the crossing to the opposite ridge because of the forty five degree angle slope on either side of the foot-wide trail, but eventually I bravely edged across. I’m glad I did. Over the ridge was a spectacular view of the whole Savage River Valley, and on the horizon, the majestic Mt. McKinley.","January 6, 2007",Spectacular- if you can see it,328,"Boston, Massachusetts",5
