Big Room,"Most people think about bringing water and cameras, but, a very important item is a good flashlight. One of the new style LED lights is very important to be able to see many of the beautiful structures. I used a 1000 lumen light and it was very adequate. The Big Room is an incredible natural structure to behold.","October 15, 2019",Minimum item to bring-a good LED flashlight,14,"Fort Myers, Florida",5
Big Room,"I have dreamed about seeing Carlsbad Caverns since I was a child. The National Park Service has done a fantastic job of making this national treasure easily accessible to most visitors, some parts wheelchair accessible, too. We walked both the long path and the next day the shorter path. Definitely much more to see on the longer route. Most of the walk is easy to do (I have some ankle instability issues); good footwear is a must, but hiking boots not necessary. There was one small section that was uphill and a bit slippery, but good handrails helped me to get through safely. We also did the King's Palace tour which was excellent (book ahead, it fills up). You can buy postcards either at the visitor center or below at the snack area and have them rubber stamped at the snack area downstairs ""mailed from 750 ft. below the surface. They also sell postcard stamps.","October 14, 2019",Go! You will love it!,111,"Denver, Colorado",5
Big Room,"Around 2 hours from El Paso. In New Mexico. There is an immigration checkpoint on the way so will be a good idea to keep documents.Going down the caverns is about 10-12K steps atleast. There are a no. of benches on the way for resting. For people who could not continue half way, there was help. The structures formed by dripping water, acid were very beautiful.Inside can become cold. Is best to have a light jacket.there are elevators for return trip ( or even coming down)","October 13, 2019",Caverns,15,"Halifax, Canada",4
Big Room,"I had been looking forward to this visit for years. Half of the lights were not working (a recent lightning strike according to a ranger). The other lights were very dim, which made it extremely difficult to see the beauty of the big room. I was glad I had my flashlight with me to be able to see what I could.","October 7, 2019",Disappointed,109,"Cumming, Georgia",3
Big Room,"Really hard to describe, underground 750ft.. limited lights.. big space.. unworldly - yet... magnificent!! R'member, the area around is open, sky above and see for miles and miles. Pls, enjoy! ","October 1, 2019",Awesome!,46,"Utica, Michigan",5
Big Room,"If there is one place you want to go it is the “big room”. I have never been in a cavern before and I was very,very impressed! You can shorten your tour by just doing the big room or go thru the entire system for the same price. National Park pass gets you and a guest in for free","September 27, 2019",Don’t miss it,18,"Webster, New York",5
Big Room,Clearly marked signs told the length of path options and what parts were accessible for people in wheelchairs. I ended up taking the full path rather than shortcut. It took me less than an hour. Very cool views. A little spooky with lighting effects so hard to get full effects with photos. At end of day snack bar is limited.,"September 22, 2019",Stunning views,70,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5
Big Room,"We got there after 8 am and tours begin at 8:30 am. was not crowded. I like this cave because it offers the self guided tour of the Big room and you can stroll at your leisure and take time looking at everything. We did not take the Natural Cave Entrance because they said it was very steep and took 1 hour to walk down to the Big Room. We chose the elevator to go down 750 feet to the Big Room. I love this cave better than Mammoth. It is cool in the 50's down there and is an easy walk. Wheelchairs only allowed at certain points. Trails are well marked and low light. As we got to the end before taking the elevator back up, we partially walked up the Natural Cave Trail which was getting steep but was not as beautiful as walking through the big room. I am glad we took the elevator. Not recommended for people scared of the dark or have a difficult time walking.I would recommend you take a flash light with you so you can see everything better. We spent 2 hours on the self guided tour and did not rush.","September 19, 2019",Always the best - Don't forget your flash light,39,"Leesburg, Florida",5
Big Room,"So awesome! See our review under Giant Dome.This was very frightening for our disabled son. We had to wait 15 minutes to enter the Caverns so his eyes could adjust to the dark. He really didn’t completely get comfortable, but was able to walk through the Big Room.","September 13, 2019",Family With Physical Disabilities ,30,"Valdosta, Georgia",5

Big Room,After I did the Natural entrance and the Kings Palace tour I did the Big Room self guided tour. If you bring your camera you'll be stopping constantly. It is absolutely amazing.,"September 7, 2019",The main reason to come here,97,"Gilroy, California",5
Big Room,"We took the elevator down to tour the Big Room. There was a shortcut available but we didn’t take it. Spent about 1.5 hours down in the cavern. It was cool and damp. There was illumination and hand rails all the way through. I had no trouble in Crocs flips flops. There were some steep inclines in places, and we encountered a few people who were struggling a bit. But overall a fairly easy walk. Benches are placed sporadically along the path. ","September 5, 2019",Wonderful stop for a few hours!,20,"Winston Salem, North Carolina",5
Big Room,"The Big Room is so nicely trailed. It's very easy to walk around and admire all the amazing formations. It's a room unlike anything else you'll ever see. The vastness of it will blow you away. You can choose to hike down into it (easy, we did) or ride the elevator down. Then can you choose to hike up out of it or ride the elevator to the top (which what we did). There is a small snack bar and rest area down there, but don't expect much in the way of snacks. Plenty of places to sit and rest though. A great place to visit, and you can see it all in a couple hours.","September 3, 2019",Stunning,153,"Dallas, Texas",5
Big Room,"You'll never see as grand a cavern in the Americas! Very well developed and accessible pathways, and the visitor's center is great, too! There is a sandwich shop down in the entrance to the cavern for those who get hungry during their visit.","August 25, 2019",You'll never see anything like it!,12,"Dallas, Texas",4
Big Room,We have toured caverns in the past but this is my favorite for sure. It’s self guided so you go at your own pace. Very well laid out with easy walking and hand rails. I only wish my camera could capture the enormity of the caverns. It’s so hard to properly describe the shapes and forms and caves. It took us close to two hours to walk through and this was the short version. We are both 60+ so it was plenty for us. But I was so tempted to take the long route. Lol. Wear comfortable shoes and a light jacket. It is cold and damp 750ft under the surface. I was in awe at natural beauty that lies beneath. ,"August 12, 2019",Very cool. Literally ,18,"Emory, Texas",5
Big Room,"We are from Iowa so of course this came up when looking for something to do on our trip here. At first I wasn’t sure about all the walking for my 2 year old. I knew my 9 and 10 year olds would be fine. I had to carry my 2 year old through the whole thing, she was scared of the cave, but I’m still glad we came. Just the drive there up the mountain was amazing. Prices are affordable, only $15. My pictures on my phone and camera didn’t turn out. But definitely a must see if you’re visiting or live here. We took water with and it was a great way to beat the heat. ","August 8, 2019",Amazing experience!,7,"Mason City, Iowa",5
Big Room,"The big room at Carlsbad is like no other cave I have ever seen and is truly spectacular. The room itself is huge but, despite the incredibly humid air, has very little water which is unusual for a cave with so many water-based formations. The number of huge stalactites, stalagmites and columns that tower over you as you go around is almost unbelievable. I have never seen a cave as impressive as this - if you are visiting New Mexico this is a ""must see"" and well worth the long drive from Albuquerque or Santa Fe.The path around the cave is rough concrete so it is not at all slippery when wet and most of it, except for a section at the end of the cave with steep slopes, is wheelchair accessible and we met several people in wheelchairs taking full advantage of this! I would also recommend the walk down from the natural entrance. The path is similarly well maintained, not slippery when wet although it is quite steep in places and there is nothing quite like the sense of descending into the depths of the earth inside a massive cavern.","August 7, 2019",Spectacular,20,"Edmonton, Canada",5
Big Room,"Difficult to put a scale on its size , football field maybe. Just go and see magnificent it really is.","July 23, 2019",It’s Big.,225,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",5
Big Room,"As we entered the ""BIG ROOM"" we were all just amazed at the natural sites that unfolded. My youngest son wanted pictures of all the formations. He loved the ""bacon"" stalactites, and the columns. The entire family enjoyed the cavern tour and we were just a little tired after completing the entire loop around the Big Room!! It is well worth the time spent and the temperature was also very nice!","July 22, 2019",Awesome adventure,1,"Newton, Kansas",5
Big Room,I've been in many caverns over the years and they aren't kidding when they say this is the 'Big Room' - be prepared to walk! There is so much to see and its just amazing. It was fun to see and we enjoyed our walk through the room. ,"July 17, 2019",'Big Room' is really a Big Room!,27,"Richmond, Virginia",5
Big Room,"The self-guided tour is the must-do for this whole monument. From the bottomless pit to the bashful elephant, you need to experience the incredible age and size of these speleothems ( = stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and any-and-all other cave formations)! The trail is over a mile long, and you can rent an audio guide (which we didn't) if you choose. I remember visiting as a kid and having the audio guide, and I thought it was so cool! So, kiddos might really enjoy learning about the cave that way.","July 14, 2019",You can't NOT do this,7,"Austin, Texas",5
Big Room,"This is one of those places that if you have the ability to travel at all, you MUST see for yourself!Mom wont do long walks anymore, and I didn't have the time to research before we visited. But if I had known they have a lower deck gift shop and snack bar that Mom could have waited for me at after riding the elevator into the cave. I would have hiked in the natural entrance and met her there., since I didn't know, and didn't prepare. (failing to prepare, is preparing to fail.) we both rode the elevator in and out and I managed to get Mom to hike the whole cave through. SO amazing! Incredibly easy to explore with a fantastic paved trail!  I travel with my Mom and shes not too stable anymore. I watch her every step now fearing a fall, its SO nice to have such a easily accessible natural wonder!Do what you can to get here! Your soul requires it.","July 12, 2019",A GIANT hole in the ground,169,"Toledo, Washington",5
Big Room,I am so happy that we went to the Caverns. It was breathtaking. I would go here again in a heartbeat.,"July 4, 2019",Beautiful!,6,,5
Big Room,"We walked down from the cave entrance, which was a little taxing on my knees as the trail is somewhat steep in places, but well worth the effort as it gives you a real feel for how deep the cavern is. The Big Room has plenty to see, and that part of the trail is two loops, one long and one shorter, so you can spend an hour, or you can cut that time in half. It was a little cool for the grandkids, with one complaining of the cold, so be sure and take warm jackets just in case. We rode the elevator back up, of course!","June 25, 2019",A Must See!,45,"Abilene, Texas",5
Big Room,Beautiful room that you get to near the end of your journey through the caves. So worth the walk. The lighting brings it all into view and you can just imagine the looks on the faces of those who discovered it many years ago.,"June 25, 2019",Fantastic,197,"Toronto, Canada",5

Big Room,"Be prepared to be mesmerized by the grandeur of the Big Room at Carlsbad Cavern National Park. For me, it is like being in a giant, majestic cathedral and exploring the lunar surface. A winding path over a mile long leads from one unique formation grouping after another, many of which are named in a whimsical manner that is entirely suitable to that particular formation. Take a light jacket and wear good walking shoes. There’s some up and down and twists and turns to the pathway. Take your time and take it all in. It’s a natural wonderland and a must see!","June 18, 2019",Out of this World!,42,"Texas Gulf Coast, Texas",5
Big Room,"My family, including my teenager, were awestruck by the big room and the rest of the caves. It is an easy walk, and I believe, wheelchair accessible. You can take your time walking around. We loved it. Also, very cool temperature; a break from the heat.","June 14, 2019",Truly awesome,1,"Kelowna, Canada",5
Big Room,"This is the main tour of the Caverns. It is self-guided. It can be reached by using the elevators, or by hiking down the Natural Trail. There are lots to see. Dress warmly. ","June 14, 2019",multi-hour self-guided tour,17,"Mickleton, New Jersey",4

Big Room,This place is amazing! The sheer magnitude in size blows you away! One cannot imagine how big and how much beauty lies inside and underground! The first time get yourself the guided tour as you will be able to learn everything you need to know about the caves. There are desvíalas events where you can see the bats in flight. ,"June 1, 2019",Must visit! ,7,"Chandler, Arizona",5
Big Room,"As we planed our trip to New Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns was at the top of our list. My wife and I did our research and we had a great time exploring.After we arrived at the Visitor Center, we rented 2 audio guides at the Bookstore for $5 each. The audio guides give you much more information that you can read on the signs through out the cave. The are also very easy to use, just hit the number on the keypad corresponding the to the sign on the trail and listen.The only problem we had was reading the keypad in the darker areas of the cave. The flashlight on our phones worked well lighting this up.And once in the cave, put your phone in airplane mode. There is no signal in the cave and you want to save your battery for the flashlight.For us, walking down the Natural Entrance took a little over an hour. We took our time to enjoy the different areas as we went down. One thing that I have not seen mentioned are the people going up to the Natural Entrance. All these people that we meet going up were running or going as fast as they could. Be carful in the darker areas when you meet runners heading to the top.It was around 11 when we arrived at the Big Room. It is so much more that we were expecting. All I can say is that you must experience the Big Room to understand why it is so special.The lighting has much to do with it. The audio guide told us that instead of lighting the entire Big Room in bright lights that they brought in a Broadway lighting expert. This way the special features are lighted to bring out the best they have to offer.We spent close around 2 hours exploring the Big Room. It was not crowded, and we never felt rushed. Plus, we would run into a park ranger through out the Big Room. They would answer any questions and point out things that you may have missed.If you want to have lunch, there is a small choice of packaged food next to the Great Room. I would recommend taking the elevator up to the visitor center and eating freshly prepared Mexican food in the cafeteria. We had a great time exploring Carlsbad Caverns. Why did we wait so long?","May 27, 2019",Why Did We Wait So Long To Come?,370,"Catlin, Illinois",5
Big Room,"Went here as a child, took my own children here and took my new husband here. There is nothing like the Caverns, especially the Big Room. In the past I walked into the Cavern. Since I’m now in my 70s, we used the elevator both directions. Still impressive! ","May 25, 2019",Always a mind blower,34,"Boise, Idaho",5

Big Room,The national park service has done a great job making the caverns accessible to all. There is an elevator for those who don’t want to walk to the natural entrance. There are restrooms in the caverns. There are paved walkways. The big room is awesome. Don’t skip this. There is a long and a short walk around the big room. Take the long walk if you can manage it. Go!!,"May 19, 2019",Awesome,74,"Towanda, Pennsylvania",5
Big Room,"There is no place else like the big room. I thought the walk down from the natural entrance was good, but was losing a bit of interest because of the overwhelming number of cave formations. The big room reinvigorated my excitement, with new and beautiful sights around every bend of the path. Along the way, a few signs help explain what you see. There were a few rangers patrolling the area and one in particular was friendly and kind enough to point out some of the ""secret"" things to look for. At a leisurely pace I was able to walk the whole thing in a little more than an hour, stopping periodically to take pictures. There's a gift and snack shop near the elevators and rest rooms. This was a very enjoyable experience that is highly recommended.","May 10, 2019",Absolutely incredible!,14,,5
Big Room,Plan to spend around 2 hours walking down from the main entrance and around the big room. Spend some time at the bottom at the gift/snack shop. Take the elevator back up. Hope you took lots of pictures!,"May 9, 2019",Massive and Beautiful,85,"Green Valley, Arizona",5
Big Room,"This is another self guided walking tour of a cave, but it's got lots to see and it's doable. If you do the Kings Palace tour then this cave is right close to the start of the other tour. There is a restaurant area down in the caves if you want to get something to eat there but you aren't allowed to carry anything into the cave itself. And there are restrooms down in that area as well.","April 28, 2019",A good one to see,12,"Roseburg, Oregon",4
Big Room,"You can either enter through the elevator or the natural entrance which I’d recommend. Entering through the natural entrance and passing the twilight zone to make your way towards absolute darkness brings in a sense of humility and I couldn’t help but wonder how it must have felt for the first speleologists. Overall the big room offers a remarquable range of speleothems and stalactites in all shapes and sizes and in great density in places. Some look like lion tails other like mushrooms while other ones look like baleen. You can find much more wonderful structures as you walk around the cool and humid room. Highly recommend the experience and if you are a hiker I’d suggest climbing the highest point in Texas, the Guadalupe peak 45min drive from the caverns.","April 28, 2019",Magical and out of this world ,11,"Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico",5
Big Room,"We took the elevator up and down and then just walked around the big room, it was spectactular! So many weird formations to see. We had no wait for the elevator and never felt rushed. Parts of the route are wheelchair accessible. ","April 24, 2019",otherworldly,42,,5
Big Room,"Massive and impressive. We arrived on ""free"" day and the caverns were mobbed. The elevator line was 2 hours, but we enjoyed walking up the ""natural entrance"" instead. If you ever near Sonora Texas want a more intimate and slightly more ""magical"" experience, check out the Crystal Palace Tour at Sorora Caverns.","April 24, 2019",Impressive,68,Boston,5
Big Room,"I have been to several caves/caverns in the past, but this one is truly amazing. It's huge and has so many interesting things to see. We walked down from the natural entrance instead of taking the elevator. I wish we had taken the elevator now, because it would have given us more time in the actual cave itself. The walk down certainly gives you an impression of how the early spelunkers must have felt, but for those of us that live in the flat lands of the Midwest, it was a bit tough to hike down. :) We got there around 2:30 and it took a little over an hour to walk down and they close the cavern around 4:30 - so, not as much time to explore as I would have liked. But what we saw was really breathtaking. Don't miss it.","April 6, 2019",Amazing!,10,Michigan,5
Big Room,"We hiked down from the Natural Entrance and you end that hike here. You can also take an elevator down that brings you to the start of the 1.25 mile Big Room self-guided your. This starting area also has restrooms and snack shop. The Big Room has informational signs and paved, mostly level trail. There is a shortcut option but it wasn’t that much longer to do the whole loop. It really shows the enormity of the caverns. The Big Room is the equivalent of 14 football fields. A definite must do! We were there on a weekday morning and it was not crowded at all. No wait for an elevator back to the top. ","April 4, 2019",Definitely see the Big Room,66,"Clive, Iowa",5

Big Room,Started the visit with a 2-hour left cave tour which was a small cave compared to the big room.The big room was awesome and we just walked by ourselves with no audio or human guide. Took lots of pictures on my GoPro in night mode otherwise it’s too dark for GoPro video and my iPhone camera. Got to the big room at 9 am on Friday 3/29/2019 and the place was virtually empty. Lots of people arrive after 10 am.Highly recommend going in there when they open at 8 am to get the place all to yourself at least on a weekday.,"March 31, 2019",Awesome cavern,72,"Downey, California",5
Big Room,The Big Room is hands down the best part of Carlsbad Caverns. The beauty of the formations will leave you at a loss for words. Do the whole Cave if you can but if not make the Big Room your priority. You can take the Shortcut Trail which will shorten the distance you need to walk and you’ll still see the best parts of the Big Room. This area is mostly flat and the cave is cool so bring a jacket.,"March 29, 2019",Otherworldly experience ,489,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Big Room,This cave is famous because of its size! If walking is difficult for you there is a shortcut and you could take an elevator up and down and skip the natural entrance. You would not need very much time if you do that but you will get to see quite a bit.

Big Room,We did the self guided tour walking down from the walk in entrance and around the big room. We also did the Kings Palace tour. Don’t know if I would do the Kings Palace tour again. It was interesting but not that much different then the big room. Only complaint was the 30-40 minute wait to catch the elevator back up. It was a weekend and Spring Break and only had two of the four elevators running.,"March 11, 2019",Amazingly huge ,2,"Spring, TX",5

You can get an audio, self guided tour, but all the major formations like the Lion's Tail and Giant's Dome and MANY others are described on the placards around the big room.

Big Room,"What an amazing National Park! We are big into junior ranger badges/programs and this one was hands down one of the harder booklets. It’s a sign that the people who made it (all rangers from Carlsbad) really want people to leave this natural wonder with knowledge. The exhibits in the main building were informative and thorough. There were plenty of Rangers available to answer questions and help enhance your experience. We chose to the the natural entrance walk in - it took us an hour to walk to the base of the cavern where the elevators, big room and snack bar are located. Along the way there were plenty of informational signs talking about formations and bats. If you opt to use the elevator to descend you will see similar informational signage in the big room.There was ample parking available for larger vehicles/RVs. And they have a dog kennel on site. There are two gift shops: the one on the left as you walk in the front door has more commercial items and the one on the right is more National Park focused - also there is no tax on the Park run store. You can send mail from 750 ft below the surface! They have a mailbox located in the snack bar at the base of the elevators. If you tell the attendant you would like to have a stamp on your mail they will stamp it with a note that says it was mailed from 750 feet below ground.

Big Room,"We have had Carlsbad Caverns on our wish list for several years. We were not disappointed!! We drove in from Roswell and did the Big Room in the afternoon before we checked into our hotel in Carlsbad. I HIGHLY recommend renting the self guided hand-held microphone available for $5 in the bookstore. My husband and I each got one and loved having the information available! Caution: be sure to use the rest room (there is one by the elevator down near the big room) before heading into the Big Room. It took us just under 2 hours -- you could probably do it faster if you wanted to -- we really enjoyed taking photos and listening to the recording devices we had rented. It is dark in the Big Room, with many of the formations the formations lite up. the formations lite up. the formations lite up. The price is SO reasonable and the experience is amazing.

Big Room,"I've been to other caves in the US before and thought I had a fairly accurate idea what the caves would be like, but it's definitely an amazing experience in person that can't really be appreciated through photos. We came near the end of the day... as other reviewers have noted... ideal to perhaps go earlier and avoid the crowds.We came later to also see the bat flight program which was okay... but the bats were still coming out after 30 mins which is a LONG time to sit and watch.When leaving, they had 1/4 elevators working... so it was over an hour wait to get out of the caves.

It is my understanding that the water table has changed so very few of the formations in the tour areas are continuing to grow because there is no longer water flowing down them.

You do say ""Oh Wow"" a lot. Lots for formations. It's a comfortable climate. We had jackets along but didn't really need them but take one along if you chill easily. They have a restaurant, museum and gift shop so allow two or three hours to see it all, maybe longer if you do the guided tour.","October 16, 2018",This is a must see,31,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Big Room,"The Big Room is the focal point of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Located 750 feet below the Visitors Center, a paved 1.25 mile trail takes visitors on a self-guided tour around this massive cavern room. At 4,000 feet long and 625 feet wide, it's the fifth largest chamber in North America and the twenty-eighth largest in the world (in case you're wondering, the top 4 in North America are all in Mexico).The best way that I can describe my experience in the Big Room is that I felt like I was exploring Moria (the dwelling of the Dwarves in Lord of the Rings). The National Park Service has done a phenomenal job with the lighting in the cave. Every decision seems to accentuate the natural beauty of the place perfectly. Having said that, prepare to be absolutely amazed by what you see, but don't expect to get amazing photographs. I've never been somewhere where capturing an image of natural beauty is as difficult as it is here due. The lighting is perfect for viewing, but you'd need a very special camera (or a very particular set of skills) to be able to adequately capture the mystique of the Big Room. The paved trails are wide with very gradual inclines and descents. Some areas are pretty slick due to water/moisture in the cave, so make sure to wear slip-resistant shoes. Most of the Big Room is handicap accessible, but there is a section that is not. There are restrooms and a cafe available just outside the Big Room.Audio tours are available for a small fee, but since I didn't choose that option, I can't speak about the quality of that. If you have a lot of time, or have been to the caverns before and want to get a slightly different experience, it would probably be a cool option.This was my first visit to Carlsbad Caverns, but I have visited Mammoth Cave before. My opinion is that Mammoth Cave wins the overall battle between the parks since it has more cave trails to explore and more guided tour options. However, the Big Room easily beats any specific room or cavern that Mammoth Cave has to offer, including the Rotunda.I noticed that several reviewers included a review of the Natural Entrance with their Big Room review, but I will save that for my Natural Entrance review. Just know that you can get to and from the Big Room by elevator, and that the Natural Entrance is just an option for those interested in a more challenging entrance or exit to the cavern.","October 13, 2018",Indescribably Stunning,199,"Lafayette, Indiana",5

The natural lighting of non-colored lights enables one to envision faces, animals, and other objects in the rocks. Wear good, comfortable shoes and take a jacket to enjoy the 56 degree temp.

My feet were killing me because of my poor choice of shoes, but I would not trade the experience of the long drastic slope walk down for a ride on the elevator. To really appreciate the cavern, you need to see the whole thing. But since the Big Room is the best room, make sure you allow plenty of time to get down. If your time is limited or you are not physically active, you probably will have a better experience if you ride the elevator.

Big Room,"The Big Room is the main cavern in Carlsbad Caverns. You can walk down through the natural entrance or you can take the elevator. I'm a fat grandma with a 7 year old so we took the elevator, an experience in its self as you descend 750 ft! You can rent these headphones for the self guided tour. We didn't. There are lots of rangers around to ask questions. The first part of the walk is 1/2 mile, paved, level, good for anybody in a wheelchair or a scooter, or who has problems with their feet. (No strollers allowed, so put the toddlers on your hip! ). At the 1/2 mile point you can choose to go back, or keep going another mile. We kept going. This second part is not for the mobility impaired! The path is uneven, steep in areas, not nearly as much to see. We were so tired by the end, I wish we had gone back at the 1/2 mile point. If you are young and in good shape though, go for it! It's really worth it just to see the Bottomless Pit . Pretty unsettling. Be sure and bring a flashlight. You can also take flash pictures. It's a little chilly down there so bring a jacket. It's also very humid, wet actually. There is a bathroom down there, be sure and go before you leave on the tour, because there is no where else to go along the way. Only water is allowed on the trail. There is a small gift shop and snack bar . Save your money for better selections in the main gift shop and the restaurant at ground level. If you have a kiddo with you have them do the Jr Ranger booklet. It teaches them alot about the caverns and surrounding area, and keeps them engaged.

Big Room,"This was my 4th visit with the first being a guided tour in the 1950s. The use of self-guiding tours has resulted in damage to some of the cave features in the Big Room, especially along the paths, but it is still an impressive sight. The use of ""excluder"" rails and some signage has made it possible for the handicapped to tour parts of these incredible caves by use of the elevators rather than walking down from the natural entrance (still the preferred route - and a Rangers' knowledge is an important adjunct so if you have not been on a ranger-guided tour, you should sign up for it). The Ranger-guided tour also helps minimize the effects of persons directly behind you using high brightness flashlights to briefly illuminate areas where you are standing, making it more difficult (and arguably less safe) to walk without a light of your own. The random flashlight intrusions also decrease the ""feeling"" of the cave making it more like an evening walk than a truly unique experience. It also seems that over the years, the caves have become drier than they were in the past (fewer pools and less humidity). On earlier visits a jacket was really needed, now, I carried one in my small pack but never used it. Perhaps the airlocks installed at the elevators have helped to decrease this drying effect and the drought probably has not helped matters either. Nevertheless if you are anywhere near this park, to not go would be a mistake as the caves are still amazing even though they have felt the impact of years of touring. There are still some ""ups and downs"" in the caves so if you are seriously out of shape or have joint issues you may not want to go down the natural entrance to the Big Cave. Consult a Ranger if you are not sure.","July 30, 2018",A bit drier than in the past,51,"Corrales, New Mexico",4

It is not the normal paved path. It is literally the cave floor. The tickets for the regular entrance is good for three days. After our tour, we did a self-guided tour of the Big Room.

The restaurant in the low season served pre-made sandwiches and salads, not amazing, but filling enough, and fun to say you ate in a cave.

Big Room,"We were so happy to hear that the elevator (singular) was working because reviews on this page indicated they had been out of service all week. I use a cane and that would have been a disaster- we came all the way from California! I could never make it down and up 800 feet and a 20 percent grade, which is what you must do without the elevators to take you to the cave floor.I came to Carlsbad Caverns when I was a child and brought hubby this time as he had never seen it. It is unbelievable to see all the formations and learn how old the caves are.We did the self-guided tour through the Big Room. I walk with a cane and cannot walk far, but did fine walking throughout the whole trail in the Big Room. Took us 1 hour and 45 minutes. We bought the $5 self audio tour but I would say save your money. It mostly tells you things that are already written on the signs right in front of you. Also lame fake chatter between the two narrators: “Wow Jane can you believe how big this Room is?” Silly, I do not need to listen to that.There were hardly any other people in the caves this morning - we practically had the Big Room all to ourselves!

The Big Room has to be the best of the best, but there were surprises at every term. If you can visit, you owe it to yourself. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 is because all elevators were out when we got there. Without the elevator, the hike at a 45 or 50 degree angle straight up was slow and painful. We had booked a tour, but after arriving was told because all of the elevators were out, we would not make it down in time. When asked why we didn't know, the ranger stated an email went out to everyone who had a tour booked. We did not receive that email until three days after we returned from the trip. It all worked out because we were free to go and walk where ever we wanted to. We spent almost five hours in this amazing place.

The Things To Do page here on TA is littered with different formations you will find on the self guided tour, so don't worry about picking and choosing which of those to see - you will see them all. Also make sure you hike the Natural Entrance down and take the elevator out. This is the only way to truly see all of these magnificent Caverns.

Big Room,"For those who like caves, this is the best! Awesome - that’s all I can say. We were here Mar 12, with early spring break travelers, so this was a very busy place. The parking lot was pretty congested. Be prepared for long lines. We took the elevator down for the self-guided tour. The path through the cavern is paved, well-lighted and clearly delineated. The Big Room is huge and beautiful. Signage along the path gives good information. We spent about 1-1/2 hr in the cavern. Because the up-elevator line was so long,we opted to walk up the Natural Entrance Trail. When staff tell you it’s the equivalent of an 80-story 20% incline, they aren’t joking. It was very strenuous. If you want the ranger-guided tour of the King’s Palace you should reserve early. We couldn’t get tickets for that tour.

Big Room,"A MUST-SEE destination. Definitely take the Natural Entrance as you get a better perspective of the cave’s dept and see the entrance with bats flying around. The rangers estimate it takes 45 min – 1 hour to walk the Natural Entrance. We were in a hurry to make the 10:00 AM King Palace tour, so kept a steady pace down with no rests and did it in about 40 minutes. Several areas to rest on the way down. It is a steady 20-degree decline and drops about 750’.Do not do if need cane to walk. Need to be in decent physical shape but not necessarily in good shape.If have time, I would highly recommend a guided-tour(s) as you learn very much from the rangers in addition to the self-guided Big Room Tour (It is larger than 6 football fields and could house Notre Dame Cathedral). Both of the rangers on the guided tours were VERY educational and interesting. We did the Kings Palace and Left Hand Tunnel.Cool at the bottom.

Walking around the Big Room, it took us 1 hour and 15 minutes to stop at the points of interest and listen to the audio-tour guide. (It took us the same amount of time to do the Natural Entrance.) We really enjoyed being on this self-guided tour as we often had periods of time when we were just by ourselves and could experience the quiet of the cave. After having done the large group King's Palace tour in the morning, it was nice to be by ourselves. We both felt that the cave formations in the Big Room were just as spectacular, if not more so, compared to the formations seen on the King's Palace tour.

Big Room,"We really enjoyed the tour of the Big Room. There are all kinds of amazing formations here. We took around 300 pictures here. Flash photography is permitted, but we found that in many cases the non-flash pictures looked better. In any case, we were really impressed with everything we saw. We went on a weekday afternoon in February, and there were very few other people there, so it was peaceful. At times we felt as though we were the only ones there. It's interesting to imagine what it was like for the first explorers who had only lanterns and candles (and no pathway).There is lighting in the cave to help you see the path and to highlight many of the formation. Even so, it is dark and a bit damp. Even though your eyes will adjust to the darkness, there are still some places where it is hard to see the path.

Big Room,"We flew to and stayed overnight in El Paso because it was less expensive and only a 2.5 hour drive. I feel like it's really important to read as many reviews on this place as possible as there are quite a bit of tips to follow to improve upon the journey. #1- take a guided tour if possible. As others have mentioned, the main cavern is self-guided and has been damaged by lack of supervision with people touching various structures. We saw ONE ranger on the entire hike and she was posted at the beginning/ending point. We went two days after Christmas which I would NOT recommend as a ""good"" time to go. It was very crowded and people can be quite inconsiderate, not only with flash photography, but loud talking, unruly children wearing miner hats they sell in the gift shop which put off an intensely bright light, stopping and standing in the middle of walkways, and being annoying in general. #2- find the least crowded time to go and go then! When there's a thousand people down in the caverns with you, it takes some of the magic away. #3- know that the walkways on the self-guided tour are damp and dimly lit. If you don't see well in the dark, I would recommend a small personal flashlight. Do NOT bring something that is large or will disturb the experience of other people. Wear comfortable shoes with good tread. #4- Others recommend the audio tours, which I would agree with. Signs are only posted sporadically throughout the self-guided tour and I have a feeling there is much more to know/experience through the use of the audio. I regret not having had them. #5- Book a tour. I've toured through several caverns across the United States and the guided tours are always better. #6- Book your tours online way far in advance. My husband and I planned our trip approximately two weeks in advance and tried to get tickets online but everything was booked. Plan ahead to get the best experience. #7- Hike the natural entrance if you're able-bodied. It's incredible. Then ride the elevator up because the ""up"" is the hard part! #8- Dress in layers. The cave is humid and cool in temperature. The day we went, it was 29 degrees outside, so it was actually warmer inside of the cave! We had dressed in layers which made it easy to remove a jacket when we generated heat from walking. The opposite applies as well; when it's warm outside and you're wearing shorts, you might feel more comfortable in the cave with a jacket and/or long pants. #9- There are parts of the self-guided tour that are completely inaccessible to wheelchairs. Everyone has to go through a large revolving door when taking the elevators. It's not impossible to get a wheelchair through, however it looks cumbersome. #10- Pathways are narrow, and although it's more weight for the parent, it's advisable to wear your baby/toddler as opposed to pushing a stroller. There are restrooms conveniently located at the entrance/exit of the self-guided tour. There is also a small snack stand for refreshments, I'd recommend bringing hand sanitizer if you're planning to eat after your tour. Elevator wait times vary; for us it was about a 20 minute wait because they only have 2 running at present, each only able to carry up or down 8 people at a time. One ranger mentioned they are close to and will open the other additional 2 elevators some time in January with each having a capacity of 16, I think. There are minimal places to sit while waiting in line for the elevators and the ground is damp and dirty, making it an inadvisable option. #11- come with an open-mind, all of the patience you can muster, a positive attitude, well-rested and fed, and you'll make the most of it!","December 29, 2017",Beautiful Big Cavern,84,"Arlington, Texas",4

The formations of Calcite, gypsum stalactite are unique and inspiring. Even the bottomless pit makes you afraid to lean too far over. There is a paved walkway with rails. Every stop is a photo opportunity. The formations let your imaginations run wild. It's 1.2 mile walk. We enjoyed every moment. This is what Carlsbad caverns are all about.

Big Room,"The highlight of Carlsbad Caverns. A must see if you are in the area or driving I-10 and have the time Obviously the caves are out of the way for normal travelers, but if you can make the time, do so. This self guided tour has the major highlights of the cave. It can be as short as 30 minutes or up to 2 hours, depending upon your route and how fast you want to walk. I would recommend the KIng's Palace Tour or Left Hand Tunnel tour afterwards, if time allows. Small children may not be so enthused by this attraction; especially after about an hour.The cost of the tour is reasonable. Lodging costs in Carlsbad is rather high currently, due to the oil drilling boom in the area. There is a restaurant in the Visitor Center, or at the bottom in the cave, in case you make a day of the Caverns.Most people will want to take the elevators down. It is faster and easier. The Natural Entrance is great, but long and steep in sections. Only take it if you have the time, like to walk a bit, and wear good shoes. I would not hike out the Natural Entrance unless you want a nice work out. Oh, and be ready for the cool temperature, especially in summer. A light jacket is a must.

Big Room,"Carlsbad Caverns is so neat and definitely not something you’ll see everyday! The visitor center is large and has 2 gift shops and a little restaurant. You can take an elevator down into the Caverns or hike down (about a mile, you drop 750ft). Once down there it is easy walking but half of the path restricts wheel chairs. Strollers are not permitted. The cave is quiet and you’ll only hear the dripping of water. We went in December so the park was very quiet and slow. We had a very peaceful visit to the Caverns, although I’m sure summer is busier. Outside it was very chilly and windy so we thought we would need to bundle up to go down but turns out the Caverns are way warmer and have quite a bit of humility so winter coats were not necessary for this time of the year. It was 56 degrees down there with 90% humidity. It costs $10 per person to go down. We spent over an hour in the cavern itself. You can ride the elevator back up to save yourself a mile long switchback (paved) hike. One regret: not having my nice camera with higher power flash. The Caverns are very dimly lit, but light enough for you to see. My iPhone did alright in some spots but I wish I had my actual camera.I left you are in the are, go to the Caverns!

They have replaced most of the lighting with LEDs which seems to make it dimmer than before, so watch your step, as there are many steep and/or wet places on the trail.

Big Room,"The day I went, there was a delay in opening the natural entrance, so I took the elevator down. I happened to be in the first group of the day, which was great. I highly recommend going early and being first if you can, because it was so much quieter with no one else in there yet. Take your time and plan on spending at least an hour going through the Big Room. My cell phone photos turned out surprisingly well with no special equipment, I just turned the flash off. I have been in other caves, but this is in a class by itself. I'm so glad I went and would recommend it to anyone.You can buy postcards down there (small selection, though) and if you ask, they will stamp them saying they were mailed from 750 feet below the surface. There is a mailbox right there that you can drop them in. You can also buy stamps. There are many more postcards and other souvenirs available in the gift shop up top.","October 13, 2017",Seriously amazing,43,"Northern Great Plains, USA",5

Big Room,"My grown son and I took the elevators down 750' and took the walking tour of the ""Big Room"". I've been in many ""Tourist"" caverns thru the US and this was far away the best. We couldn't get a ranger tour but the self guided tour with the wireless players was very nice. There isn't a lot of color in this cave but that is due to the fact that they eschew the use of colored lights that many other places use. They use white light letting the natural color and texture of the stone speak for itself. I really would NOT recommend strollers or wheelchairs if you are taking the full tour as there are a large number of rather steep slopes throughout that path.The audio tour is really quite nice although it is hard to find the proper buttons on the remote in the dark at times. Be sure and use the restrooms before starting out and be prepared for a LONG wait at the elevators to go back to the surface especially after 1pm. you have 3 different tours battling to get back up and only 2 smallish elevators to service them. It may take up to 60 minutes in line to reach the elevators for your quick ride up. Be sure and plan for that delay.","October 3, 2017",Amazing Tour,192,"Conyers, Georgia",5
Big Room,"The Big Room is a tour all by itself; albeit self guided. It takes about an hour but it is well worth the extra time to stroll through this portion of the cave; you will be glad you did. Some of the formations created by the limestone are just amazing; from the stalagmites to the stalactites, the ribbon formations, and some of the other large caves that can be seen. Simply amazing!","October 1, 2017",Amazing huge Caverns with gorgeous limestone creations,17,"Dallas, Texas",5
Big Room,There were very few people it was nice having the place practically to yourself. You cant beat the price for admission. The only thing I will say is that when they tell you the elevator doesnt work to get back up please understand that you will have to hike back out of there the same way you went in and it is a very exhausting and physical thing to do.,"September 26, 2017",Great time to go,2,,4
Big Room,"September is a great time to visit. We walked the Big Room tour practically alone HOWEVER the elevators are NOT running right now. The only way up or down is on the trail, including employees, all supplies, handicapped, everyone. Be prepared for a strenuous trek 800 up on the way back. HOW MUCH TIME YOU''LL NEED: It's about a 45 minute walk from the visitor center to the rest station in the cave where the tours meet, and that's if you hurry. Most of this is underground. The above-ground trail is maybe a quarter mile. If you want to stop and look, take some pics, and rest a bit, allow at least an hour. WHAT TO WEAR/TAKE: You'll be walking downhill, sometimes steep, on multiple switchbacks so wear good shoes. It's low 50's and damp in the cave but if you're walking you'll be warm with a light jacket. If you're on a ranger-led tour you'll spend time standing and sitting and get colder. The trip up is harder and you'll get hot. Wear layers. A small flashlight or your cell phone is handy but not necessary. Taking water is a good idea. Outside food is not allowed. Take your camera. There is a restroom HOW MUCH TIME YOU NEED: The King's Palace tour, which was incredible, and took about 1:40 minutes. The Big Room self-guided tour took about an hour to walk. The walk back uphill took us almost an hour. Altogether, the walk up and down, both tours, a quick lunch at the cave snack bar, and the walk back uphill took about 4 1/2 hours total. This included bathroom breaks and some picture taking, however we are fit so we made it up the hill at a decent rate. FOOD: Food or flavored drinks below are prohibited in the cave. Just bring water. We had a surprisingly good ham sandwich in the cave snack bar. It cost $7.50. They also have salads, yogurt, granola bars, and water. There's a larger restaurant in the visitor center above that has cafeteria style hot food and much more selection but we didn't eat there. KING'S PALACE vs BIG ROOM TOUR: You'll see the same types of formations on either tour but each offers something the other doesn't. The guided tour gave us insight into things we never would have known or even thought to ask about and we saw some rooms that you can't see any other way, including one that was used in Journey To The Center Of The Earth. The ranger was super informative, told stories, answered questions, and set a pace everyone could keep up with. The Big Room tour is self-guided and free (after you've paid the park admission). You'll go through an area as big as six football fields full of fantastic formations. There are also some interesting water features. Both are awe-inspiring. Big Room is slightly faster and you can set your own pace. I'm happy we did both but 4-5 hours underground could be a bit much for some people. Definitely schedule time for a break and some food in between if you do both. STORES & SOUVENIRS: There is a nice big store with a lot of goods in the visitor center above and a small one in the cave. Buy your things above unless you need them so you don't have to carry everything back. BATS: We didn't see the bats, sadly. The area to watch them is just before the cave entrance, about 1/4 mile walk from the visitor center with amphitheater-style seating. Check sunset time during your visit. Although you won't see bats in the part of the cave you walk through you will smell them but as you descend the odor goes away. ","September 24, 2017",Without an elevator!,183,"Venice, Florida",5

We entered caves via elevators and inside was quite chilly so we bought a hoody before starting with exploration. The cave is incredible especially Big Room. There is a feeling of enormous space, stalactites and stalagmites are of epic proportion. Thewalk was gentle - covers a roughly x-shaped gallery with beautifully lit features.Highly recommended .... and the tip is to go midweek.

Big Room,"I am very claustrophobic and was unsure about going 750 feet underground into a cave. As soon as I saw it all my fears disappeared. the room is huge!!. There is a cement path on a 1.5 mile loop nicely lit to best view the formations. We did not purchase the audio tour, but there are signs explaining most of the formations. We spent several hours in the cave walking the trail and taking breaks every so often. There are rangers on duty on the trail every so often to answer questions and help with directions if you get turned around. I just wish we could have seen the bats. Word of caution, if you have been in another cave in the past 6 months and have any of the same equipment, cell phone camera, shoes, clothing on you will be asked to decontaminate it to stop the spread of white nose syndrome in bats. We had been to Mammoth Cave 4 weeks before and had to clean our shoes with disinfectant wipes before they let us on the elevator.","September 17, 2017",Beautiful is all I can say,79,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

I rarely walk around in awe, but I did today for hours. - We did the paid King's Palace tour before touring the Big Room. Definitely worth the pittance they ask for as an admission price and really helped our understanding of what we saw in the Big Room. - The kids were glad they had a light jacket with them.- We got there early, around 9am on a weekday, and there were no lines.- I went back to the car and got a flashlight before touring the Big Room and am really glad I did. It helped a lot to see details in the areas that aren't lit up - the stronger the beam the better. It would have been nice to have on the King's Palace portion.

Big Room,"All my my 10 ten year old daughter could say was ""this is astounding!"" It was definitely an amazing experience. The big room is HUGE and takes about an hour to do the self-guided tour. There are lots of formations and there are displays along the way that tell about the formations and other items of interest. We didn't get the audio tour, but according to a few others along the way it was worth it. I don't recommend visiting on a Saturday during peak tourist season. We did and there were SO many people! We had to wait in line about 20 minutes to get tickets down to the cave. The elevator ride down took just a short time - we waited in line for maybe 3 minutes and then another 2-3 minutes for the elevator to return from the previous group. There were only 4 of us riding down at the time, so not too bad. However, the line to ride back up the elevator had a wait of at least one and a half hours, so we hiked out the natural entrance, which was a brutal one-mile climb ascending 800 feet to the surface. The crowds in the cave were quite unpleasant. People had brought very small children down, some of whom were screaming (for about 2 hours relentlessly). If you have small children prone to screaming for hours on end, maybe a cave tour with hundreds of other people is NOT the best vacation choice. In general, I don't like crowds or rude people - so while I LOVED the cave, I would have enjoyed it more on a day that was less busy.","July 30, 2017",Astounding!,29,"De Queen, Arkansas",5
Big Room,"My husband and I have been to Carlsbad Caverns a couple times over the past 33 years. The Big Room is always fascinating. The temperature was 57 degrees but we did not need a jacket. I guess the humidity made the cave feel warmer. In the past, we took the elevator down then back up but this time we took the natural entrance. The natural entrance to the Big Room was 1.25 miles and took us almost an hour. We loved the natural entrance and the Big Room.","July 26, 2017",Fantastic,631,"Austin, Texas",5
Big Room,"Natural Entrance and Big Room - A wonderful stroll down into the depths of the cave. Yes it is a long walk, but all down hill and it gets you in the mood by passing more and more impressive formations. By the time you get to the Big Room believe me, you are ready to walk on flat ground and take in the truly spectacular. Again the walk around the Big Room is also a long trail, so take your time. For some it may appear somewhat repetitive, so if you or some of you party have short attention spans it may be too long an ordeal. You can always take the elevators, but expect a lengthy wait there too, as they are relatively small lifts so it takes some time. The wife and I, 61 and 56 respectively walked down, around and back up (much to her protest). But it was doable and felt a good sense of accomplishment (come on, they did this back in the 20's in their sunday best over wooden scaffolding - you can do it). But understand there is a bit of walking too between the parking lot and the entrance, so be prepared for a lot of walking - take water. Don't worry about getting cold, you are exercising enough to stay comfortable. Not in any hurry we took our time and I estimate it was a good 3 1/2 hours all told. Add another 40 minutes at the visitor center if you take in the short movie and exhibits. Wish the movie went more into the early days of discovery and tourism history, to me that's as fascinating as the nature story. So have a big breakfast or lunch before arriving, spend a good chunk of the day exploring and reward yourself back in town with a big meal and a drink for a successful close to a unique experience. We visited the caverns in 3 phases, it began with the early evening bat program the first day, visitors center, the Natural Entrance and Big Room on the 2nd day and the following morning we did the Lower Cave tour. It was a great progression that enhanced the overall experience. An easy set up, solid middle and a grand finale. Go for it.","July 25, 2017",100M years in the making,77,"Chantilly, Virginia",5

Really something to see. We decided on the elevator route down since it was getting late. 4:00pm and they told us we had to move fast if we wanted to go through the natural entrance. Once down we finished the whole path system in about an hour or so. Then came the challenge. They told us it was 45 minutes to walk out and we had to go now because it was closing at 5:30. So we opted for the elevator with the other 100 people. It took over 30 minutes in line to get up through the elevator ( it's a 750ft ride and takes 57 seconds).

Big Room,"We recently traveled back home to Tucson from Illinois. We decided to make a road trip out of this 1800 mile trek and to stop at some never- before visited locations. So after reading up about this national park, we journeyed early across the New Mexican Chihuahuan Desert to beat the other travelers and to get a spot at the kennel to board our dogs while we toured the cave. While getting our general admission tickets (free due to Senior Pass), I asked if there were any cancellations for the ranger-guided tour of the King's Palace. We lucked out and secured two tickets for the 9:00 a.m. tour. An elevator took us down approximately 9 stories to an underground wonderland. Ranger Lindsey led us through another story down a well-paved path with handrails. I had had some trepidation about our ability to endure the tour as my husband is not too steady on his feet. But these two seniors made it just fine. The cave chambers are beautifully lit enabling visitors to appreciate the magnificent formations of stalactites and stalagmites and columns. An outstanding feature was the green lake. There were stops with low walls to sit on and reflect upon the beauty while the ranger explained the history and exploration of the cave. One would never suspect from above ground the beauty that lies below.

Big Room,"I need to start by saying that Carlsbad Caverns is my second-favorite place in the United States behind Yellowstone. The whole cavern blew me away with it's assortment of passages, rooms, and especially formations. Just incredible. I've been to Mammoth Caves, Wind Cave, Jewel Cave, and numerous State Park caves. There is no equal to Carlsbad Caverns. The Big Room is the highlight. It's like visiting a museum of cave jewels. It's just so big and diverse that nothing on Earth compares. If I could rate it more than 5 TripAdvisor circles, I would. Now that I talked you into going, here's some advice:- Carlsbad Caverns is remote. The nearest major airport is El Paso, 2+ hours away (and expensive). Dallas and San Antonio are 8 hours away. You need a plan. Fortunately, Carlsbad is a decent city with plenty of accommodations, restaurants, and a Wal-Mart. Combine a trip to Carlsbad with White Sands, Guadalupe Mountain, Big Bend, or other attractions. There is plenty to do!- This area gets really hot in the summer. Really, Really hot. Go in a reliable vehicle with A/C.- Go Early. Very Early. Avoid crowds. Avoid Heat. Get underground before others and plan to spend 4+ hours down there. - Walking is permitted on designated trails only. All trails are paved, but can get very steep and a little slick.- It's cool down there. You may need a jacket.- Walk up if you can. If not, walk down. If you can'd do either, take the elevator. You will see the greatest highlights in the Big Room regardless.- In advance, schedule an add on tour of the King's Palace or Left Hand Tunnel, or Lower Cave. These sell out early. We did the King's Palace because it was all that was available. The other tours are probably incredible with smaller groups, but if all you see is the Big Room, you will be blown away. - There is a small restaurant at the bottom with reasonable prices. You will stay longer that you think and you will get hungry! Take a lunch with you if possible.- There are restrooms and a gift shop inside the Big Room too.- Don't miss the Bat Flight program during summer evenings. - Split your visit into a couple of days if you can.

There isn't much to see coming or going. The Sonoran Desert is beautiful and interesting in its way, but a bit monotonous after many hours in the car. It was also extremely hot. But the caves remain a constant temperature all the time, which was a nice respite. We all wore short sleeves and were comfortable but come from a place that's quite cold in the winter so if you are not so acclimated, a light jacket is probably a good idea. It's also very damp and you'll likely get dripped on a a number of times. Didn't bother us. We took the steep winding path in and were quite glad we did as it familiarized us with types of formations and accustomed us to the dark, hushed atmosphere. We did purchase the audio tour but found that since we took a guided tour of the King's Palace we didn't need it. I would recommend budgeting an hour to get down to the ""Lunchroom"", a large open space with a small snack bar and restrooms where the King's Palace tour meets and then at least another hour to go through the Big Room.

There was a very noticeable difference in the crowds...none in the morning and it began to get crowded as we were leaving!Why do crowds matter? As other reviews have noted, if you want to go down to the Big Room on the elevator, the lines for the elevator can get really long (and they only allow 8 people per elevator ride up/down). Also, just navigating through the Big Room is kind of like in a single file line; we didn't feel rushed because it wasn't very crowded.Our family took the elevators down vs. the Natural Entrance.

Trying to go back up around 11:40 am...we had a short wait of about 5-6 minutes...no complaints, but I imagine when the crowds swell, the wait time is probably astronomical.Elevators--I recommend the elevators to anyone with an ankle/foot/leg disability/injury. I tore two ligaments, had tendinitis in two spots and plantar fasciitis last May. I was off work 4.5 months and did 3 months of physical therapy. I said all of that to say...I considered the Natural Entrance but was ultimately glad I made the decision to take the elevator in and out of the Big Room. Even with my ankle brace on, and a slow pace, I still found a minimal amount of difficulty and moderate amount of pain taking this path. Some, not many, places have steep spots on the path. It was a nice visit, but I did hurt afterwards.The cave itself was nice! Great and fun to be in the largest known cave in the world. We did the audio tour for $5 per wand. We just rented two, because I knew my 17 year old would not care, lol. I'm glad we rented the audio tours because there was really great and informative information given! Be sure to rent at least one, otherwise you are left to guess what you are viewing.My kids enjoyed it, but the youngest two probably could have done the shortcut that's offered during the tour. Overall, it was a great addition to our roadtrip. Afterwards, the kids all jumped in the pool and it made for a fun day!","June 5, 2017","Family vacation with 17, 11, and 9 year olds",4,"Houston, Texas",4

We so enjoyed the Kings Palace we decided to extend our tour to include the Big Room. The entrance fee covers the Big Room. Photography is allowed. The Big Room is the size of three football fields & can hold two Capitol Domes. It is a natural wonder! Allow an hour to take it all in. If you wish, you can take the elevator down & up. We chose to walk in via the Natural Entrance and take the elevator when we departed. It made sense to do it that way, since the Natural Entrance is mostly downhill when entering. Only water is allowed in the Caverns but food and water are available for purchase in the Cavern's cafe as well as restrooms.","May 28, 2017",An amazing experience!,208,"West Linn, Oregon",5

It is even wheelchair accessible for most of the loop. It provides you with some of the most iconic views. Personally, I recommend making the time to spend 4 hours hiking down from the natural entrance but if you are time restricted, elderly, have more young kids than you can carry in a kid carrier or have any other access related issues, this is the way to go.","May 12, 2017","If you don't have time for both loops, do this one",17,,5

Big Room,"The caves were the main attraction for a recent trip to New Mexico. My husband and I wanted the full cave experience so we dedicated two days to the caverns. Unbeknownst to me, the entrance fee with receipt is good for 3 consecutive days - bonus. The entire trip was planned with assistance a previous Tripadvisor review. It was muy helpful. Since I cannot post the link: Google: ""how many days to spend in carlsbad caverns"" >the first link that pops up ""how much time do we need? > scroll down to the review by KthSch and click the first link in his review (<was a seriously helpful review). Two to three weeks prior to our trip I booked ranger guided tours online (this was in April). I would recommend this as I overhead people visiting the caverns stating that all tours were sold out. However you do not need to have a ranger guided tour to enjoy the caves. The first day my husband and I took the natural entrance route. At a steady/rushed pace, with infrequent stops it took us may be 45 minutes to get to the bottom. We toured the King's Palace in the morning which is great for seeing structures and curtains up close. This was a pretty easy stroll and husband agrees, there was a gentleman with a cane on this tour with us. The afternoon we took a leisure stroll through the Big Room. Admittedly we shared an audio tour with the volume on high. Again, this was an easy stroll with wheelchair access in some places. The next day we had a Lower Cave tour that lasted approx 4-hours. This was the most strenuous trek requiring some easy rope repelling and climbing steep, but sturdy metal ladders into the lower cave. It was totally work it, the Lower Cave is mesmerizing. We booked the Left Hand tour in the afternoon, this did not allow us to stop for lunch. This tour is done in candle light. I'd say this is less for seeing structures and more for the cave experience. Some pretty amazing fossils to be viewed in this tour. Parking was a breeze at this time of the year. The cafeteria has reasonable food. Good walking shoes are a must. As far as clothing: I run cold and was okay in pants, a t-shirt and light jacket. My husband runs hot and he was in pants and t-shirt both days. Rangers are cool and helpful.

Of all the caves that we have visited - Postojna and Skocjan Caves in Slovenia, Mammoth Cave in Kentucky - it is the cheapest ($10) and is not crowded or touristy.The Big Room opens at 8:30am. You can enter through the Natural Entrance or take the elevator down, and most of walkway inside the Big Room is accessible, which is excellent planning by the NPS. We went through the Natural Entrance and were in the Big Room by 9:30am. There were very few people, and we enjoyed doing the 1 mi/1.6 km walk, which took us about 1 hour. It felt very peaceful and tranquil. Although the rock formations are not very different from what we've seen already, we really appreciated visiting the exhibits in the Big Room at our own pace.

The elevator opens right at the snack bar area just before the entrance to the ""Big Room"". The paths have no steps, are mostly even and dry, and do not require stooping over like in some caverns. Wear shoes that grip the surface, like boat shoes, or rubber soled athletic shoes. You may take your cane or walking poles to help with stability. If you have difficulty seeing in dim light, a small flashlight to illuminate the path just before your feet helps a lot. I used one to illuminate the path for my husband. The path is wide enough for 2 people across, so you may walk as far as you like in the Big Room, and then turn around and return to the elevator against the traffic of people going into the Big Room. If you opt for this, you can see the Big Room and take photos in about an hour's time in order not to tire yourself.","April 18, 2017","Accessible, but not wheelchair accessible, via the elevator in the visitor's center",596,"Austin, Texas",5

We were there a couple of hours, just took a self-tour and I could not believe how many pictures I ended up taking. Every few steps, the scene changes as you just walk around absorbing this fantastic, amazing place. You need to use a flash on your camera to really get the best photos. But when you see these pictures, you will be amazed at the completely natural beauty that you experienced walking around over 700 feet underground. Another thing I liked, was that it was not that cold there as some other caves I've visited have been.

Big Room,"When one hears Carlsbad Caverns one either thinks of the Bat Flight or large chambers filled with massive formations; the Big Room self-guided tour epitomizes the later and is the one tour all visitors should absolutely take.The nearly flat, partially accessible, trail is just over 1 mile (1.6k) long can be reached via the Natural Entrance Tour or the elevators from the visitor center down to the rest area/lunchroom where the tour begins. The Park Service estimates 1.5 hours to complete the tour but it really depends on how many times one stops to oh-and-ah.The trail loops one around the outside of the huge 8.2 acre (33.2k sq m) chamber, the largest single chamber in North America, full of amazing cave formations including many of the most famous features of Carlsbad Caverns including Giant Dome, Twin Domes, Lion’s Tail, Bottomless Pit, Rock of Ages and the Painted Grotto.If one is short on time or stamina, there is a shortcut at Caveman Junction that shortens the trail to just over 0.5 mile (0.8k) without missing a lot. The back part of the cavern that is skipped is drier, therefore less decorated, and the only major features bypassed are View of the Lower Cave, Top of the Cross and the Bottomless Pit.A couple of things about visiting the cave in general; you may wish to wear a light jacket as the temperature is 56F (13C) year-round and one should wear shoes with a rubber sole for maximum traction. Plain drinking water is permitted but no other drink, food or gum is permitted. While the trails are well lit, you may wish to bring a flash light. Cameras and flash photography are allowed and tripods and monopods are permitted on the self-guided Natural Entrance and Big Room Tours but not the ranger-guided King’s Palace Tour.

Big Room,"it is the Big Room and the path down to it that makes this park truly special. We have been there before and loved it each time. I'll attach a few pics as well but find it difficult to describe this adequately. Special consideration needs to be given to the rigor required to enjoy this park. When we were there the elevator was out of service, which accounts for the decision my wife made to let me do the walk and have the responsibility to capture pics for her. The rangers are cautious to keep this message up front for all visitors. My visit took more than 4 and a half hours. I took my time for sure as I was taking quite a few photos. A younger person would certainly be able to accomplish the walk more quickly if needed. As I noted, I have been there before and truly enjoyed it. This time though I noted that the Park Service in in the process of converting the lighting from regular incandescent to led lighting. This will surely reduce the energy cost but it will also had the additional impact of causing the need to be more conscious of the color of the light being implemented.

It is wonderful to be able to take one's own time on the trail. It all guide-lead tours, we feel rushed. Here we spent 4 hr on this supposed 1.5hr walk, and enjoyed every minute. This tour matches any we've had at any other cave, including MO's Onondaga, and AK's Blanchard Springs (two of the best other caves we've been to). One last tip: your ticket is good for 3 days, so keep it around in case you come back.","January 1, 2017","beautiful cave, nice tour",25,Wisconsin,5

Also, there are restrooms close by, which is a good thing if you took your time hiking in. You can stop for a bite to eat and something to drink in the dining room as well.

Big Room,"The Big Room tour is the main attraction to Carlsbad Caverns. The info stands offer a lot of information about the formation of the caves and of the different type of features (stalagmites, ribbons, straws, etc.). There are a lot of features where you can spend time deciding just what they look like. This is the tour for kids, since there are a lot of ways to shorten the tour if they get cranky.Give yourself plenty of time to see the entire cave, a minimum of two hours to really enjoy it. Watch the time because they do close the caves earlier than you might think, based on the park's hours. You really want to have the time to do it right, and not rush through it.Photography. This is best done with a SLR camera with good zoom and wide angle, a decent flash, and a good f-range; many of the features are lighted, but they are a distance off and the lighting isn't that strong. Point-and-shoot cameras will work, but their flashes won't capture a lot of the caves because of their limited useable distance, so expect to not capture some of the features. In fact, I would suggest, for the distance shots, turning off the flash entirely. You will capture the feature, but the colors of the stone may be lost.","December 20, 2016",This is the main attraction,67,"Southwest, Pennsylvania",5
Big Room,"The Carlsbad Caverns National Park in the Guadalupe Mountain range is extensive and fun to visit. We decided to do the Big Room tour ourselves due to time constraints and at the recommendation of the ranger. Highly recommend you watch the video before going down, if this is your first visit.It was 13:00 hours and down we went in the elevator 900 ft. Once the door opened we were greeted by one of the cavern chambers. First impression was not favorable, but once we started our adventure around the winding diverse and beautiful caverns, stopping, taking pictures and absorbing their massive formation and development, we were fascinated. The elevator took us back st 16:00 hours.Afterwards, we took the side roads around the park to see animals and the mountain range, we were not disappointed.","December 13, 2016",Outstanding experience ,66,,5

People with their flash cameras ruin the experience a little bit. Hope their photos turned out ... If you need to, you can take the elevator down, but you will miss a lot.

Big Room,"Over 40 years ago, while touring with a band, I visited these incredible caverns. Over the years, I tried to get my wife here, but from our home in So Cal, it was just too far off our planned route any time we were in the general area. Not to mention, accommodations in the area are lacking. (We found a great motel - thanks, TA - on the other side of Carlsbad. But we are RV'ers. RV parks are not up to our standards in the area.) We rode the elevator down pretty close to the last allowable time to visit the 'Big Room'. My 1960's 'California Girl' is now in her '60's and having hip issues. Walking the entire, very well engineered trail, was too much for her. There is a shorter route that we should have taken. Honestly, the cavern is so impressively overwhelming, I think the shorter route would be the best option for most visitors. At one point, though she was hurting a bit, my wife said to me, ""I can see why you've talked about this all these years. This is incredible.""","October 27, 2016",When I was young . . .,166,"Murrieta, California",5

We were there about 10AM, and my husband and I were the only ones in the elevator which was great since I'm a little claustrophobic and the elevators are on the small side. The Great Room seems to go on for ever. The lighting is quite good for pictures - I was surprised at how good our pictures turned out considering the overwhelming depth of space with relatively little light. An earlier poster pointed out to try and enjoy the moment and not continually take pictures and that's great advice - probably a little hard to follow though as just about every thing you see is amazing!We had lunch at the cafeteria adjacent to the gift shop. Food was ok and gift shop was nice.","October 23, 2016",Incredible experience,99,Upstate NY,5

We used the modern restrooms at the rest area then went on to see the Big Room. Oh, my! It is beyond words in beauty. If you are limited in ability to walk, take the elevator down. Everyone has to exit via the elevator. I am a bit claustophobic and had no problem with this hike.","October 22, 2016",So AWESOME,13,,5

Big Room,We did the self guided tour and did rent the audio guide. We walk down and rode the elevator up. Make sure you call ahead to see if the book store is open. If they aren't you won't be able to rent the audio tour. It's worth the $5.00. This is one of the few parks that I've been to that has limited hours. So don't think you are going to show up and take a paid tour. If you are short on time call ahead and book ahead. I loved walking down and doing it without a big group. The guide enabled us to enjoy the cave at our own pace. We were down there for 3.5 hours. They close early because they have to get everyone out before the bats start flying out of the cave.

Big Room,"I don't know how I missed this but perhaps because some tours are guided, and the Big Room is not, I thought the highlight would be the Guided Tours. Not so. Due to our limited time, we skipped the walk in. You take the elevator down and on your left as you emerge is the entrance tunnel to the Big Room. On your right is the snack area. Further to your right is a set of restrooms. Because we had a 10:30 tour, we went to see the Big Room, arriving at about 9:00 am. Moving quickly, you can do this in about an hour. If you get there early in the morning in early October, almost no one is there. It simply defies description. ""Breathtaking"" comes to mind, but doesn't quite capture it. ""Endless variation,"" might be more like it. I have been to caverns in Oregon and Pennsylvania and more inhabited caves in Europe at Gibraltar and in the southern Netherlands. In the ""Big Room,"" it felt as though you were done, and then you would turn a corner, and there would be more. You had this sense that without a path, you would wander endlessly and never come out. The lighting is surprisingly good and warm, which gives the place a stage lit glow. The path is paved and wheelchair-accessible for portions. In general, we were happy to be on a paved path because we were so distracted by the sights that we wouldn't have wanted to be looking down for footing.In short, from what we saw, you are coming to see the Big Room, and maybe the steep walk in, which we didn't see. Buy tickets in advance for other tours of the cave. Get there early to avoid the crowds... when we came back up from the cavern at 12:30 there was a long line for the elevator, but because we were with a tour, we were able to go up ahead of the line. By 12:30 on a Saturday in early October, lines were not long in the cafeteria, but the Entrance Ticket lines stretched across the entire lobby.","October 10, 2016",This is the Cave You Have Been Waiting For,23,"San Juan Capistrano, California",5

Some very memorable formations for me were the Hall of the Giants and the Doll House. Give yourself plenty of time to walk the room as the trail is more than one mile, and if you're like me, you will want to stop everywhere. Wear shoes with good tread.

Once inside, you can pay your entrance fee and wait in line for the elevator that takes you down to the bottom of the big room. It's about a 750' ride down, so the ride takes approximately 1 minute, and the elevator carries only 8 people at once. Keep this in mind if you plan to visit on a weekend during peak season. (Consider coming very early to avoid long wait times.) Once you get down to the Big Room, you can do a self-guided tour and check things out! (The park offers some guided tours, but I saw a sign encouraging you to make an online reservation prior to arrival for your own convenience and for availability.) If you're something of a cave enthusiast like I am, you'll be amazed at the size of Carlsbad--I'd never been to a cave of this magnitude. It was AMAZING. The trail through the Big Room itself is a mile long if that's any indication of how large it is. Now, it is dark in the cave, but there is some low lighting, so you'll be able to see everything and photograph formations with ease. When exploring Carlsbad, you'll have a few different options. If you like, you can make your way to the natural entrance as an exit, but be advised that the route isn't handicap accessible. I happened to have injured my ankle prior to my visit, and the park staff advised me that as such, it was in my best interest to see the Big Room and return to the elevators to exit. No walking sticks are allowed in the Cavern, and some parts of the Big Room aren't handicap accessible. Not to worry, though, as the park provides maps to help those who might be handicapped with limited mobility get around and make the most of their visit. Also, there is a restaurant on-site at Carlsbad and there is a snack bar in the Big Room, but food and flavored drinks are only allowed in designated areas. (Plain water is allowed throughout the cavern.) Also, there are restrooms just outside the ticketing area and in the vicinity of the elevators, but be sure to take care of your personal needs before you start your tour, as it can take approximately an hour to see everything and there are no restrooms located along the cavern trail. If you plan to exit by riding the elevators back to the top, just know that you may end up waiting as long as an hour or more for your turn to ride back to the top. Also, while you're in the cave, expect temperatures to be in the 50s, so be sure to bring a sweatshirt if you're concerned about your comfort. If you forget to bring one, you can always buy a souvenir sweatshirt in the snack bar area down in the cavern. Carlsbad Caverns does have some water in it like most caves, but it's relatively dry compared to other caves I've been to, so you won't need to worry about getting too wet while you're inside. This National Park DOES participate in the Passport program, so don't forget to get your cancellation before you go. Also, this park does honor any annual passes you might have, so be sure to bring your passes, too. Of course, there is a gift shop on-site, so consider bringing a little extra cash if you want to take something special home with you. So who should visit Carlsbad? Nature enthusiasts, geology enthusiasts, families, friends, solo travelers--anyone, really! I wouldn't necessarily recommend bringing infants, but I saw a few toddlers who seemed to be doing just fine making their way through the Big Room. Overall, this is a great experience for anyone who wants to check out an impressive cave and learn a little more about caves as unique habitats.","August 2, 2016",Seven-hundred-fifty feet below!,242,"Woodbridge, Virginia",5

But back to caves and grottos, I have been to them all over the US, Europe and Central/South America plus lava tubes. This is an absolute must see and is incredible-best I have ever seen and I so wish my University age son had been with me. It is breathtaking in its beauty and is the perfect place to take children. Plus the bonus was that the elevator is currently working. I was however disappointed at all the visitors not following the rules; talking loud thus disturbing the dwindling bat colony, flashing lights on the ceiling looking for bats ( bad form ) and touching formations when they could. The Rangers were not preventing this and that was very sad. I've been to Monmouth in Kentucky as well and have seen many a Ranger there take people to task for bad behavior. They need to do this here as well...Bottom line, absolutely fabulous cave and a must see. ","July 27, 2016","Absolute Must See, Wish My College Aged Son Had Been With Me",68,"Sugar Land, Texas",5

There is plenty of seating on rock in the amphitheater and the top row is reserved for and is wheelchair accessible. Restrooms are behind the amphitheater. Remember to stick to any and all park rules. No smoking! And no electronics (smart phones, etc.) are allowed during the bat flight. And be forewarned, the posted signs can be misleading, as even when the bats have flown and most of the spectators have left and are leaving, some Park Rangers still consider the bat flight as ongoing. Some can be a bit rude in their zealous observance of the no electronic photography rule. But overall the park officials are kind and courteous to all. Also, during the bat flight the quieter the better. The bats are sensitive to loud sounds and sudden movements. If everyone cooperates in observing the rules and is reasonably quite, no one will go away disappointed. ","July 27, 2016",Bat Flight,1,,5

Big Room,"The Big Room at the Carlsbad Caverns is amazing. Perhaps it doesn't have as many features or spectacular speleothems as some wetter, more active caves, but makes up for it in the sheer size of the cavern - some 600,000 square feet. One can either walk down the long pathway into the cavern or take the elevator 750 feet down. Once in the cavern there are miles of well paved paths that wander around the site. It is well organised and maintained. It even has a restaurant and toilets in the main cavern. It was a very hot day outside when I toured, and it was very pleasant being able to take a walk in this cool underground wonderland.","July 26, 2016",A huge Cavern,76,"Ballan, Australia",5

Big Room,"You pay to enter Carlsbad caverns at the visitor center. From the visitor center, you can either go back outside and go down some ramps to the natural entrance, or you can wait inside for the next elevator to take you down. We went with the elevator. The elevator ride took about a minute, and I have to admit, a bit of panic began to come over me when I was thinking about the fact that I was descending into the earth. Exiting the elevator, your eyes have to adjust a bit. It's a bit dark. And its cold. Remember to bring a light jacket or sweater. We were told no matter the temperature outside, the caves stay the same temperature. With your paid admission, you get to do the self guided tour of the big room. You can pay for additional tours when paying for your admission (or ahead of time online) if you want to see additional parts of the caves. The big room itself is worth the price of the ticket. Its over a mile long loop and you walk through amazing rock formations that are hard to believe are made by nature and it unfathomable to imagine how long they took to form. A lot of people taking pictures, but the pictures don't capture the enormity of these formations or even the size of the room itself. I think you could spend all day walking through and inspecting all there is to see. The whole path is not wheelchair or walker accessible. There is a point where people using either assistance have to take a short cut path as the rest of the path is at a steep slope.","July 21, 2016",pictures don't do it justice,27,"Redwood City, California",5

The Big Room is encircled by a well- defined walking path that allows one to marvel at all the sights. From the ceiling in the center of the room hangs a magnificent Chandelier, formed of stalactites. Some of the Caverns most significant formations can be viewed as you progress around the room. Some of my favorites were the patterned pools and small chamber-like vignettes on the outside of the paths. But, there is no denying the magnificence of the Hall of Giants or Rock of Ages.

I've never done any of those, so can't comment. We did the entire walk through the big room, and it's not as long as you might expect. Definitely worth taking a leisurely stroll.

I've never visited caverns before and wasn't quite sure what to expect, so traversing the switchbacks of the cave entrance passing exhausted hikers coming out, I had no idea what we were about to see. Once inside, you pass the bat portion of the cave. We visited too early in the year, so no bats were present, but worry not, you can still catch their smell as you pass by. The actual descent seems to be easy enough, though I can imagine if one has bad/weak knees, this might be a challenge. For most, if not all, of the trek down into the cave there are side rails to hang on to. It's pretty amazing because all the while walking through here is difficult to watch where you're going because you're so busy looking up and around you. I had serious rubbernecking trauma, but it was so worth it. It does get a bit cooler in the depths of the cave and there is no cell service. There are elevators available, but COME ON. The best part is the experience. However, for those that need it, they are available. Though they were not in service when we went. Fine by me! There is also a restroom and restaurant at the bottom too, which is nice.Don't touch the formations! Leave them in their natural state and take pictures instead.

It's roughly 75 floors to the bottom of the elevator, so many people are unwilling to hike the trail up and back out. The elevators just reopened a few days ago. We took the elevator down, and beat much of the crowd to the bottom. We spent about four hours exploring before hiking up the path out.

The Big Room was strategically lit and had something different to look at on each turn. This really is a natural wonder.

Big Room,"The Big Room is just what it sounds like- the biggest 'room' in the Carlsbad Cave system. This is the best room, in my opinion. It had the most interesting formations, as well as the entrance (natural hole in the ceiling) to the 'Spirit World' in the middle to back portion. The rope from the two explorers who climbed up into the hole to firther explore the cave sustem still hangs there. The 800ft descent into the cave from ground level is a bit tedious, and the ascent out is somewhat of a challenge. I like to think I'm in fairly good shape, but I have to admit, I did break a sweat and got out of breath coming back up the extensive ramps. The elevator is out of order until sometime in May or afterwards according to park rangers. It's totally worth all the hard work to get in and out.

Big Room,Nature at its best. Must admit that I enjoyed Katchner Caverns more as everyone got a guided tour and the rangers were able to describe what you were seeing.

The walk down is special too though, so it's not too out of the way. The sheer size of the big room and the formations it houses, was simply amazing. It feels like an alien world down there. There's enough light in the caverns to see where you're going, but you are allowed to bring a flashlight to see more detail. We used our flashlight app on the phone for those instances. Bring a small backpack with some water, or you'll end up paying extra for the drinks at the bottom. Pictures taken without the flash worked best. We took all ours with camera phones, but a better camera with longer exposure features would be best.Highly recommend this park.","January 21, 2016",Amazing cave system and formations,11,"Tampa, Florida",5

My pictures weren't as great as I would have liked, but I didn't find a really good setting on my camera for capturing them. Play with your camera settings before you go. The immense size and scope of this Big Room is awesome. Some of the areas had signs explaining what they are known as. Others only had number signs that went with the optional audio tour. We were there on a January weekday, and enjoyed the lack of crowds. Great time to visit. A light sweatshirt was too much for me, and I soon had it off. You are walking so much that you don't need a heavy coat. We did the entire Big Room, but there is a cutoff is you want to shorten your tour. The trail is a one way path.

Big Room,"We visited the Big Room in the afternoon after taking the Kings Palace Tour. This is a one-mile self-guided walk around the perimeter of the largest room in the cave. You can get the audio guide if you like but we opted not to. It takes about 1.5 hours to walk the entire circular route and you get to see a lot of famous features like Painted Grotto, and Rock of Ages to name a couple. If there is only one thing you see at Carlsbad Caverns this would be it. The walk is relatively flat and well lit. Strollers aren't allowed by wheelchairs can access about 2/3 of the walk with assistance. There is an online guide that gives more information about accessibility.You can access the Big Room from elevators that are located in the Visitor's Center. There is also a restroom by the elevator. Check the operating hours as they change during the year.Note: We did this self-guided tour and then did the Natural Entrance Self-Guided Tour by starting by the Big Room and walking up.

Totally suggest you get the audio guide . . . but if you don't there really is adequate signage along the way as well.DO take along bottled water - the circulation in the cave will have you wanting to drink. ONLY water is allowed into the cave. DO take your camera - take a million pictures. You can always delete them. BE PREPARED to oooooh and ahhhh at various formations around each bend.

Be sure to call ahead for status. As a senior, I work out several times a week, almost sprinted for a mile and a half through to me what was mostly a long dark poorly lit cave, starting at 1:30 pm, was turned around at the elevator bathroom at 2:30 before I could get close to the Big Room, unless that was it! The lighting is under maintenance and looked like most of the cave lighting on the way down (and up!!) was off. I got more out of YouTube videos on the Internet. The Visitor Center should at least have offered a video or good books showing pics of what we would miss, and a recommendation we not take such a long hike for naught. They did recommend we come back the next day at 8:30. Bottom line, don't go in the afternoon unless you just want some great exercise, and be sure to light your own path.","November 19, 2015","After mandatory hike, never got to see it",43,"Inyokern, California",2

Elevator was not working and you have to use your own power to get down then back up. I love that! The bookstore was great and the gift shop kinda tacky. The bookstore did overcharge me for my postcards but there was no tax on day of my visit, so it kind of evened out. It is so worth the visit, the kids will love it!

Big Room,"Once there, plenty of parking. Be aware that you should wear good walking shoes since the walkway can be slippery in spots. You’ll probably want a sweater and pants but that should be sufficient. Temp in the cave was mid-fifties. If you’re there at sunset, you can watch the bats leave the “bat cave” from the trail leading down to the caves. Elevators are also an option to go down. Once in the “Big room”, it’s a 1.5 mile loop (paved path with handrails) but there’s a shortcut about half way through if you want to forgo the far end of the cave (no bats in the big room). Wheelchair access is available but not for the full loop. If you plan to take lots of photos, allow a good 2.5 hrs in the cave. The views and rock formations are amazing around every corner. Some are well lit, others not so much but be aware that it’s mostly dark in the cave (darker at the far end). Your eyes adjust fine and you will see well mostly everything but a tripod is recommended for good pictures (flash doesn’t take as good a picture as longer exposure). The cave varies in size around the loop and is quite huge in spots (high and wide and covers 600,000 square feet). It’s too bad for the low lighting because it’s very difficult to get a good wide angle shot that would show the size of the cave. At the gift shop outside the cave, there is a cool tunnel leading to the restrooms. Be sure to use it BEFORE you go in the cave. We witnessed a couple rushing back to the restrooms with a 2-3 yr old child sitting on one of the parents’ shoulders and a wide brown stain running down that parent’s back!!!","October 27, 2015",Amazing,218,"Moncton, Canada",5

The Big Room has a well maintained path approximately 1.25 miles long which is mostly accessible by wheelchair. The cavern is absolutely beautiful and a must see for anyone traveling through the area. The temperature is cool, approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit, so if you are sensitive to cold, bring a sweatshirt. Plan on spending about 2 hours in the Big Room if you don't want to rush.

We'll be back when their older and do some of the guided tours. We also used the dog kennel service (first come first serve) for our large dog. The kennels are a bit small if your dog is big (ours is 80 lbs). But she was fine and it allowed us to stop and enjoy this beautiful site even though no dogs are allowed in the caverns.","August 14, 2015","Absolutely Amazing, Dog Kennels available ",12,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5

At first we were going to hike the Natural Entrance, but we got there later in the day than planned and ended up taking the elevator up and down. I'm really glad we did, because my girls started getting tired about 3/4 of the way around the Big Room walk (the baby was in a baby backpack the whole time, no strollers allowed). That said, we all thought it was amazing. The signs were helpful and the trail was paved and easy to walk. Looking at the different stalactites and stalagmites was amazing, and they did a great job with the lighting. I read some other reviews here and we brought our flashlights and were so glad we did! It was nice to be able to light up parts that aren't lit, and to point at features with my light when I was trying to point out a feature to someone. It was cool, but not cool enough that any of us needed a sweater or jacket as we walked. My big girls did the Junior Ranger program and like showing off their Ranger pins.","August 3, 2015","Amazing views, fun walk with kids",31,"Tyler, Texas",5

Big Room,The name does not deceive. This is a very big room. It is the largest single room in a cavern in America according to the literature. This is a pretty easy hike from the underground rest area. I recommend walking in the entrance and then touring the Big Room. If thats to much walking then take the elevator and start from the rest area. There is a short cut that still lets you see most of the room without going down the whole trail.

The trail is well paved, and mostly flat except for a few undulating sections (which are those not suitable for wheel chairs). There are also 2 or 3 places to sit and rest along the way. Thanks to the handrails that go all along the 1.25 mile path, she was able to walk the whole way without assistance. The path can be quite busy, and groups come by in bursts because of the elevator, but people were polite and we still had a great time.

The path is steepish in places but completely paved and has hand rails. We took the self guided tour so we could go at our own pace. Signs at the top say no drinks or food allowed, so we discarded our bottles of water, but when you are in the cavern it states that you can take water which could have been made clearer.

Big Room,"Visiting the Carlsbad Caverns has long been on my bucket list. Finding myself in Albuquerque for a week got me close enough to make the trek to Carlsbad for a visit to the caverns. I expected to really like the caverns, but was floored by how much they exceeded all my expectations. There are elevators that take you the 750 feet down to the big room, but we opted to hike down from the cave mouth, a mile long adventure in its own right and one not to be missed. The big room is truly enormous, enough so to hold 6 football fields. Every possible formation of stalactites, stalagmites, and atypical cavern structures are present in the vast expanse, which is easily traversed on an appropriately lighted, paved pathway complete with hand rails. The path is over a mile and at every turn there is something yet more amazing. My only word of advice is to be sure to bring a good flash light since there are far too many formations for the Park Service to have illuminated them all. The other advisable item is a light jacket since the temperature year round is a chilly 56 degrees.","July 21, 2015",Truly one of the wonders of the world,227,"Jacksonville, FL",5

The caverns are lit to accentuate features and often the lighting was good enough that I didn't need to use my flash. In fact, it was better not to use the flash in many cases. The walkways are paved smoothly so it is easy to walk. Parts of the walkways can be wet but this did not hinder movement. The off season is, of course, the best time to be here if you don't like crowds. Some people find it hard to keep their voices down in the caverns, though most are so awed they naturally become quiet. With larger crowds I imagine it might be noisier here.

You just push the corresponding number as the signs throughout the cave. It kept us informed about what we were looking at.

Wear comfortable shoes, take your camera & water. Although you don't need it, the kids think it will be fun to bring flashlights next time. The elevators to go down to the big room stop at 2pm or 3pm, I can't remember. Just go to the website to find out. You don't want to get there late and miss out.

We appreciated the self guided aspect of the cavern since we arrived after the guided tours were finished around 2:30. The natural entrance closes at 2pm but elevator access is allowed until 3:30 (winter hours). The big room tour is 1-1/2 miles long and takes 1 - 2 hours, depending on how often you stop for pictures. Saw lots of interesting formations and were awed by the immense size of it. Only drawback is no lodging, so you have a 30 mile drive back to Canyon.

Big Room,If you have minimal time don't take the hike down the natural cavern but take the elevator down and just do the walk around the Big room. The staff on the front desk didn't explain that so we didn't have as much time in the Big Room as we would have liked. It's not to be missed - absolutely spectacular. I would advise taking a tripod for your camera to get the best shots. It's pretty dark down there.

Big Room,"My wife and I visited Carlsbad Caverns in September 2013 as part of a tour around New Mexico. We did a loop, stopping in Carlsbad as our last stop. When passing through, the largest draw to the area is the Caverns. It is breathtaking to be among the natural beauty of the caverns in one of the United States' largest cave systems. The Big Room has everything you would want in a cave: stalactites, stalagmites, fans, icicles, etc. We did the self-guided tour, and walked around ourselves. Don't miss the huge columns in the middle of the room. They are the stars of the show. :) One tip: if you are wheel-chair bound, be prepared to have a lot of the park closed off to you. The park is only semi-friendly to wheelchairs. I guess it is to be expected in a place like this, where the original explorers were on their hands and knees crawling around.","February 26, 2015","Second time around, and it still amazes me......",58,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5
Big Room,This self guided tour is gorgeous. We took our time and had a blast enjoying all of the variety of formations that appear in the caverns. The only challenging part of the huge crowds [even in February] on such a narrow pathway. We had to move aside several times to let people through and taking photos was challenging at times due to the crowds. This walk is a must do when you visit. I would recommend also doing a ranger led tour with fewer people/distractions to complement your visit. ,"February 25, 2015",Spectacular Caves... a bit crowded though,47,"Zionsville, Indiana",4
Big Room,"My family and I decided on a whim to take a trip to Carlsbad Caverns. It is about a two and a half hour drive from El Paso, so you can drive there, visit, and drive back in the same day. However, we decided to spend the night because we got a late start and the entrance ticket for Carlsbad Caverns is good for three days. We arrived with a few hours of time on our first day and took the elevator down. Our almost three year old son was scared when he first entered the elevator, but he was no longer scared after a few minutes of talking to after we got off of the elevator. Our four year old daughter was not scared at all. Because of the limited time on our first day, we saw the first quarter of the Big Room and the last quarter (we took the shortcut). It took us about an hour and it was outstanding. You have very few chances to see anything like this in your lifetime. Words simply cannot describe what it is like and pictures do not do it justice. Because we arrived in the afternoon, the crowds were dying out and it was not that busy at all. It seemed like that we were the only ones left in the caverns at about 3:45 or so in the afternoon.We arrived the next day somewhat early (around 9:00 AM). The weather was very cold and rainy (which later turned into snow). This, along with it being a Sunday morning, probably kept the crowds at bay because there were again not many people visiting. Because we had all day, we took the natural entrance into the caverns. It is not as great as the Big Room, but definitely worth taking (see my review). After the natural entrance, we had lunch in the Visitor Center. The food is nothing great, but they have a pretty good selection and the food I had was pretty solid. The Visitor Center also has plenty of bathrooms, a large gift shop, a relatively large bookstore, and some exhibits. This is also where you take the elevator down if you do not want to take the natural entrance down. We took the elevator down and toured the whole Big Room. The first quarter and last quarter are much better than the middle half, but it is still worth taking the whole tour.It is probably a once in a lifetime experience for most people and you should definitely make a visit if you are anywhere within a few hours radius. My father is visiting in a few months and we are going to bring him to see the caverns as well. It is not to be missed!","February 25, 2015",Words cannot describe it.,193,"Glen Allen, Virginia",5
Big Room,The cavern loop that goes in and around the Big Room can get crowed. It's best to go early. If you can get there early and be one of the first groups down the path then you can keep to yourself and not be bothered by others. Take plenty of water with you and bring a jacket. If you plan to take photos do yourself a favor and bring a real camera and a tripod so you can use longer exposures and not flash. Caverns and caves are not a flashes friend. Typically what you want to light is too far away anyway and so you ar just throwing light into the darkness. This can temporarily blind yourself or others around you in such a dark place. Also when down in the cavern and the big room be respectful of others and be quiet!

Entering the caves was breathtaking. I was in absolute awe pretty much the entire time I was there. The formations were just gorgeous.

Big Room,"You can reach this room via an elevator, or, as we did, walk down the long steep trail from the natural entrance. Words are totally inadequate to describe what you will see down there. Amazing doesn't come close! This room is large enough to hold 14 American football fields, but football would be impossible, because the room is filled with enormous stalactites and stalagmites. Some of them are 60 feet tall! The ceiling is nearly 300 above your head in places. You'll also see thousands of other strange formations, and deep pits. I was disappointed that the lighting did not appear to be as bright as it was during a visit in 2002, and a ranger told me some bulbs have not been replaced when they've burned out, but the park is working on improving that situation. I hope so. On this visit, the cave appeared more like a wild cave to me than a tourist cave. I wanted to see better! My wife said, ""Uh, it's a CAVE!"" but I was disappointed by the dim conditions, since I remembered better lighting a dozen years ago. The trail is long and winds up and down and around, and alongside steep pits in places, but the railings are very sturdy and the pavement is roughed up for good traction. Elevators to the surface were self-operated (at least in November), and ours stalled briefly shortly after take off! No one appeared to be staffing the little lunchroom/souvenir shop.

I decided to use the elevator rather than the natural entrance since I'm not feeling too well. It was fun to descend 750 feet down. The elevators have windows so you can see the carved out rock on your way down.I opted for the audio tour, which I don't know if I would've actually done if I had to do it again. however, once you are in there, the only thing to say is that this is mesmerizing.The different stalagmites and stalactites were just simply amazing. And in the big room, the space is overwhelmingly incredible. I was in awe the whole time.I would definitely recommend this for children of all ages or any adult.

It is so very quiet and peaceful down there. My advice is just take you time and enjoy this place. There are handrails all the way along and we weren't afraid of slipping or falling.

Let me tell you, my kids thought this was the coolest thing ever! I had to keep explaining to my 6 year old that this was in fact a ""real"" cave, not man made. It is almost crazy to believe that nature created this wonder all alone! I loved that there are rangers along the trail to answer your many questions. Did you know that the man who discovered the caverns did so by pursuing what he thought was a wild fire, the ""smoke"" he saw was actually millions of bats leaving the cave. Anyway, this is totally worth a visit no matter what your age! Advice #1 Don't miss the scenic stops along the way to the caverns, one of them is an indian cliff area which was really cool. #2 Wear tennis shoes or hiking boots so you can do the natural entrance or guided tours. #3 Remember a light jacket if you are prone to getting cold.

The 750ft elevator ride down kind of set the mood and the wide open gift shop area/cafeteria built in and around the rock was a nice surprise. We toured the Big Room at about 9:00am and had the entire cavern to ourselves! We could hardly believe the enormity of the room. The pathway lighting was unobstrusive and so did not take away from the ambiance of the walk. Many of the more interesting formations were lit along the pathway. We moved fairly briskly but I stopped for lots of pictures :) The only ""problem"" was there was no way to take a photo that captured the unbelievable size!! There was something remarkable about being in such an enormous space and I couldn't stop gaping! This cave is less 'active' than others we have been in...it is not wet (except for a couple of small pools of water) or drippy but is quite humid and cool (after the King's Palace tour at 10:30am we were chilled to the bone!). Overall a great experience. I know a big part of the experience for us was having the entire room to ourselves--we could imagine it was 90 years ago and we were the first explorers :)","August 28, 2014",So huge!,34,"Lethbridge, Canada",5

Spent about 2 hours between the hike down and looking at all the things in the big room. Visitor's center is nice and informative. The park rangers are also very nice. We also did a little walking around on some of the nature trails.

Big Room,"As a kid, I heard about Carlsbad Caverns and always wanted to visit so this was an absolute treat. Words do not adequately describe the formations. The walkway is wide so there is plenty of room to linger and take in all the details. We visited on a weekday in May which may have accounted for fewer people. The elevator ride is quick and makes this accessible to anyone. The rangers roaming around are very helpful and informative. Altogether stunning!","August 19, 2014",Life-long desire fulfilled,12,Peterborough,5
Big Room,"This is the most amazing national park I have ever been too. From the moment we began our walk down into the cave (which I highly recommend vs. elevator) I was in utter amazement! I felt as though I was entering a whole other world. Almost like if I could keep going I would be in the movie Journey to the center of the earth! The only this I slightly disliked was how damp the caves were, but that is to be expected and I should have wore more appropriate clothing ie. not sandals. The canverns is also a great value for families, only ten bucks! This is a very beautiful national park and I plan to come back when my children are older. I highly recommend this place!","August 12, 2014",A whole other world!,47,"Wiscasset, Maine",5
Big Room,"The Big Room is hard to describe in words. It's really even difficult to convey with photos. Visiting is really the only way you will understand how amazing this site truly is. We opted to ride the elevator down into the cavern (a short 3 minute ride). I was glad we chose this option, as the walk around Big Room takes about an hour, and I don't think my little kids would have help up for longer than that. The cavern is much cooler than the outside. I recommend bringing a light jacket! I was in shorts and a t-shirt and I was quite chilly.Note on claustrophobia: Before descending the 700 feet underground in the elevator, I had a bit of a moment. I was terrified that I was going to panic and feel incredibly claustrophobic in the cavern. The reality: the Big Room is so incredibly spacious, that once we started down the path, I had not qualms. It did not feel claustrophobic (at least to me).","August 7, 2014",Awe-inspring (with a note on claustrophobia),27,"Austin, Texas",5

I highly recommend the walk down into the cave versus riding the elevator both ways. The departure of all surface life and into the depths of a different universe is stunning. Our kids (5,7 and 10) loved it too! We cannot recommend this park enough!!","August 6, 2014",Other worldly,24,Cincinnati,5

Big Room,"After visiting several parks in Texas and New Mexico and sweating all day with many applications of sunscreen, this was a fantastic change! We spent 2 hours in an underground wonderland, walked 2.5 miles (about half of it down hill and the rest relatively flat) in 56 degree temps. It was amazingly refreshing and oh so beautiful!I struggle with my knees but, though there were somewhat steep downhill slopes at times, I didn't have any trouble. I also don't enjoy tight spaces but the spaces on the natural entry and in the big room had high ceilings (except in one or two small stretches) and we're open enough that I never felt any panic. We only did the self guided tour and were there on a day when there was light enough traffic that we could set our own pace, which was nice! We did pay extra for the audio wand but only purchased one and shared it. It definitely helped tell the story of the cavern and gave us greater appreciation of what we were viewing.We arrived in Carlsbad just before sunset and just in time to see the ranger presentation at the outdoor amphitheater leading up to the bat flight. We didn't actually go into the cavern until the next morning. (No worries! The bats hide far away from the areas visited by tourists. :) I highly recommend making the bat flight a priority! How often do you get a chance to see thousands of bats fly out of a cave in search of dinner? The presentation is informative and at a level kids can appreciate. The actual flight takes place right in front of the amphitheater. Most of the bats just fly by but a few circle back over head. I was a little apprehensive, picturing the opening credits of Scooby Doo, but it was much less intense and really enjoyable!","August 3, 2014",The Best Summer Hike EVER! ...and the bats,39,"Greensboro, North Carolina",5

Big Room,We found the Big Room tour truly amazing. Took the Natural Entrance down. Really gives you perspective as you go lower and lower into the cave. Fairly steep though and can be tough on the knees. Took us about 45 minutes to an hour to get to the bottom where there are restrooms and a snack bar plus the start of the Big Room tour. Walking the Big Room is much easier than the entrance walk down. We did the audio tour which was very informative. You can pay for that in the gift store before you head down. Price was $5. Wear good shoes and bring a jacket. It's chilly down below. The Big Room is gorgeous! You can take your time and really enjoy the cave.

It's a nice transition between the upper level and semi-dark cave. The trail is over a mile, but there are a couple of times where you can take shortcuts. The signage is excellent, and we would for sure have gotten lost without it. There are a lot of well lit displays, and you can take an audio tour as well.

It is hard to impress these two young world travelers who have been to Paris, London and Rome but these incredible natural caves put man made art and architecture to shame. Not once in the two hour, mile and a half walk from the Bat Cave to the Big Room to the Bottomless Pit did I hear one complaint. ( ok they did fuss a bit about the smelly bat guano at the cave entrance for a moment) There were ohhs and aaahs the whole way. They loved the spiky chandelier, and limestone cave speleothemes: columns, stalagmites and stalactites. They really wanted to explore the bottomless pit from the rickety old ladder from the 1920s. ( I was glad that was closed) . We took the elevator back up to the surface. While we waited they looked at the photos they took on their phones. And I looked on at awe as my normally unsmiling kids were smiling.We had ice cream at the gift shop on the way out. It was just a really enjoyable adventure.","July 15, 2014",Carlsbad should be called CarlsAwesome Cave,73,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4

This is the cave by which I judge all others. I have been to caves in (Mammoth Cave) KY, (Colossal Cave) AZ and (Longhorn Cavern) TX. Nothing compares to the size, beauty and quality of Carlsbad Caverns. You can take your time and wander through the cave on a very pristine path. This cave seems to be accessible to all. On my visit, smaller children 2-6 seemed to tire and become disinterested, making a fuss about half way through, so keep that in mind.

Big Room,"Incredible, beautiful, and amazing. If you're anywhere near SE New Mexico, this should be high on the to-do list. Taking the natural entrance down was a fantastic experience, but there are also elevators for those unable to descend (or go back up) very steep and winding inclines. What can I say? It's an amazing place - go! :) We also toured the King's Palace but were disappointed because the ranger actually talked too much, made people stop and stand in very specific spots for 5-10 minutes at a time, and they crammed 55 people on the tour, including several little kids who were whiney, tired, hungry, and/or bored, which was very understandable. The minimum tour age should be higher than 4 years old. Because of all this, it's not worth the additional fee to be in such a large group and not be free to stop, stand, or take photos where you want to, though I was very happy to give more money to one of our incredible national parks. Instead, do the self-guided tours - you'll have a much better time.","July 12, 2014",A Must See,20,Texas,5

However it is steep, but there are hand railings, so I think a vast majority of people can do it. Once you're in the caves, they are amazing! The stalagmites are unlike any I've ever seen before, and I've been in my fair share of caves.

Big Room,"Carlsbad Caverns National Park was a must-do on our cross country road trip. My husband had visited as a young boy and had often talked about descending 750 feet via elevator into the Big Room, the main cave at the park. This time, he was eager to hike in through the Natural Entrance. I was not as enthusiastic as he, especially since that route meant an hour of walking the equivalent of 79 stories down steep, narrow paths (BEFORE reaching the Big Room) with our 3 elementary school-aged children. However, they were game, so I was willing to give it a try. The Natural Entrance closes at 3:30 during the summer, so after eating a late lunch at the cafeteria, we hurried down the path to the Natural Entrance where a ranger briefed us on the site and rules (no touching the formations!) before inviting us to enjoy this wonder of nature. As the large, gaping hole on the side of the mountain greeted us, I was filled with a sense of adventure and was immediately glad that I had decided to take this route.Sparrows flitted and chirped around us, their scent unmistakable, as we entered. Eventually, the New Mexican sunshine that was lighting our way was completely blocked out. We wished then that we had thought to bring along a small flashlight, but our eyes adjusted to the dimly lit caverns. At times during the hike, I felt as if we were descending into the Mines of Moria in Middle-earth (Tolkien reference, for those of you who are non-geeks). The experience was at once eerie and fascinating, and the sheer immensity of the caves almost incomprehensible. Although it sounded intimidating at first, the hike itself, though very steep and slippery in spots, was not overly difficult. The hardest part was keeping our 5-year old from running downhill at full speed! There are handrails and frequent turn-outs to rest or just take in the atmosphere. The temperature was not too chilly, and we were comfortable in shorts, light jackets, and hiking sandals. It took us about an hour to reach the Big Room. There are restrooms and a concession stand available. We wanted to try something from the snack bar - just to say that we dined at 750 ft below the Earth's surface - but by the time we got around to it at the end of our tour, it was closed.It is suggested that visitors take an hour-and-a-half or so to do the full self-guided tour around the Big Room, but there is a short-cut if you have neither the inclination nor the time to do so. The paths are relatively flat, but a few spots are too narrow and/or steep for wheelchairs. Photography is allowed. The Big Room, vast and other-worldly in its beauty, became a little tiring for our younger children towards the end of the tour. To keep them amused, I started giving names to the all the different formations. One that I dubbed ""The Pinecone"" was actually called ""Rock of Ages."" So much for my stalagmite-naming skills! I, myself, was really awestruck by ""Top of the Cross"" (the ceiling of the Big Room at its highest point) but was disappointed by ""Bottomless Pit"" (spoiler alert: it's not bottomless).At the end of our tour, we rode the elevator back up into the Visitors' Center where little paper cups and a pitcher of ice-cold water with lemon slices was waiting for anyone who needed some refreshment. Nice touch! It was a pleasant way to end an amazing visit!","July 4, 2014",Absolutely Amazing!,38,"Arcadia, California",5

Big Room,"We visited the Big Room via self-guided tour, walking down through the Natural Entrance. The walk to the Big Room took us about an hour. It is a little strenuous, not too bad, and has just a couple of spots with low overhead. I wouldn't recommend walking down with small children because there are some ledges that drop a little and also patrons are not allowed to touch anything in the caverns (it's pretty tempting!). The park has done a great job lighting and marking and explaining many of the more unique formations. A ranger stopped to point out a fossil along the path. Once you get to the Big Room, there are different paths you can take depending on how much you want to see. The walk around here is much easier. The formations are impressive, difficult to describe, but definitely worth the visit. We walked the large loop and stopped at a few features, we spent maybe a little more than an hour. Photography is allowed and turns out fairly decent. There is a restroom, gift & snack shop inside the cavern. It is about 55 degrees inside and pretty humid. Shorts were fine, but we wore jackets too. Took the elevator back up. The whole tour took about 2.5 hours then we came back in the evening for the amazing bat flight.","June 21, 2014",Lots to see,6,"McKinney, Texas",5

We had someone near us with a monstrous flashlight, so we had to get away from him (DON'T BRING A HUGE FLASHLIGHT, it ruins it for everyone else).

My husband, aunt and young son arrived around 9am and decided to do the self tour, without audio guide assistance. The woman who took our admission and gave us our map recommended that we take the elevator down instead of the natural entrance hike in because it was pretty strenuous and with a four year old, it might have been too steep. We rode the ranger operated elevator down, and were able to stroll around and look at the awe inspiring caverns and formations at our leisure. There is scenic lighting throughout the cavern which accentuates the natural beauty of the formations while keeping the atmosphere dim like a cave is supposed to be. You just lose track of time wandering around; my aunt found it at times a little disorienting, but nothing to dissuade our meandering. Back up in the visitor's center, there is a large gift shop with a variety of items that seemed to be a good value, as well as a bookstore and little snack bar/restaurant. We bought several items in the shops, including a miner's hat complete with working lamp for my son!

Big Room,"This was a very easy tour. We have a National Parks pass, so after paying $5 for an audio guide we took a very quick elevator ride down 750' to the cavern entrance. The audio device is easy to share and the trail is clearly marked. There are handrails and enough lighting to keep self - guided tourists on the right path. There is a shortcut available for those who don't have the time or the energy to make the entire 1.25 mile loop. It was very interesting, and we made the entire trip including elevator rides in less than 2 hours. You can also opt to hike down into the cavern or return to the Visitor Center through the Natural Entrance Route, but it will add an hour or more each way to do so.There are ranger-guided tours available, some of which are much more strenuous, but they were all filled up for the day. You need to make reservations at least 48 hours in advance to guarantee a spot on one of the more adventurous ranger guided tours.

It is a self guided tour but I highly recommend shelling out the $5 for an audio stick that you can use throughout the cavern areas (purchased in the Visitor Center Gift Shop). The formations in this large area (22nd largest in the world I believe) was truly amazing. We were lucky and the crowd was fairly small which provided ample space to stroll along, shoot pictures and listen to the audio recordings for each stop.

We stayed in Roswell because the hotels in Carlsbad were very expensive, so it was about an 1 1/2 drive to get there. It was not yet crowded at the visitor center, but many of the tours had already been sold out. We're fairly independent travelers so we decided to just rent the audio guide ($5) and hike down to the Big Room via the Natural Entrance. We were screened for White-nose syndrome and again used our senior NPS pass to gain entrance. It was a short hike to the entrance and we were greeted by swallows swooping around. We descended on a switchback trail into a dimly-lighted cave world. There were markers along the way, but we enjoyed the additional commentary on the audio and thought it was worthwhile. Because of the dim light, we used the handrails quite frequently, but didn't find the hike very strenuous. This path eventually led us to the Big Room with all its interesting features. It took an additional hour to walk the circular route in the Big Room, but there are a few signs if you wish to exit early.The size of this room is amazing and we enjoyed the varied features like the fairy forest, the bottomless pit and others. We were going to complete our hike by walking back up to the entrance, but because of time constraints, we took the elevator back up. We enjoyed our hike in these huge caverns and were glad we came. To top it off, we passed a curled up rattlesnake on the road as we were driving out of the park. By the time we turned around to snap a photo, he had disappeared.

I love caves of course, and I love being able to walk around for 1 1/2 hours in a cave like you can in the Big Room. We have 5 children, and to be honest, it was scary in some places, if they happened to try climbing off the walkway, and falling into a big hole. Not the Cavern's fault of course, but just a warning to keep your eyes on them at all times. Mine do mind me, but we know what ""killed the cat."" It does get very crowded at times, and a lot of people seem to be in a hurry. The walkways are large enough for people to pass if using a wheelchair, thought there is an area towards the middle of the tour that wheelchairs cannot access because of the steepness, and have to turn around and go as far as they can before another no wheelchair access sign, and you have to go back the way you came from to get back on an elevator, as the normal exit is climbing. The naturalness is there, even has ""natural-like lighting"" to see the beauty.

Big Room,"Okay, it's a pain to get to Carlsbad but the caves are well worth the trip. We've seen quite a few caves in the US and Europe but the Big Room is quite unique. As you walk the loop the scenery keeps changing in amazing ways. We spent about three hours doing the self guided tour and were a bit tired at the end but the walk isn't strenuous at all. If you have less time take the elevator straight down to the Big Room. ","April 13, 2014",Spectacular,116,"Sudbury, Massachusetts",5
Big Room,We went for a day trip and it was awesome. My kids were so impressed. It truly is Something everyone should see once in their life.

Big Room,"My wife and I are really impressed with what the Park Service has done with Carlsbad Caverns. Age has taken a bit of a toll on us and we can't walk like we did in our 20's, but we still have the desire to see things. With the elevator to the big room, the railings on the main trails through the caverns and attention to things that assist the people with special needs, the Park Service hit a home run for us. We spent nearly two hours roaming the big room at our pace and saw some of the most beautiful creations of nature. When we finally emerged from our treck, we headed straight for the restaurant. They don't have an extensive menu, but what they did have was quality and delicious.. The park is well worth the visit. Only thing to improve is the signage on the main highway. We almost missed the turn to the park.","March 31, 2014",Excellent job by the Park Service,283,OLYMPIA,5
Big Room,"We visited the Carlsbad Caverns the third week in March of 2014 and it was amazing. We walked in through the Natural Entrance, which is about a mile walk down into the cavern. The 1 mile walk down into the cavern really enhanced our ability to appreciate the caverns--I am sure that taking the elevator down is nice too, but the walk down through the natural entrance really helps you to appreciate just how big, deep and amazing the caverns are and we were REALLY glad that we had done that and think that you really have a different experience if you just take the elevator down and back up again. If you take the natural entrance, be sure to wear appropriate footwear. We did take the elevator back up because we didn't want to walk up hill for a mile. We also ate at the picnic area at the visitor center, which was great too--the tables were nice and clean and the view was spectacular.","March 28, 2014",Amazing!,5,"Middleton, Wisconsin",5
Big Room,"After reading lots of reviews, I may have had my expectations built up too much. Parts of the cave are beautiful but a lot of it felt very touristy. I went on a slow day but were lots of people blocking the path. It actually felt more like being in a line at a Disney Park than a national park. If you go, would definitely recommend booking a tour to get off the beaten path.","March 21, 2014",Disappointing,12,"Boston, Massachusetts",3
Big Room,We had lived in the area when our kids were small but moved away. We came back to CCNP for spring break this year because they were old enough now to be able to appreciate this wonderful place. The park was very busy and crowded but the staff had everything set up and getting tickets and into the cave was smooth. The only exception was the closure of the 2 big elevators. They were down for maintenance and resulted in a 20 minute wait to get back out. The kids (and parents) loved going back down into the natural entrance and had a great time. I am sure they will remember the trip forever. The both did the Jr. Ranger program and Ranger Ellen was great. She took time to talk with each girl and made their trip.,"March 20, 2014",I never get tired of coming to the park,38,"Poplar Bluff, Missouri",5

Big Room,"We had a tour arranged and the day before we took it, we headed out near the end of the day and took the elevator down, walked the great room loop and just made the cut off time for the walk up through the natural entrance. It is a steep hike back up, but worth the effort. The natural formations in the cave are beautiful with the strange, organic shapes formed by the slow dripping of mineral laced water. It is about 56 degrees in the cave, so come prepared with warmer clothing AND go walking shoes. Carlsbad Caverns is on the list of natural wonders to see in the Southwest. Do not miss this amazing place if you are in the area. If you can, do not stay in Carlsbad because most rooms are very expensive.","March 16, 2014",Awesome natural attraction,539,"Sedona, Arizona",5
Big Room,"This part of the cavern is a must see, thus the elevator and the easy pathway on it. Our kids enjoyed the audio tour wand that gives more information about different features in the room. We hiked in the natural cave entrance, which I suggest doing (even our 4 year old did it and still made the mile long trek around the Big Room). The beauty of the natural entrance is something you don't want to miss. Were were happy to jump in the elevator for the quick ride back up, though.As a side note, we thought there would be a bigger selection of food at the rest station underground. There were a few sandwiches and some prepackaged cookies, but that was it. We had a few trail bars and ate them (despite the sign saying 'No outside food') and I would suggest similar things like trail mix or bars. It was lunchtime and our kids were hungry after hiking in. I think it took is over 3 hours to do the whole thing.","March 15, 2014",Cool!,2,"The Woodlands, Texas",5
Big Room,"Unfortunately we arrived at 2:10 and was not able to take the Natural walk to the big room but we took the elevator . We went when it wasn't busy so it's almost like being there alone. It was fascinating, breathtaking views, amazingly huge !! The temperature if 58 degrees was not bad at all. All the staff were very helpful. We went to the opening if the bat cave around 5:15 and saw swallows coming out but we were too early in the season to see the bats. I would recommend to spend at least the day there so you can get in hiking and the scenic drive.","March 8, 2014",Must see! ,83,"Jupiter, Florida",5

There are almost 50 points of interest covered by the audio tour.Wear a light jacket or sweatshirt, as it will be mid-50's down there.If you plan to hike back up to the Natural Entrance, verify with the Rangers when you have to leave the Big Room because they do close the trail before the park closes.Allot an hour to hike down and another one to two hours to explore the Big Room; time depends on group size and interest level. You could breeze through the hike and Big Room in under two hours.","March 5, 2014",Take the Natural Entrance to the Big Room,35,,5

They are well worth the effort, which unfortunately is harder to bear these days. This was our second trip to the Caverns, and 15 years ago Carlsbad was a quaint NM town. Now, it is a ""boom town"" which translates into an industrial blight. Hundreds of ""frac"" wells dot the landscape and Carlsbad, the only town within 30 minutes of the Caverns, is overrun with leathernecks and industrial supply depots. As a result, hotel prices have doubled (for same mediocre options) and tourists are now second class to the cash laden Halliburton crowd. ","February 23, 2014",Epic. Breathtaking.

Big Room,"We decided last minute to visit Carlsbad Caverns. It was beautiful and not disappointing. We took a major detour just to see the Caverns from Albuquerque NM heading to Austin TX, arriving at 3:24pm and they told us we needed to be in the elevator by 3:30pm… Soo we made it just in time, the staff was amazing and very helpful. Looking up and figuring out how to walk at the same time was a little dizzy but really cool regardless. Traveling with a 13, 8, & 6 year old they enjoyed the caverns so much the couldn't decide if it was Batman's bat cave or Supermans cave of crystals. pictures didn't do the cave any justice. We loved it and would totally recommend it to others out there. This is a National Park so if you are military entrance is free.","February 10, 2014",Beautiful & breath taking.

Big Room,"Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico was a must see for us. We took the elevator down 750 ft. and entered the “Big Room”. My two youngest kids bought miner hats and my oldest, who was too cool for a miner hat, purchased a head lamp (the miner hats were way cooler though). They turned then on and we were off on an underground adventure. The Big Room's annual temperature is in the 50's. The paved pathways have railings and there are few benches through out the tour. The Big Room self-guided tour was great for us because we were visiting for the first time and we had young children. It allowed us to be astonished at our own pace. We were at ease and left alone to marvel at these magnificent natural sculptures. It was a real treasure to enter into nature’s museum of frozen waterfalls, caverns that draped the cave, enormous cones and towering spears. The Big Room did not disappoint at all!

Big Room,"Visited the caverns on a Saturday in January arriving to the visitors center at 9:00 am. The Visitors Center is a 30 minute drive from Carlsbad, New Mexico. Purchased the audio guide for $5 and opted to enter via the Natural Entrance, a walk into the cavern from ground level. The walk in is a very steep paved path with hand rails into the mouth of the cave. It took a leisurely 1 hour 15 mins to reach the Big Room area. Due to the off season we enjoyed the walk down having the cavern to ourselves. This was nice as sound travels and we were able to enjoy the sounds of the cave without hearing human voices. There are restrooms and a small snack shop where bottled water was purchased and the elevators to and from the visitors are located in this area. A short walk back to the 'intersection' of trails led to the big room path. This loop was completed in an enjoyable 1 hour 20 minutes at a leisurely pace.The facilities at the visitors center included two gift shops, a small cafe, and clean restrooms. The employees were very friendly both at the center and in the cavern. The rangers are stationed in various locations along the cavern trails to answer questions and point out unique features. No guided tours were taken on this visit, however there was availability on all the tours on this day. The cavern itself is a constant 56 F and humid in some areas so layered clothing is recommended. The famous bat exit event is not available from approximately October thru March due to the bat annual migration, so this was unfortunately missed on this visit. This was a thoroughly enjoyable, educational, and entertaining day. The audio guide is highly recommended and worked well. The signage was adequate through out the cavern and on the entrance trail, however the audio provided much more information. No food was purchased during this visit. There are strict rules regarding conduct in this attraction, as there should be. This is a World Heritage Site and is well worth the effort to visit this natural world wonder. As a side note; This visit was a break from an extended business event in the Calrsbad NM, area. Due to the recent oil boom the lodging in this area is very expensive. difficult to find, and with all the workers somewhat family unfriendly. The caverns are about a 1 1/2 hour drive from El Paso, TX, the next major lodging location. There is at least one motel in White City NM, near the park entrance, as well as some tourist dining options.","January 12, 2014",a natural wonder of the world,2,"Ahwatukee, Arizona",5

The cavern is breathtakingly beautiful and well worth the drive, the time, and the effort. Lighting is very low, of course, and I should have prepared my camera and read the manual a bit more to get better shots before going down.

The park has done a wonderful job showing off all of the formations within this very large cavern. We have been to another cavern and were astounded by the size of this one. It is worth taking the time to see wish we would have booked another tour, but they were sold out. You can pre book tours up to 6 months out, they say. Very inexpensive. I'm very claustrophobic but made it through. Would highly recommend. ","December 28, 2013",Amazing!!!!,33,"Prescott, Arizona",5
Big Room,"The Big Room is...big. The rangers say that it's over 1.5 miles around, but I easily spent 4 hours to do the complete loop taking pictures. The most beautiful parts are the in first half of the trail, so if you or your party get bored, take the second shortcut at the Chandelier and the Totem Pole and skip Lower Cave and the Bottemless Pit. Go earlier in the day so there are fewer people to detract from the silence and isolation. For photographers, tripods are allowed (and necessary), though the trail is somewhat narrow so you'll have to be polite and let people past.Plan on doing the Big Room, go on the King's Palace tour, and hike down from the Natural Entrance. This will easily take a day and a half unless you plan to hit the park right when the cave opens.","December 13, 2013",One day is not enough,90,"New Haven, CT",5
Big Room,"On a recent trip to New Mexico, my husband and I visited the Carlsbad Caverns National Park. We didn't take one of the guided tours, but decided to do the self-guided tour of the Big Room. It was pretty cool room. I think it was a 1.3 mile walk, but it seemed longer. Parts are not wheelchair accessible due to the steep inclines and declines. The temperature in the cavern was quite mild and humid. There's bathrooms in the caverns near the elevator and a cafe of sorts in the cavern near the elevator. Only plain water is allowed to be carried on the tours. Food is to be eaten at the tables near the cafe. At the surface, there is a cafeteria, gift shop and bathrooms. There's also the Walnut Canyon Desert Drive that's about 9 miles long. I wasn't too impressed with the drive. The road is unpaved and is not made for low riding cars. Good time and I'm glad we went. FYI - the road between White Sands National Park and Carlsbad Caverns goes through Texas and past the Guadalupe Mountains National Park. It was a good place to stop for bathrooms. There was a little museum, but it looks like the park is mainly a hiking park.","December 8, 2013",The Big Room is just that...,120,"Placitas, New Mexico",5
Big Room,"I wrote a more detailed review of all of this in Natural Entrance section, but one big tip - be the first down the elevator in the morning and explore the Big Room first. We did and it made it a lot cooler. Imagine being 750 feet down in a cave with pretty much nobody else. Stone quiet down there and you can explore at your own pace. You really don't realize how the presence of other people degrades it until they start showing up and the flashbulbs and voices change the experience.","November 28, 2013",A tip - be first in the cave in the morning.,271,"Decatur, Georgia",5
Big Room,We added this to our Cross country adventure and we were not disappointed. If you take the elevator down it is nice and bright with glass on the sides to watch the rock go by. You travel 750 feet down in the ground and my wife who is very claustrophobic had no problem with the ride down. It doesn't take long at all. Once inside you see why it is referred to as the big room. It is over a mile to just walk around the room. There is wheel chair access to part but not all of the walkways due to the steep inclines. It is just hard to imagine that you're inside the ground because it just so big. The formations are beautiful.

Carlsbad Caverns eats those for breakfast and poops out stalagmites.I paid for the Kings Palace tour, which was okay, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it again. Probably better for kids than adults. Our ranger seemed to have gotten her jokes from some dusty pamphlet left in the cave a hundred years ago. Yeesh. It was kind of cool to experience the total darkness when she shut off the lights.The real treat was doing the self-guided hike down into the cave and through the Big Room. They call it the Big Room for a reason, people. It is *big.* Seriously, some of the most incredible things I've ever seen. Huge stalagmites, crazy twists and turns, bottomless pits! You could spend hours down here.Sadly, they suggested most of the bats had migrated by the time I was there (late October), so I didn't stick around for the bat show. I wish I could have seen it, though. I bet that is the kind of thing you remember on your deathbed. Especially if bats are eating you to death.The caverns are in the middle of *nowhere,* so make sure you have plenty of gas for the ride there and back.Go! Enjoy the alien landscape beneath our feet!

Nothing! The natural beauty, and the way it has been displayed by the National Parks staff is unbelievable. It all just takes your breath away. And at a price of ten dollars a person, what more can one wish?In addition to the caverns, the visitors center is set out very well. It is clean, well staffed, and priced reasonably in the great gift shop and the bookstore. The cafe has a good menu and the prices good.Even the parking lot and the washrooms deserve a mention, because they too couldn't be better or cleaner.Last of all, the Parks staff. Unbelievably knowledgable and polite.Everything at this attraction gets a five star!Only thing wrong was myself. I had this crazy thought I was going to photograph the caverns with my pocket Canon. Wrong I should have brought my Nikon, SLR digital with it's add-on flash.

So if you missed out on any of the tours, or say have only a few hours to spare..this calls for a great trip. Some of the other places I have been that have self guided tours, usually cover only a fraction of the paid tours in terms of features and area, but this really is a handful.-The accessibility is very good. I started walking from the natural entrance end which by the way merges into the Big Room, and took the elevator back! Perfect! - Full of what you expect in a cave!

I paid for the Left Hand Tunnel Tour and the Kings Palace Tour which are both worthwhile, but the Big Room, which is free (expect for the main admission of course), is the very best part to see. DO NOT MISS IT if you are planning your day. I almost did because the paid tours I signed up for took up most of the day. Fortunately the line up for the elevator was so long at the end of the day that visiting hours were extended so I was able to walk the full Big Room. Unbelievable!!!

Those caverns were ""pretty"", this room was just ""big"". Glad I went, wouldn't again unless I was with someone who had never seen them. THANK YOU for having a dog kennel. More National Parks should have them!The kennel is in the storage room for the gift shop but I felt comfortable leaving my two dogs there. Price was fair- $6 per dog. There was no way for anyone but the shop staff to get to the dogs. They got water and were locked in fairly securely. BRING YOUR OWN BLANKET OR BED! The only negative in my opinion is that the floors are slotted, so you have to take off their collars/tags so they don't get stuck. Smart, except if god-forbid they got out, I'd only have to rely on their microchips... and people's astuteness to check for that.","August 6, 2013","Awe-inspiring, but where's the beauty?

Big Room,"The Big Room in Carlsbad Caverns is truly one of the wonders of the world. The underground room is probably the largest room you'll ever be in, and it's filled with cave formations. My favorite is probably the Chandelier, a collection of massive stalactites in the middle of the room. The paved trail is an easy walk, though you'll get sweaty because, while it's cool underground, the cave is a constant 56F at 90% humidity. Most of the trail is wheelchair-accessible, but there a few parts that are too steep (no stairs, just a somewhat steep grade).If you bring a camera, be aware that it's not easy to take pictures in the extremely low light. You can use a flash if you want (please don't blind other visitors!), but the pictures won't come out well because there won't be any shadows for depth - I know, I've tried. If you're fortunate enough to have a *good* digital SLR, you can take pictures at high ISO with slow shutter speeds, which turn out great, like some of these that I took. I used a Canon 6D with a Gorillapod to wrap around the railing to steady the camera. If you just have a point-and-shoot, though, I suggest saving your time and buying postcards.One more thing: buy an America the Beautiful pass (http://www.nps.gov/findapark/passes.htm). The $80 is a great deal, and is good for a full year for most park admissions. In less than a week in New Mexico, we got $40 of admissions, and we'll use it often over the next year for parks closer to home.","August 5, 2013",Awe-inspiring experience,161,"Santa Cruz, California",5

Big Room,"Having been through a number of caverns throughout Texas and Missouri I decided to swing by the famous Carlsbad Caverns while in far West Texas. Compared to the systems I have been in, all I can say about Carlsbad is that is really large. Sorry but the caverns are just plain ugly in comparison to some of the cave systems in Texas such as Lone Star Caverns and the Caverns at Sonora. The problem is that as you can walk through here with no supervision and very few ranger patrols. People have touched to death the formations. Touching formations kills them and discolors them. In Texas you are not allowed into any of the touring caves unsupervised and are absolutely not allowed to touch. Those that do are prosecuted so the caves in Texas are very beautiful and still alive. Going to Carlsbad was just sad and comparatively unimpressive. I'm sorry but just something being really large is not enough to make me gush enthusiastic.We did the natural entrance, all of the unguided tour areas as well as a lantern tour. The lantern tour was nothing special - just a waste of time and money. Even in the guided part of the caverns utilized for the lantern tour the stone was just plain ugly.Very disappointing for a 9 hour round trip drive.","July 22, 2013","It's really, really big...and not much of anything else",141,"Houston, Texas",2

Needless to say, we were a bit tired, but the Big Room is a must. So if that is too much walking for a day, take the elevator the next day and do the tour. Your entrance ticket is good for 3-days! It is easily a 2 hour walk and so much to see. The walk is mostly flat, just long with one or two short uphills. There are places along the way to sit.

The rangers are all very knowledgeable and kind. All the young kids I saw there did not seem interested in the cave or all the walking, so this may be more suited for young teens and up. I recommend bringing a flashlight - but be respectful to others around you when using it as not to blind them. The cave is dimly lit and the flashlight helps with that. Also bring a jacket! It does get chilly the deeper you go.","June 27, 2013","Wow, fascinating!!! Don't forget a flashlight and jacket!!",8,Detroit,5
Big Room,"We spent almost 2 hours walking the self-guided tour. The cave is a consistent 56 or so degrees, and humid. The elevator down 750 feet is an experience, going through rock layers. There is also a natural entrance that is a walking entrance, but that entrance alone would take over an hour, so decide how you want to spend your time and get your exercise. We did not go back in the evening to see the bats emerging, but I would recommend doing this from the park ranger's description, and we'd see this if we went to Carlsbad again.","June 27, 2013",Spectacular natural site,33,"Ipswich, Massachusetts",5

Maybe some of the other caves in the world might have one of two spectular formations, but the Big Room has many. the complete tour around the perimeter of the Big Room will take about an hour to transverse the 1.3 miles. About 2/3 of the path is wheel chair accessible. Well worth the time to get to Carlsbad, as it is far of the main freeway route. Take the hike down the Cavern entrance and use the elevator to come back up.

My 3-year-old lost steam after walking around the Big Room...and I don't think that even my 5-year-old would have been able to handle the other tours. However, the Big Room is a ""go at your own pace"" type of deal, and the boys (and I) love seeing all of the different parts of the cave. (Of course, keep in mind that it's a cave...so it's nothing flashy or ""exciting""...but it IS a pretty spectacular sight).

The formations are absolutely stunning. This was by far the most impressive cave I've ever been in. I've got a basic (and cheap) point and shoot digital camera. None of my pictures of the caverns turned out very good, due to the low lighting in the cave (they try to keep it as natural as possible). I'm guessing you need a professional camera if you want to get really good pictures. We got to the Big room via the Natural Entrance about an hour after it opened. Not many other people were in the Big Room yet, which made it eerie and wonderful, and very quiet. As we were leaving a big group came in with yelling kids, so I was glad we toured the room when we did.  Near the Big Room's elevator is a small snack bar, and the restrooms. We took the elevator back up to the surface, and only had to wait about three minutes for the elevator.

The late afternoon visit was much less crowded and good for picture taking.

We only had time to walk around the ‘Big Room’ where we oohed and aahed at the various formations. The brochure showed many more guided tours for visitors with a little bit of an adventurous spirit. We would have loved to have tried some of the ‘down & dirty’ caving if time allowed. I wish we would have been travelling during the bat occupation of the caves.

We were there too early to see the bat flights - that is our only regret! The recording was repetitive if you do both the self-walk down to the cave and the self-tour of the big room - but I recommend it if you don't have time to take a tour with a guide - which I highly recommend. Young children may have trouble walking these distances, but older children will manage it well - and with so much to see, it keeps their interest! As always, parents should prepare kids with information/education so they really understand how deep they are! Safe, tied, comfortable shoes (no flip-flops) and layers are best - as you walk and hike, you get hot, even though the temperature is cool.The kitchen had a problem, lunch choices were limited, but staff was very kind and patient.- If you have been to other caves, be sure to wear different shoes and let the staff know so they can swab your camera - we want to keep this cave healthy and virus-free! - TAKE EXTRA DISKS AND BATTERIES (yes, I'm yelling!) - I forgot my extra battery and was unable to take as many pictures as I would have liked to.

The formations are beautiful and there is a variety of them: stalactites, stalagmites, straws, draperies, columns... They are all amazing. The King's Palace tour is very interesting to do.

Mind you, you are more than 70 stories under the surface.I didn't do the bat tour, I would have had to wait until dusk which I didn't want to since I was done with the caverns by 3pm. But I took the 9m scenic loop on my drive back down to White City and since nobody else did it, I had time to stop various times and take some nice pictures of plants that I don't have back home;)If you can, visit the Caverns in the spring. They say there are easily 2-3hrs waiting lines in the summer. One more thing, the famous underground restaurant wasn't open, but I didn't mind. I think it's a pity when that is the thing that stands out in many tourist's memory. I id have a burger in the upstairs restaurant behind the gift shop. I was not impressed at all.

If you are in decent shape, take this entrance as opposed to the elevator. It is such a unique way to enter and you will see parts of the cave that you don't see on other tours. It is steep and long, though. I got the audio guide for $5 but honestly most of the boards in the room gave similar explanations. We spent about an hour walking down and about an hour in the big room. I also recommend bringing a small flashlight for walking in darker areas and highlighting areas not lit. There are bathrooms and a restaurant at this level. Because we finished by 11:30am we were able to ride up the elevator with only a 5 minute wait.

However, the nps.gov website does mention about the 12 degree temperature drop between the surface and the Big Room.After a 750-feet hike going down the nicely paved trail, we reached a flat area which was the entrance to the Big Room. From there, we already had a glimpse of how amazing the place was. As we walked through the room, we were completely awed by how big the space is at such depth and how amazing the giant stalactites, stalagmites are. The provided lighting was really great since it gave ability for visitors to really absorb the nature wonder.","January 23, 2013",A mesmerizing place,42,Dallas,5

Big Room,"My family of six (including four young children) visited Carlsbad Caverns Nat'l Park on our way north to Colorado. Even though its about a 20 minute drive off the highway, it was great! You hear and read about Carlsbad in school, but that doesn't properly prepare you for the subterranean wonder of this place. Some of the pictures on TripAdvisor do well at capturing a glimpse of the spectacles, but you have to go yourself! The admission is affordable, and NPS offers special discounts for older folks, military, handicapped, etc.Also, the Big Room is handicapped accessible, so our daughter was able to enjoy God's wonderful handiwork as well!","January 13, 2013",Subterranean Wonder,53,,5
Big Room,"Keep on eye on your time here - we almost arrived too late to enter and then we had to wait an entire HOUR in line to go up the elevator back out of the park, during which time, our three year old just fell asleep and had to be carried through the line. It's really beautiful and very interesting at first, but the hike is pretty long and we were all totally ready to hit the road about 2/3 of the way into it and you can't - you just have to complete the hike. I think if I had known, I would have picked the short-cut option you encounter earlier in the hike. We were a group of grandparents, parents and kids, so for very small children the longer version of the tour is a little too much darkness and walking.","January 9, 2013","Beautiful, unique",260,American in Bogota,4

Big Room,"We only had a couple of hours, so the Big Room was perfect. We have seen other amazing caverns in Puerto Rico and Virginia but nothing comes close. The sheer size and scope of Carlsbad are unmatched. We stretched the self guided tour to over two hours with the audio guide, plenty of pictures and peering through binoculars and it felt just right. If we had more time we would have loved to do the Kings Room guided tour. No bat flights at this time of year and two of their four elevators do not work..will apparently take a year to fix because there's some dispute with the contractor who is supposed to be fixing them (according to one of the rangers). Result: be prepared for long waits especially to leave the cavern at the end of the day.","December 29, 2012",Superlative natural wonder,80,"Derwood, Maryland",5

Big Room,"These two parks are close together and can easily be seen in one trip. Collectivey I give them four stars. The caverns are the best I've seen. Mammoth Cave is the world's longest cave system but is rather bland and colorless. By contrast Carlsbad has a great deal of variety and different colors and formations. It has enormously high rooms and the evening bat flight out of the cave. In short, Carlsbad is what a cave trip should be.Nearby Guadalupe Mountains National Park is a nice park as well. We did a day trip from Carlsbad so didn't camp here. We hiked McKittrick Canyon for a few hours. We were there just before Thanksgiving and seemed to hit the fall colors almost perfectly.I wouldn't come here in the summer because of the terrible west Texas heat, but fall or spring should be really nice. From here we went to Balmorhea State Park, TX to complete a nice 4-night loop in the TX/NM border area. This is a nice area for a long weekend. I probably won't do it again as it is 6 hours from our home in north Texas, but I'm glad we did it once.","December 27, 2012",Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains,30,Keller,4
Big Room,"I came here with my girl when we were taking a tour of the southwest. We couldn't believe how big this cavern was. I've been on several cave tours, but this was my girlfriend's first. Even though I've seen a lot of caverns, this was definitely the most impressive because of its size. You can take an elevator down to the room, or you can go through the natural entrance. There are so many formations and interesting features that it takes some time to absorb it all. That pathway is circular, so it is easy to see everything if you take your time. The tour is self guided, but we did get the audio guide, which I think really helped us to enjoy it more. I took a lot of pictures, but some of them are hard to see because I didn't have the settings right. The cavern is lit just right so that the formations are perfectly enhanced, and you won't feel as though you are just seeing one stalactite after another. They are all amazing. When you figure in that over 6 football fields can fit into that one cavern, it's hard not to walk away impressed.","December 12, 2012",Breathtaking,2,"Detroit, Michigan",5
Big Room,"We spent 2 days (1 night) at Carlsbad. The first afternoon we did the self-guided tour of the Big Room. We highly recommended paying the $5 for the audio tours, there are about 40 points of interest that are explained on the audio. The experience is amazing - absolutely stunning - hard to believe you are 750 feet below ground. There is an elevator to take you down the 750 feet. You walk at your own place plan on about 2 hours. There are rest rooms in the cavern at the beginning of the tour.The second day we went on the guided King's Palace tour - we booked the tour on our arrival as they do fill up. The guide is a park ranger, he was highly informative - you go down about another 85 feet, not steep and the pace was nice so you that the slower people in the group could keep up. It is stunning and well worth the admission fee.Somewhere new we plan to take house guests in the future.","December 11, 2012",Carlsbad Caverns,83,"Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada",5
Big Room,"Absolutely stunning natural beauty. The room is 700 feet underground and chock full of beautiful natural formations. It'll take about an hour to walk around the whole room and see it all.

The audio tour, available at the visitor's center for a small fee, is absolutely worth it.","December 9, 2012",The highlight of every visit,78,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",5
Big Room,"The Big Room has amazing geological features. This self-guided tour is a one-way loop path (though you could turn around if you really needed to) that is mostly handicap-accessible. It is clearly marked where the path is no longer handicap accessible (the rail pitches inward to block the path of wheelchairs). There are NOT many signs along this walkway. If you're interested in learning about the age of the caverns, how they were formed, etc, definitely read the National Park Service brochure and pick up the ""ranger in a handset"" little recorded tour thing for $5 in the visitor's center. Otherwise, the signs are few and far between. Bathrooms are located at the beginning of the path. Not strenuous at all, self-paced. It's 50 something degrees down there, but I was fine in a long-sleeved shirt (no hat/scarf/gloves needed!). Definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.","November 25, 2012","Self-paced, mostly handicap accessible",18,"Baldwinsville, New York",4
Big Room,"My husband and I are working toward our goal of seeing all the National Parks so we stopped here just because it was on our list. We are not big fans of cave tours, however, once we started heading down the long walk into the bowels of the cave, we could see why this place is such a treasure. It is truly a spectacular place and one of the highlights of this trip. The Natural Entrance walk is steep but paved, dry and safe. If you have bad knees I would avoid it, but don't be put off by the description. It's definitely worth doing as part of your tour of the Big Room.","November 24, 2012",What an amazing place!,7,"Wethersfield, Connecticut",5
Big Room,"First of all-- we do alot of photography on our road trips so caverns have never really had an appeal for us-- however, we decided this year that it needed to be seen. WHAT a great place! We opted to do only the natural entrance and the big room since it was covered under the park's pass. The natural entrance is a mile and 1/2 trip in-- all downhill-- a bit hard on the knees, so beware! Really cool, tho! The big room was just awesome!!!! Otherworldly! Took our tripods and got some great shots. Spent 5 hours between the 2, but probably took us longer than most since we were shooting. Just a great surprise for us. DIdn't realize how much we'd love caverns.","November 21, 2012",awesome!,304,Ohio,5

Big Room,"The Big Room is one of the most wonderous things I have ever seen. You could walk around for hours, days, weeks, etc and still see new things. You can access through the Natural Entrance or through a quick elevator ride. It is around 750 feet below the surface. They have done a great job with the accent lighting in the cave so that you can see some of the formations and speleothems (learned that word on the tour!) better. Definitely recommend coming to Carlsbad Caverns if you are able!","November 19, 2012",Seriously amazing,16,"Lewisville, Texas",5
Big Room,"We got to the Big Room via the Natural Entrance. After seeing all the formations all the way to get down here, we still had so much more to see and be awed. This place is absolutely beautiful. It looks like a giant amusement park only nature can create. Absolutely worth a visit. The entrance fee is very cheap considering what you'll be experiencing. We came in early November and there still some tourists, but not enough to feel cramped. It was perfect. Bring a light jacket because it's really cool once you get down here, and especially if you are going to take other guided tours to the deeper part of the caverns. We recommend getting here through the Natural Entrance (if you are able to do it) and go back up with the elevator.","November 15, 2012",Amazing! Must go!,56,"Simi Valley, CA",5

Big Room,"The Big Room was huge. It took us over 1 1/2 hrs. to view it at a good pace. Of course, I had to take a million photos while listening to the audio guide, so I guess you could complete the walk in 1 1/4 hrs. It was really hard to imagine exploration without the periodic electric lights and paths to walk. If you are stuck for time, at least take the self-guided tour of the Big Room. The entrance fee is only $6 for adults and if you are lucky enough to be over 62, buy a lifetime pass which is only $10. Your pass will get you and 3 other adults in free. Now you can't beat that. You can spend your savings on audio guide, which I highly recommend.There are several ranger guided tours but each has an additional fee.

We also stayed for the Bat Flight (bats flew out at 6:45pm - and we stayed for a 1/2 hr / they were still leaving!) After that, we took our time leaving the park, so we could enjoy the night sky, and the Milky Way.

With only the emergency spotlights to see we missed the rock formations on the last bit but could easily make our way to the exit.Even if you are just passing Carlsbad, take two hours to drive up to the visitor center, get the lift down and look around the big room.

Big Room,Highly recommend this National Park...especially on a hot summer day. The walk through the cavern alternates between interesting and stunningly beautiful. Very easy walk as much of it is downhill and it is nice and cool inside. One downside - the elevators are in the process of being updated and we stood in line for almost as long as we spent walking through the caverns. We stayed for the evening bat flight as well. They didn't swarm out that evening because of winds but seeing them come out by the hundreds (instead of by the thousands) was still worth watching. Great visit.,"September 4, 2012",Wow!!,30,Japan,5

There are several places where wheelchairs aren't able to pass and those can be slightly challenging for those who aren't in the best shape, but overall this was a great tour.

In fact the caverns had delayed their opening that morning due to the risk, but we arrived about 11am and it had reopened. We took the elevator down 750 feet (!) to the Big Room. The atmosphere was a bit close but bearable. And the cavern! Stunning, just stunning. We'd been warned to keep our voices down as sound can travel, so I was bit annoyed to hear a couple of loud women coming my way, laughing and joking and not at all respectful of other visitors. Then they passed me, I'm sorry to say I was pretty rude to them, but it had the desired effect and I didn't hear them again. The artificial lighting is really good and helps to display (?) some of the features in the caverns. I had no idea there were so many types of formations, and some of them were quite alien-looking.

If you have more time, I believe natural entrance would yield some interesting sights, as well.Park Service has done a remarkable job maintaining the cavern, with balancing easy access to sights within cavern, while avoiding making the place overly touristic.They have done a good job maintaining the natural state of cavern while creating easily walk able pathways.Be sure to not forego the 9.8 mile loop road through the desert, with entrance near the cavern.","May 14, 2012",Amazing wonder,37,,4

A lovely experience as we could take as long as we liked without feeling that we were holding the rest of the party back. Wonderful easy slopes down 850 feet and then thankfully a lift back up. Really modern restrooms and refreshment facilities at the bottom, which was rather out of character with the initial instructions to respect the bat and cave environment.. Do wash your hands well in the flash restroom though, as there are lots of bat droppings on the handrails.","May 9, 2012",easy self guided tour,29,"London, United Kingdom",4

Big Room,"I can't begin to describe the cave formations. They are so impressive, and there's another amazing view everywhere you turn. We made four trips to the Big Room while we were at Carlsbad and were awestruck every time. If you are on a tight schedule, take the shortcut (not wheelchair accessible). You'll still see all the major formations. Stop at the restrooms before you start out. It's a long way around. The formations are beautifully lit, but we also used a flashlight. There were some great things sitting out there in dark corners. Look up, look down- there are cave decorations everywhere. While we were there, the main elevators were being renovated and there were lines to get up and down. If you're planning a trip in 2012, check to see if they're still down- if so, allow extra time to get in and out. April was a great time to visit. The weather was fairly cool and the caves weren't crowded.","April 28, 2012",Awesome,37,"Plattsmouth, Nebraska",5

We so much enjoyed the whole experience and were awestruck by the scenic wonders of the cavern decorations. The staff was knowledgable and helpful. Take your time and enjoy he experience. Let the busy tourists pass you by and enjoy the amazing sights. My personal feeling is that it was on a par with the amazement I felt when I first visited the Grand Canyon. Also, the book I bought telling of Jim White's discovery and dedication to the Caverns in his own words was worth a lot more than the $6.95 I paid for it.","April 23, 2012",Awesome,2,"Truth or Consequences, NM",5

My only complaint are those who don't keep their kids under control and let them scream, yell and run rampant in the caves. I have kids of my own and know that kids will be kids but the guides ask us to talk no louder than a whisper and the walk ways are very dark, narrow and can be slippery.That said, I recommend bringing the whole family.

Well worth the side trip.In fact if you are going between New Mexico and Texas, this isn't much of a side trip since the highway to the Caverns connects on to San Antonio.There is a natural entrance that connects to the Big Room and if we had the time we would have taken it. Best to get there earlier in the day.You can buy food at the site which is not that clear on their web site.

The lighting is wonderful and it's being changed out to LED so you can really see the difference in spots where it has been changed out. People were very quiet, whispering, so that you get the amazing feeling of being in a fantastic cathedral. IT is sooooo huge that you don't get that claustrophobic feeling like in smaller caves. If you have the time try to experience one of the ranger led tours, they take you to other parts of the cave that you would not see otherwise and the rangers have so much knowledge about the cave.

It will take a couple of hours to walk around but you'll leave knowing you,ve missed half of what's there. You can enter through the historical entrance or by elevator.

The trail takes you through the Big Room, which winds it way through the mountain. The trail is numbered, if you have rented the listening devices, and also marked with descriptive signage. All sorts of formations are here, but the overwhelming feeling we got was of the cave's size. Having visited other caves around the country, nothing compares to this huge space.

I was a disappointed to only have the time to see the one room and thought that the big room would be so-so because it was the common cave that anyone and their grandmother (literally) could explore.

Big Room,"You just have to see it. It is incredible. We drove for 10 hours from Houston to come to Carlsbad Caverns and it was definitely worth it. The Big Room it is one of the largest caverns chambers in the world. It is enormous. You can easily fly a helicopter in there if you wish. Wikipedia says: ""4,000 feet (about 1,219 m) long, 625 feet (190.5 m) wide, and 350 feet (about 107 m) high at the highest point.""Do not be fooled by the photographs you see online. It is hard to capture the enormous size of this room in a photo without having some reference points. I saw pictures before visiting it but the real thing was still astonishing.Unless you are a good photographer or have very good gear, you will find it challenging to take shots. Flash photography in the cave is not such a good idea.Keep in mind that New Mexico (and therefore the Caverns) are using Mountain Time.You need to plan for this if you are arriving from Texas.

We visited on a road trip across the American Southwest, visiting many major sights (Grand Canyon, Painted Desert, etc.) We agreed that the Big Room at Carlsbad Caverns was our favorite part of the whole trip.There were so many different and wonderful formations to see. Flash photography is allowed, but I left my flash off, preferring the lighting supplied by the site. If you're going to do the same, make sure you bring a tripod, at least (also a remote shutter--optional.)We went May 10th on a Tuesday afternoon and there were few people and virtually no waiting.For a few extra bucks you can take a free audio tour, but we were content just to wander in silence. From time to time we'd encounter park employees, who were always pleasant and kind, using their flashlights to reveal additional, smaller formations we would've missed otherwise.The vast scope of the Big Room was difficult for my brain to comprehend. There's also a bit of a disorienting feeling because you're underground, of course. I was so amazed at the sights that I didn't notice until we came back out that my feet were absolutely killing me (but we'd already hiked 2 miles before visiting the Caverns--if you're JUST doing the Big Room, you should have no problem.)Although I'd brought a sweater, I didn't need it.I would visit this attraction again and I recommend that anyone who's able GO THERE!

The Lower Cave Tour was my favorite, and I also did the Left Hand Tunnel tour and Slaughter Canyon Cave tour.

Except for some younger people that seemed intent to get through there and on to something else everyone just soaked the place up.

This is the only part of the caverns that is included in the park entrance fee, the others can only be viewed on guided tours at additional cost. We chose to hike down through the natural entrance, and that is pretty dramatic, descending via switchbacks into the huge cave with the cave swallows darting around. Then it's a long downhill slog through dark corridors with the occasional underwhelming formation to look at. Then you're finally in the Big Room, largest underground room in the Western Hemisphere apparently. I say apparently because you never get a view of the whole cavern, just a series of small views as you wend your way around. There are some formations to be seen, but frankly I've seen much more impressive caves in Europe, this one has too much rock and too little calcite.","May 15, 2011",A bit of a disappointment,284,"London, United Kingdom",3
Big Room,"For your reference, the two main and biggest elevators are DOWN ALL SUMMER for repair/maintenance. That means a giant queue both going up and especially down. You are best of walking down the main walking entrance (better views anyway). Also, this cave gets VERY BUSY during the summer months (basically starting Memorial Day Weekend through September 1st). You are MUCH better off visiting during mid-week and being there during not peak hours. If you can, plan your visit during OFF-PEAK season, which is mid-September through November until Thanksgiving. Weather is still great, bats are still there, and it is basically empty of people.The bats at night are definitely worth seeing/experiencing. Before the bats the cave swallows come and go, which is also awesome. Photos/videos are not allowed during the bat flight. The cave system itself is so much bigger and better than any photos could ever show. Photos simply cannot do it justice. It must be experienced first hand.

The cave is not tacky/touristy at all, even though they have bathrooms and a snack bar in the cave at the entrance to the Big Room.Rent the audio guide (for $3.00 a person). It had a lot of information that wasn't on the signs along the path.NOTE: They are repairing elevators this year. There are still two freight elevators in use when you exit the cave.

I would highly recommend the self guided audio wands that you can rent at the bookstore. As you take your tour you pass signs with numbers on them, you punch these numbers into the audio wand and a ranger tells you about what you are looking at. My kids 9-12 liked using one also.We also took the natural entrance tour, which is my second recommended tour and you can also use your audio wand on. At the end of our day we took the King's Palace tour, which is good for 8+ years and a good chance to ask rangers questions and hear about the history of the cave.","March 22, 2011","Great Tour, top choice, beautiful!

But beware that it is steep in some areas, pitch dark in others and quite lengthy. The Big Room is loaded with natural features. In addition, the park tries to keep it quiet so that you can really experience the cave. However, they should really limit flash photography to a specific area.

I was in there for over two hours and loved every second of it. I can't describe the great feeling of being in a cave without of huge group of people and a tour guide going on and on. There will be times when you're alone on the path, just you and the cave. A great place!My only advice is this. I usually wear a jacket in caves; I did not need one in this. A flashlight would have been nice, so you may want to bring your own. Also check your camera and see if there's a low light setting you can use. That may help a little, but, even with that, most of the pictures probably won't turn out. Also there's sandwiches, water, and restrooms in the cave near the elevators, so don't worry about that.","July 1, 2010",Best Cave Ever!,76,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Big Room,"My third trip. Went in the sixties, late seventies, and now.The ranger led activities are wonderful. We took a ranger led tour, saw the bat flight, and went to a twilight hike, and star party.Fun for everyone, and the landscaping, the grounds, the visitor, and the restaurant were flawless.Fun for all.","June 14, 2010",Carlsbad Caverns: Better than ever,138,"Lubbock, TX",5
Big Room,"I spent over two hours walking through the Big Room and it was an amazing experience! Everywhere I turned my head - left, right, up, down - there was something beautiful to see.The elevators open at 8:30 AM and I was one of the first persons down. I went on my own with the audio guide. I am a slow walker with bad feet but was never in discomfort - the path is quite easy to walk, with only a couple of short, steep inclines. But I stopped so frequently to take pictures or just gaze at the sites that I was never tired. Sadly only a few of the piuctures turned out - the trail and features are well-lit but you're setill in a cave!THE highlight of my trip! A must see if you are anywhere near southern New Mexico.","June 5, 2010",My Neck Hurts,4,Drumheller,5
Big Room,I really enjoyed the Big Room. It is truly amazing on how 'Big' it really is and the formations are fantastic.It was also nice to go at my own pace instead of with a group...,"November 14, 2009",Wow! Pretty cool...,48,"Bellingham, Washington",5
Big Room,"I went on the self guided tour with my family to the big room. It takes a few minutes for your eye's to adjust to the darkness but after they do you can see some of the most beautiful cave formations ever. The pathway is about a mile and should take one and a half hours to finish, but it took me around two hours. The vastness of the cave and the size of the stalagmites and stalactites kept me glued to my camera trying to get pictures of everything. It's a good idea to bring a tripod if you want any real good pictures due to the low light in the caves. If you’re in to cave diving this can not be missed. I wish that I had gone on a guided tour to some of the harder to reach areas but I didn't have enough time.","May 28, 2009",Amazing,18,"Naha, Japan",5
