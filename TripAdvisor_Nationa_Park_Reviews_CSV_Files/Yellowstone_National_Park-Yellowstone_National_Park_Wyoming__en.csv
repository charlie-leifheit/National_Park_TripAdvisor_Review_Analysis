Yellowstone National Park,"A visit to Yellowstone is beyond amazing, it is simply beautiful and it is a feeling that will stay with you forever. We will be back","October 18, 2019",Breathtaking!,116,,5
Yellowstone National Park,"Wildlife, geysers, waterfalls & mountains covered with snow. So many things to see and do. We saw a coyote hunting for food which was a great interest to several people. Where we are from we see coyotes all of the time so we drove on by.","October 16, 2019",Waterfalls,0,,5
Yellowstone National Park,"If you want to visit Yellowstone NP, you should evaluate carefully the period when you want to visit: I'm sure in summer it's overcrowded with tourists, so I decided to visit in early October - I managed to visit only about half of it only. Yellowstone NP is huge, I drove about 90 miles within the park to visit some of the areas (Madison River, Artists Paintpots, Norris Geyser Basin, Canyon Village, Yellowstone River, Mud Volcano, Lake Village). All these areas were very beautiful, with some outstanding views, even if I had no luck in spotting wildlife such as bisons.About mid-afternoon it started snowing, so I decided to exit the park and visit the rest the following day. It took me 3 hours 30 minutes to drive from Lake Village to Jackson (a little less than 100 miles).The following day I did not re-enter Yellowstone NP - it was cloudy in Jackson, but snowing in Yellowstone, and I did not want to risk 3.5 + 3.5 hors of driving!Make sure to check weather forecasts a couple of days before visiting Yellowstone!","October 16, 2019",Yellowstone NP,124,"Milan, Italy",4
Yellowstone National Park,"This is an interesting place and if you're lucky you can see a lot of wild life. When we visited in Oct 19, we saw plenty of bison and deer but only 2 bears and 1 Elk still it was fantastic to have got the experience to enjoy this NP","October 15, 2019",Interesting,0,"Lisburn, United Kingdom",4
Yellowstone National Park,"and well worth the effort it took to get there; there are so many facets to this park and so amazing in all areas, it would be pleasing to anyone who visited. I wasn't up for a lot of hiking which there is a ton of but still we enjoyed every spectacular bit","October 15, 2019",it was on our bucket list,26,"Walkertown, North Carolina",5

Yellowstone National Park,"We took a trip out west and spent 2 days/nights at Yellowstone. Old Faithful did not disappoint! It is such an amazing spectacle. Also all of the other features of the park just must be seen. I would stay at Old Faithful Inn or Cabins in that area because it is near the most famous geyser and also I think the best, most central location to see both loops. We used GyPSy Guide GPS system through our phones for our tour guide and I know we saw more than bus tours. I recommend that you pull off at every opportunity because there is something unique about every vista. We could not believe how much Geo thermal activity is there. And for goodness sakes- hang on to your pets and children as it is as dangerous as it is beautiful here. Follow all the rules and stay on the walkways. Go early am or at dusk to see the most animals. ","October 14, 2019",Amazing of course,55,"Houghton Lake, Michigan",5
Yellowstone National Park,"I Visited here from the UK as I wanted to see the ruggedness of the land and the wild life. I had completed a road trip through the Rockies 3 years ago and thought that was really good, but it was nothing compared to this.rugged landscapes, wildlife, it really is a see it to believe it..","October 14, 2019","Wonderful views, excellent experience",15,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",5
Yellowstone National Park,Spent three days in Yellowstone National Forest we entered in through the North Gate. Very beautiful place some breathtaking sights stuff that you'll never see anywhere else. The gaiser basin was very cool to see all the geysers that are active in the park. The third day we took a trip more around the flat land area and seen tons of Buffalo very beautiful animals they roam free so you have to be careful. As a family trip with me and my two teenage kids we were very pleased and loved the outdoors I would recommend anyone go to Yellowstone it will be a trip like no other,"October 13, 2019",Yellowstone,7,"Dallas, Texas",5
Yellowstone National Park,Despite the title of my review I did greatly enjoy the experience but it was slightly let down by the vast amount of road works taking place especially around the Fishing Bridge area which took away one hour from my sightseeing plans. It is a great spectacle with many photo opportunities that can add a considerable amount of time to your plans along with the traffic delays when an animal appears in shot and however much time you allot to spending in the park it can never really be enough. I was disappointed to have to pay to lots of 35 dollars to drive through Grand Teton & Yellowstone especially as I am a solo traveller but I know that Americans love their national parks so do not have a problem contributing to their upkeep. I am not sure I will ever make the trip again from the UK but I am glad I have experienced it though I still maintain that it did not have the Wow factor that I was perhaps wrongly expecting.,"October 13, 2019",Not as good as I expected,47,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",4
Yellowstone National Park,"We enjoyed our early October visit to the park. Crowds are definitely smaller, but you risk having plans interrupted due to roads closing when it snows. We were blessed to have everything work out, but snow was an issue several days. I'd recommend going in early September rather than October. I've also visited in the summer and the crowds are a problem.","October 13, 2019","Great fall trip, but need to be aware roads can be closed due to weather",5,"Key West, Florida",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone can not be done justice with words, pictures and/or videos. You MUST! go see it for yourself. There be will be plenty of loving it and absolutely, whatsoever NO! regret! Be prepared to drive into/out of the park for about 45 minutes each day after nightfall unless you literally have a thousand/more to spend on lodging for several nights. I'm not joking on this room expense.","October 11, 2019","Nature on display: waterfalls, wildlife, steam from the ground, geysers amd more",7,"Lincoln, Nebraska",5
Yellowstone National Park,We drove up early from Jackson and was able to see so much in just day. The geysers were great - highly recommend seeing castle geyser. We then headed to see Grand Prismatic. We actually parked at Fairy Falls and walked an easy trail to the overlook to get great views. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is also a must - such amazing views. We checked it out from both sides. Saw a lot of wildlife when driving from one stop to the next.,"October 11, 2019",Yellowstone Lower Loop in a day,6,"Park Ridge, Illinois",5
Yellowstone National Park,"I think firstly you need to stay in the park so you don't have the driving in or out everyday on top of the driving within the park. It doesn't really matter where you stay in the park but it is obviously busier if you stay around Old Faithful. Don't let that put you off especially if you go before/after summer. We stayed in September and although there were people around, you weren't pushing and shoving at all and not crowded on the elevated boardwalks. Yellowstone is a beautiful place and I think seeing the animals makes it. Even if you don't want to drive the whole park, I think you'd still need at least 2-3 days to enjoy the main attractions.","October 10, 2019",Beautiful,188,"Sydney, Australia",5

Yellowstone National Park,"The grandeur of Yellowstone was somehow lost on me. We drove the ""Grand Loop"" on Oct 1, 2019, entering the southern park entrance at about 8:30am. We exited the same gate at about 3 pm. We stopped at Old Faithful, Grand Prismatic Springs, Artists Pots, and one other famous attaction, and stopped to view/photo wildlife at least 5 X. We spent the most time at Old Faithful and enjoyed walking around on the elevated board walk seeing the other smaller geysers and thermal springs more than actually seeing the big guy errupt, which we saw twice. Parking was ample but there were several tour buses of Chinese tourists who made up quite a crowd. Every other place we stopped (other than on side of the road to see bison) the parking lots were full or nearly full and the walkways crowded. I can only imagine how utterly frustrated I would have been having to see it during the peak season with its crowds. I guess the biggest disappointment was that the park just wasnt that impressive from a mountain/scenery perspective. Topography was much more rolling plains, or dense pine forest you couldn't see thru from the road. Grand Teton Nat'l Park was SO MUCH more impressive! I would advise people that didnt have time to spend at least a whole day or two in EACH park (Yellowston + Grand Teton), skip Yellowstone and spend your time in the uncrowded, much more beautiful Grand Teton park, where you will see a much greater variety of wildlife, impressive mountains, and trails to fit any desire.","October 8, 2019",Crowded even in off-season,31,"Houston, Texas",3
Yellowstone National Park,"If you have never visited Yellowstone, you owe it to yourself to make the trip. You will see natural wonders like you have never seen anywhere in the world. It is easy to spend several days in the park taking time to stop and see the wonders. There are great places to stay and eat if you wish to stay in the park. Lots of places to stop and have your lunch if you take your own. We visited in September and again in early October. Spring and fall are good times to visit since the crowds are gone. Be sure and check to make sure roads are open. Fall is very beautiful. There is so much beauty to see in and around the Yellowstone Ecosystem and your vacation will refresh and relax you. Be prepared for cooler weather than most of the country.","October 8, 2019",A Real Treat For Your Senses,15,"Welkom, South Africa",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Our visit to Yellowstone was phenomenal. We stayed at the KOA west of the Park, which was a bit longer drive in than we anticipated.I recommend downloading the app, which gives you eruption times, maps and other helpful info. Day 1, we saw Old Faithful, paint pots and other features in that part of the Park. The Junior Ranger program had a fee but was very interesting and informative. My 9 year old could tell us the temperatures of the hydrolic features and calculated he next eruption of Old Faithful.Day 2, we took a morning hike, in an attempt to see animals but only saw a bald eagle, an elk, and several bison. We also saw Mammoth Geyser and drove around the center of the Park.Day 3, we decided we would get up at 5 to see animals. We were not disappointed! On the way through the Park, a mountain liin crossed our path. Up in a hill, people with spotting scopes helped us see wolves and their cubs. Nearby was a cinnamon bear. Father down the road, we saw yet another bear! And of course we saw hundreds of bison!","October 8, 2019",Best of all National Parks!,0,"Williamsburg,",5
Yellowstone National Park,Went to Yellowstone last week of September- there was a bit of snow and icy roads at night from a massive storm in northern Rockies but that did not deter us from marveling at the wonderful scenery in the park. The mountains from the east entrance were amazing- beautiful and majestic by themselves but accented by beautiful surroundings. The southern loop revealed interesting geysers including Old Faithful. The Inn at the geyser is magnificent- should go there just to see the decor. Didn’t see that much wildlife except for a moose and a couple of herds of bison but the experience of being in one of our nation’s natural wonders was clearly worthwhile.,"October 8, 2019","Majestic mountains,geysers, and beautiful animals",9,Westfield,5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone was on our bucket list for years so we were excited to finally be there. Nothing I write here will ever do it justice. The Park is beyond amazing!We passed through Grand Teton and entered at the South Entrance, going immediately to Old Faithful. Our guide had checked the time schedule and we had just enough time to walk down to the benches, find seats, and watch the eruption. We were instructed to grab a lunch at the facility above so we got sandwiches, sat at a window and were fortunate to see the next eruption.The Park is large and one could easily spend a few days here. Our next stops were the Upper, Midway and Lower Geyser Basins. An interesting place was at the Lower Basin where there was an eerie scene of dead bare tree trunks sitting in a white muddy area, the bottoms of the trunks being white. Great stark photo op!This is also the starting point for a half-mile boardwalk called Fountain Paint Pots Trail. Here you will see mudpots, hot springs and fumeroles, and possibly one or more of the geysers erupting. It is one of the most dynamic hydrothermal areas in the Park.Another favorite stop was Artist Point at the Lower Falls (over near Canyon Village). They refer to this as the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The canyon colors are beautiful and cameras were clicking, but walk down a way until you get to the stairway. From that corner there is a great view of the waterfalls spilling down into the Yellowstone River. How fortunate we are to have this amazing, beautiful Park. Enjoy!!","October 7, 2019",Magnificent Treasure,286,"Springfield, Massachusetts",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Went on a wildlife safari, did north and south loop taking in all the sights such as Old Faithful, Grand Prismatic Spring, Norris Geyser Basin, Lamar and Hayden Valley. So much to see and do and while we spend 4 days in the park, there is so much more to do like all the day hikes, Bechler region etc. which we didn't have time to explore. A really amazing adventure!","October 6, 2019","Wildlife, geysers, hot springs and endless views",58,"Seattle, Washington",5
Yellowstone National Park,We visited Yellowstone the first week of October and it was fantastic. The temperature was cool and there was a dusting of snow but there were also no crowds. We stayed at the Lake Hotel which was very comfortable and the lobby had the feel of a very grand hotel. In the mornings we enjoyed watching the wild life and the sunrise over the lake from the lobby. Yellowstone is one place I would recommend everyone to visit.,"October 6, 2019",Amazing,5,"Denver, Colorado",5
Yellowstone National Park,We arrived in our motorhome from the Southeast entrance and drove through part of Teton into Yellowstone and made our way through the park to West Yellowstone MT. We visited the park for three days in a car and had a most unique and wonderful experience - where else can you drive on an active supervolcano?

Yellowstone National Park,"My friend and I came in the east entrance and explored around the upper half of the park as we had two nights in West Yellowstone. We did the southern route the next day. A very pretty park with a bit of wildlife that we saw. Was still pretty crowded for late August and some places you couldn't even get a place to park. But, what we were able to stop and see was really nice! Well worth seeing!! Was my first visit.","October 3, 2019",Very beautiful!!,189,"Fort Mohave, Arizona",5
Yellowstone National Park,This was a first time for me and won't be the last time. EXPANSIVE park. So much to see. Make at least a day for each section of the park that you want to see. Be prepared for some hiking and elevation challenges. Pictures don't do it justice. Main roads are plenty wide for large campers etc. Just be sensible when driving and pay attention to signs that recommend size of vehicles. Don't be a dumb butt and ignore the signs. Not only will you ruin your day but others as well. ,"October 3, 2019",A MUST DO!,57,"Urbana, Ohio, United States",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone National Park should be a bucket list trip for anyone who loves nature, amazing landscape and wildlife. We spent two day there (could have spent more time) and saw hundreds of bison, many elk, Old Faithful, the mud pots, waterfalls and more.

Yellowstone National Park,"We recently came back from an amazing trip in September of Yellowstone and Grand Tetons. I had read a TON of reviews before going and a couple people mentioned that the GyPSy guide (app you download on your phone for about $10) made their trip. I was so glad we read the reviews, and downloaded the app. There is no basically phone service in Yellowstone or Grand Teton's, so using a GPS to get you from place to place in the park won’t work. Somehow this app worked. It knew exactly where we were at all times. It was amazing. We named it ""Ted"" and soon did not want to dive anywhere without it. The GyPSy Guide would tell you that a stop was coming up and whether it was worth exploring, or if there was a better look out a little later. The app shared history about the parks and animals. It really took the stress out of navigating (especially since you'd be only using a paper map otherwise). Well worth the investment! It worked for both parks (Yellowstone and Grand Tetons).There is so much to do in the park, whether it is a waterfall to check out or volcano feature, or a pull off with a beautiful view. For planners, like myself, it can be overwhelming if you are trying to figure out how to navigate the park, and how much time it will take to complete activities on your own. The app made it easy. It would explain how long stops would take, etc. Most of the main attractions are right off the road, so you do not need to ""hike"" unless you are looking to do that. We flew in and out of Jackson Hole, WY (the airport is in Grand Teton National Park). We stayed our first night at the Elk Country Inn about 20 minutes away from the airport in Jackson Hole (town). The town was cute and worth a night to check out. I'd recommend eating at Liberty Burger, while in Jackson Hole. I'd brought a backpack cooler, packed in my suitcase. We stopped off at a grocery store (Albertson's) in Jackson Hole (there is also a liquor store in the same shopping center) and picked up bagels and sandwiches. So we'd have breakfast and lunch covered while in Yellowstone. We reserved a minivan, which was helpful so each of our 4 adults would have bucket seats and we had plenty of room for luggage. This trip is a LOT of driving with frequent stops (stopping about every 15-30 minutes). There is a lot to see in the parks. A comfortable ride is important. We drove the next day through the Grand Teton's to Yellowstone (which is about 1.5 hours north of Jackson Hole). Yellowstone Park is in the shape of the number 8. It costs about $80 for a week's access to both parks. We had our best weather on the first two days, so we arranged our visit based on the weather. We visited the Old Faithful area (bottom left of the 8) first when we entered the park from the south. We had a full day of sightseeing exploring that side of the park, and stayed that night (and the next two nights - total of 3 nights) in Canyon Lodge. Canyon Lodge is in a great location (middle of the figure 8), however it does not have a TV, microwave, AC, or internet, and rooms are expensive and the food in the restaurants there was pretty terrible. Some people opt to say outside the park in West Yellowstone to have these amenities and less cost, but the traffic to get in to Yellowstone in the morning, and out of Yellowstone in the evening is SIGNIFICANT. The 2nd day, since we still had good weather, we headed north, starting from Canyon Lodge (middle of the figure 8) and stayed on the right side. During this day, we explored Hayden Valley (saw buffalo, grizzly bears, black bears), exited the park to Gardiner, Montana and took pictures next to the Roosevelt Arch. Then we headed back into Yellowstone and explored the features in the Mammoth area (north part of the 8) (there are frequent Elk in town), and then headed south on the west side back to the middle of the figure 8 back to Canyon Lodge. We completed the full top circle of the 8 in one day. It was action packed. The 3rd day it rained. :( We were not interested in exploring the park in the rain, so we headed out of the park to West Yellowstone. It is about an hour drive from Canyon to the town of West Yellowstone. Our plan was to watch a movie and have a good meal. The movie theater only had 3 movies playing and was sold out. (Buy tickets early if it's raining.) We ate at Wild West Pizzeria which was REALLY good. We drove about a half hour west to a park in Idaho. We figured we'd check Idaho off the state list, since we may never visit there otherwise.On the next day we checked out of Canyon Lodge. There were a couple of things to see right near Canyon Lodge (Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, etc) which we did, then made our way south. We ate lunch at Lake Yellowstone (which is a beautiful hotel and lunch was great, but expensive) then completed the final bottom right portion of the figure 8, and continued South and explored the east (right) side of the Grand Tetons Park (Grand Tetons park is kind of in an oval shape). That night, and for the next 2 additional nights (3 nights total) we stayed in an Airbnb in Wilson. Wilson is about 15 minutes south of the Grand Tetons. It was nice to have space, a full kitchen, living room, bedrooms, laundry, etc. The next day we packed our picnic lunch and drove about 40 minutes north to Jenny Lake in the Grand Tetons. We took a boat ride across the lake ($10 pp), then hiked to the waterfalls and to Inspiration Point. Inspiration Point is where we had our picnic and saw the amazing view of the lake on one side and the Grand Tetons Mountains on the other. It was REALLY nice! The pictures were amazing. Then we hiked back to the car. The hike back to the van was a bit strenuous, with more hills than I had expected. We also drove a short distance north to the Jackson Lake Lodge. You can have drinks on the back deck of the hotel. The view was really nice. (This is NOT a great view for a sunset though). The next day we explored the Laurance Rockeffeller Preserve and Phelps Lake which were about 15 minutes north of Wilson (off Moose Wilson Road). It was a fairly strenuous hike to the lake, but also beautiful. You can do a loop, so you don't have to repeat your steps. It took us about 2.5 hours. In Wilson, we found another great pizza place, called Calico. It was really busy, you may want to order to go. It was a great trip. We saw a lot of animals. Amazing time! Hope you have a great trip.","September 30, 2019",GyPSy Guide - Made our Yellowstone/Grand Teton Trip,21,"Lake Ridge, Virginia",5
Yellowstone National Park,"this is the first time we were here, after many years of hearing how wonderful it is etc. We flew in to Bozeman airport and rent a car, because of restriction of time. Our experience was much better than what we heard from friends,partly was because we were lucky, had wonderful weather during our 5 days stay. we saw all the attractions and a lot of wild animals, even lucky enough, we spotted a Grizzly bear, and took wonderful picture of it. we down loaded GypSy Guide, as suggested by a friend. It is wonderful app, easy to use, and very informative. This is the first time we went to Yellow stone. without out GypSy Guide, I am sure our trip would much less enjoyable. We will definitely come back someday.","September 29, 2019",it is amazing,1,,5

Loved it!","September 29, 2019",Gorgeous Yellowstone National Park!!!,1,,5
Yellowstone National Park,"This is one of my favorite national parks, I've been here 3 times. There is history, wildlife, and amazing scenery here. Don't try to see the park in 1 or 2 days. To see it properly takes at least 5 days because there is so much to see and do. The park is broken into sections - Lake, Old Faithful, Madison/Norris, Mammoth, Tower/Roosevelt, and Canyon. I recommend spending 1 day at each area and exploring. To avoid the crowds go early in the day or later in the day. If you spot wildlife, be considerate and pull completely off the road. We were stuck in so many bear and bison jams and people would just stop in the middle of the road (sometimes bison would be in the road so cars couldn't move). They would also get too close to the bears and spoil it for anyone else trying to get a glimpse. Lodging inside the park can be costly (cost us about $2000 for 6 nights at Canyon Lodge) but is convenient for exploring. Take a drive out to the Lamar Valley and watch for grizzly bears, bison, elk and pronghorn. Ask people stopped along the way what they are looking at/for. Many times you can see wildlife you wouldn't normally spot. We saw a grizzly sow with cubs several times. At the end of Lamar Valley, near the northwest entrance, we saw a black bear eating a moose carcass.Do get out and explore the more popular parts of the park but take time to check out the hidden gems - Duck Lake, Yellowstone Lake Overlook, Clearwater Springs, Frying Pan Spring, Nymph Lake, Beryl Spring, Terrace Spring.Be prepared for any kind of weather. We enjoyed mostly warm days but our last night in the park, it started snowing. We woke the next morning to about 5 inches of snow (June 8, 2019). Most ways out of the park were closed. The West Entrance and Mammoth (I think) were the only ways out.I definitely recommend a visit to this great national park.","September 28, 2019",Amazing,215,"Kellyville, Oklahoma",5

Yellowstone National Park,"When it comes to looking for wildlife in Yellowstone’s Lamar Valley there are no guarantees. The first time I tried I had limited success. I stopped my car where other cars and vans had stopped and saw a fair bit of wildlife e.g., buffalos, pronghorn deer, and more. But I was disappointed at what I had not seen e.g., bear, wolves, etc. So, on my next visit to the park, and after a thorough review of Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews, my wife and I commissioned Yellowstone Guidelines for a private tour. Oh, what a difference it made! They had the right equipment (spotting scopes and radio transmitters) and experienced staff necessary to maximize the potential for seeing wildlife. Our guide, Cayley, not only knew where to look for the animals but she also knew all about the wildlife. We saw, and heard all about, deer, bull elk, grizzlies (including one guarding a kill and a mother and cub), a black bear, a red fox, 8-9 wolves (grey and black) trying to get their kill back from the first grizzly, pronghorn deer, a badger, a huge herd of buffalo, and mountain goats. Cayley not only knew about the animals; she also knew a lot about the plants and geology of the region. Our private tour also included snacks and a wonderful lunch. I would highly recommend Yellowstone Guidelines for your tour of the Lamar Valley.","September 25, 2019",Lamar Valley Wildlife Tour,0,,5

God knows when it will erupt again because it is an active volcanic site where subterranean heat of magma is being continuously transferred to the surface and vented thru a huge numbers of geysers, fumaroles, hot springs and mudpots.About 631 thousand years ago there was a huge volcanic eruption here creating a giant caldera of 30 by 45 mile in dimension. The park has a rich ecosystems ranging from arid vegetation, which you'll find at the north entrance to sub-alpine meadow and forest Mount Washburn. They support a variety of habitats where thrive diverse wildlife like bison, elk deer, grizzly and black bears, pronghorn deer, gray wolves, Canadian goose, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Not only wildlife, many native American tribes still have a deep-rooted connections here. You will wonder as you will explore them.Animals are seldom seen in the dense, dark forest that covers most part of the park, Rather they are more easily seen in open meadows, shallow pools & rivers where you'll get ample opportunities to watch and photograph them. There are several adventure packages and expeditions available e.g. you may go for Winter Wolf Discovery package. In winter, very interesting are snow coaches ploughing through a feet deep snow with their oversize tires (4 ft tall and 3 ft wide).The Park is divided into three loops with wide, asphalt paths, so that you can drive and reach upto the walking distance of all major geothermal activities.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is a national park that cannot possibly be covered in one, two or even three days. My wife and I made our second trip to YNP, spending 4 1/2 days and still left some areas unseen or unhiked. Please, if you plan to visit Yellowstone, allow a minimum of 4 days, preferably a week. It takes at least a couple days to see all the sites at the Old Faithful area, alone. It can't be stated emphatically enough about how much wonder mother nature provides in this park in the way of geysers, thermal activity, water falls, hiking, wildlife, forests and scenic drives.The only major downside is that the park is so loved that traffic is often unbearably slow and backed up at certain times of the day. Often, tourist drivers stop in the middle of the road to view/photograph bison, elk or the rare bear completing ignoring driver sensibility that they pull to the side of road and allow traffic to flow past them. Please be a good tourist and obey speed limits, pull to the side of the road when viewing wildlife and park in responsible parking areas. Always plan for delays and be patient in your travel plans because you can't control the traffic and multiple personalities that visit Yellowstone (example: traffic back up for miles due to a couple of women walking in the middle of the road photographing the landscape, completely oblivious to the traffic backup and potential for personal harm that they caused).Yellowstone is a wonderful treasure but increasing traffic and tourist irresponsibility make it quite a challenge to enjoy.","September 18, 2019",Worthy of First National park status,34,Bowling Green,5

This park has so many visitors even in the shoulder months, so please prepare to show patience and courtesy to make your trip the wonderful visit it can be. All the sites, drives and walks are worth the visit--but you will run into the lack of parking at these spots so you might have to come back a second time to get the opportunity to see them. Noris Basin is one of these sites. The best place to see the buffalo herds is on the northeast entrance road. The elk hang out around the north park entrance in Gardiner and at Mammoth Springs. The speed limit is 45 MPH but driving slowly lets you enjoy the wonderful vistas and the wildlife that pops up unexpectedly. There are special drives that do NOT allow access by buses, RVS, campers so please be aware of that as you do your planning. Food and bathroom breaks can present a challenge, too. Only at the major lodges do you find true bathrooms.Take your sandwiches and drinks as the lines can be long and you don't want to waste time waiting.

We saw elk in Mammoth, pronghorns in Lamar Valley and bison the valleys, at Old Faithful, and Lake. The Rangers were helpful and informative.

Yellowstone National Park,"Went to Yellowstone in September with my family for our first trip. The overall experience was positive, but there are some cautions for visitors. First, the sight are amazing - the geysers, the landscape and the animals. However, Yellowstone is HUGE, very spartan accommodations and can be quite dangerous. The park is massive and you need to allow a lot of time driving around. The roads are good, but there a lot of foreign visitors, poor drivers, on single lane roads. Most of the sights are not close to each other. The driving can also be very dangerous. We drove through the park to Lamar Valley and also out the East entrance. It was treacherous driving up and down winding mountain roads with steep drop offs a foot off the road with no guardrail in many areas. I would never drive at night or in any kind of bad weather. The other caution is about the accommodations. We stayed at the best and newest lodges in the park according to many - the snow lodge and canyons lodge. The accommodations were very basic - no TV, no WiFi, poor or no food options. Overall very limited and very expensive. You are paying for the location. We thought the lodging was 2 stars at a 5 star price. ","September 13, 2019",Epic but Beware,6,"Northville, Michigan",4

We also have a child in a wheelchair so we stuck to the areas that have boardwalks or paved walkways and drove ourselves. We arrived at 7am to beat the crowds and traffic wasn't bad at all. We saw a bear in the road almost immediately after entering the Madison area - it was the highlight of the trip for the kids! Our first stop was the Canyon Village Visitor Center for an animal program (we did make a few photo detours along the way). The ranger gave us lots of great info to start out our trip. As we drove through Hayden Valley we saw a giant herd of Bison and some Elk grazing. The mud volcano area was cool, but a little crowded. We stopped in Fishing Bridge for lunch (bison burger and elk sausage). The food was good and the prices were about what you would expect in a tourist area. West Thumb basin was one of our favorite stops. The boys found a shady spot and took a quick nap in the car while the girls attended a ranger program. Then we met up and strolled the entire area. There was a lot to see, colorful paintpots, beautiful teal springs, and interesting lake cones. Our next stop was Old Faithful. We got lucky and arrived just before it was scheduled to erupt. I was a little underwhelmed. Of all the things we saw, it was probably the least impressive and by far the most crowded. We had some ice cream and took a quick break for souveniers at this stop. The kids showed their ranger books and got their badges here as well. Our last stop was the Grand Prismatic Spring. By this time it was almost 6pm and we were pretty tired, so we almost skipped it. SO GLAD WE DIDN'T. This is a must see. It was absolutely beautiful! On our way out of the park we saw pronghorn drinking from the stream. Overall, our one day sampler itenerary gave us a little taste of everything in the park and was perfect for someone with limited mobility. It was a long day but definitely doable.

The variety of things to do and see in the park vary as much as the landscape and you can find something for everyone. Overall the park has a fair blend of amusement park-like amenities and nature/wilderness. You can certainly find at least a few things you'll enjoy and you don't have to break into wilderness mode to enjoy it. If you really want to see the entire park you will have to give yourself 4 to 5 days to do it in a non-rushed manner.

We ate every meal in the park and the food was pricey but delicious. Bison Burgers and chocolate sundaes every night will make any kid happy.I wish our package included an Inn at Old Faithful. I think it would be fun to go out at night or early in the morning without the big crowds to watch the eruption.We worked on our Jr Ranger badges throughout the trip. The kids earned their badges on the last day. The parents did it with them and it was fun and great learning. Our group of kids were ages 9-12. 6 days in the park was not quite enough but it was a hit.A scope is a must! the more the merrier. Most of the wildlife is best observed from a distance and the kids enjoyed scoping them out and taking pictures through the lens of the scope.I DO NOT recommend the package we took with Yellowstone Forever. The bus was an old small school bus type. The seats were very cramped and uncomfortable. The kids got sick. You could not see out of the windows. There is no storage. You will spend time walking through parking lots with your kids - your guide is your bus driver. We saw the other tours with new buses with large windows and air conditioning. The Tauck tours looked especially good.The park is large and you will spend a significant amount of time on the bus with your driver. Make sure your bus meets the needs for comfort, storage and convenience.

We went in late-August and there were still a lot of people in the park but it was very manageable. I have never been during the peaks times so do your research on when would be the best time of the year to go.Also, don't be one of those tourist that gets to close to a bear, bison, or elk.

Yellowstone National Park,"Took the opportunity to take grandkids (and parents ) camping in the park in mid June while crowds were still minimal for the summer season. Went fishing several times, hiking many more. Saw wildlife everywhere. Bison by the hundreds. No need to go find them, they found us. Fortunate that the calves were in herd mode with the cows. Bison Jams in many places. Weather was cold (daughter-in-law not excited by that). Old faithful still doing well. We saw it go off 4-5 times during an afternoon visit to the geyser basin. The Falls were beautiful and the Canyon gorgeous. Got rained out for horseback riding at Roosevelt but made due with a bear sighting instead (stayed in the car of course). Hot Springs and pools were impressive as always. Plan way ahead when going to Yellowstone. A year or more is sometimes necessary for getting reservations for campsites, riding, restaurants and especially for the hotels; tour groups book up the rooms up to two years ahead and leave very little for families! My biggest and maybe only complaint is that the grocery stores have appallingly little in the way of fresh vegetables and fruit. The outside communities do much better but they are a fair distance to go shopping. Bringing enough for a week is a challenge.","August 24, 2019",Trip of a lifetime,78,"Charlottesville, Virginia",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Everywhere you go in this vast park, you will find National Geographic vistas. The geysers, the lakes, the canyon,and falls, and the wildlife are amazing.","August 23, 2019",No wonder it was made the first National Park,53,"Venice, Florida",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We took a family vacation to Yellowstone in July/August of 2019. Stayed at the Old Faithful Inn. The Inn is right next to the Geyser. Getting reservations to the Inn must be done at least a year in advance via US Park Lodging. Note that the Inn is somewhat rustic (no air conditioning - but don't really need it, no TV, and no WiFi). Unless you just want to stay there, I would recommend looking at the hotel facilities near the Grand Canyon because it is more central to the park. Driving into the park everyday from an external hotel and back at night would make for long days. The park is beautiful, but after a couple days geysers, mud pits, and the colored pools will all start to look alike. Hiking options are excellent. You can find easy, moderate, and difficult paths depending on your desire. Note that there are wildlife everywhere and it is a good idea to hike in packs of 4 or more as well as to carry bear spray. It is against the law to touch bear, elk, bison or any other animal in the park. Also, the maximum speed in the park is 45 MPH. That's why getting to and from locations is good from a central place. You will find bison in Hayden and Lamar valley. They will be on the roads. Be careful, they will damage cars and chase you if you irritate them. Snorting and stomping are key signs. Elk were abundant in the Mammoth Springs and Lake Yellowstone areas. Get to the viewing areas early and then again around 6 PM. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is beautiful. There is an upper and lower falls. Paths on both sides of the canyon. The south side I believe was easier to hike. You can also park right next to the upper falls in a parking lot on the south side. Yellowstone Lake is beautiful too. There are boat tours as well as fishing tours you can take from the marina by the lake. Probably want to go early before winds kick up and make the lake rough. I do recommend taking a trip up to Gardner and going on one of the rafting trips. Bring water shoes, wear shorts, and a shirt to keep you warm. The water is cool and you will get wet. I believe the rapids are class 2 & 3. Not difficult yet a lot of fun. You may want to consider motion sickness options if you have issues with winding turns along two lane roads next to cliffs in certain areas. Two lane roads are typical throughout the park.","August 23, 2019",Back to Nature Trip,37,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is the largest active geyser field in the world home to 60 percent of the world's geysers. This is truly out of this world and should be on everyone’s bucket list. It is incredibly stunning and the serenity of the park is simply amazing. Park entry fee is just $35 per car for 7 days. Yellowstone is captivating not only by the geysers, hot springs and deep-blue hot pools but remarkable natural sites such as Hayden Valley, Lamer Valley, mount Washburn, Yellowstone River, Upper and Lower Falls in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and so much more. The elevation of the park might be higher than one would expect so carry water and take your time to enjoy your surroundings. You need at least 4 to 5 days if you planning to hike some of the amazing trails.Please don’t approach the wildlife. Don’t get out of your car to take picture of a Bison walking by. There are signs and warning posted throughout the park how much distance you should keep from which animal. Respect that for your own safety.","August 22, 2019",Yellowstone National Park is Captivating and Remarkable!!,35,"Fair Lawn, New Jersey",5

Yellowstone National Park,"A 3 week road trip of the USA led us to the amazing Yellowstone National Park. Being young and naive, I didn't prepare for life in the park without technology. First things first - if you're relying on Google Maps or Apple Maps for navigating your way around the park, pull in to any gas station before entering the park, connect to the WiFi and download the maps you require for offline use. This caught me off guard at first - I entered Yellowstone ill-equipped.The first evening was spent in Canyon Village Lodges - hours wasted trying to connect to the <average WiFi. It runs ~0.5mbps and when over a dozen people are trying to connect - you'll find your time would be better spent elsewhere. The subsequent morning, we headed back out of the park via West Yellowstone, found a McDonalds (to leach WiFi) to download offline maps to help us millennials navigate around Yellowstone without a physical map. This was a lifesaver. Additionally, after speaking to a pleasant woman in the lobby at Canyon Village, she recommended that i download and use the Yellowstone and Teton Combo GyPSy Guide. The GyPSy guide is what really made our experience of Yellowstone amazing. We completed all of the National Park in 3 full days, seeing everything there was to be seen (excluding Moose!!). The guide suggests places to pull over to take advantage of the most amazing vantage points of the park, often missed by most. The guide talks to you whilst you make your way around the park, using GPS (it does not require any mobile data, data roaming, WiFi or mobile network) to identify where you are in the park and which direction you are travelling in. Along the route that you drive, the guide will talk to you, inform you of aspects of the park, educate you on the history of the park and the best places to see. Additionally, the frequent reminders of keeping a safe distance from the animals is a nice touch. If you plan on visiting Yellowstone National Park in the future, i highly recommend that you check out this guide. You'll be amazed at how well it works and how much it will enhance your experience of the park.","August 20, 2019",Amazing experience but made 100x better by using Yellowstone and Teton GyPSy Guide,4,,5

Yellowstone National Park,"The park is so big that although we had seven nights spread across three locations we still missed a lot of it. The areas differ so much that you have to be prepared to do a lot of driving. We did and were well rewarded. The geo thermal stuff is great, the lake amazing and the canyons and falls spectacular.

Yellowstone National Park,"Hayden Valley was AMAZING in late July/first of August!! The bison activity was worth it! Bulls were showing off and fighting for the females, females still had calves with them, plenty to photograph/video. Plenty along the road to see up close, from the safety of a vehicle. Old Faithful is a huge area to explore with a ton of parking, whereas most areas of the park are smaller in scale with parking. Norris Geyser Basin is a longer stop with lots to see, tough to find parking. Mammoth Hot Springs had a lot of elk, but wasn’t as interesting to see as we’d hoped (kids aged 8-14 weren’t too impressed by all the walking and not much seeing, and I’d have to agree; seeing it from the parking area for some good photos might’ve been enough actually). Didn’t care for the drive from there to the pass for the Yellowstone Grand Canyon. There was some really great falls, but the hikes to really see them were too intense for our family. FYI, it was in the low 80’s but anytime you’re visiting a hot spring the steam adds humidity and makes the temps even less tolerable. Take lots of water!! Only a few stops have places to sit down to eat, so plan accordingly-it’s easy to spend the whole day inside the park getting from one place to the next. Roads are about 30-40mph, and animal jams are common at the west entrance. The maps they give out when you pay to enter the park (good for a week’s worth of trips in/out of the park - there’s a separate fee to drive south into Grand Teton National Park) have a ton of info and we used it every day. Don’t be fooled by the Grand Prismatic Spring photo - you cant get that shot from the boardwalks there! Stop a little sooner for the hike to the overlook (Fairy Falls maybe?), but it may not be enough for that National Geographic quality photo - I hear that was taken by drone lol. The boardwalks are still worth walking though - a beautiful area all the way around.","August 19, 2019",Soooo much to see!,0,"Burbank, Washington",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is a magical place.  As we headed toward the South exit of the park I felt the land around me change. It became ordinary again.  The types and density of trees, the underbrush, the light and shadow were still the same; but now they felt ""normal"".  There was a definite feeling of having stepped out of a land touched with magic and returning to  the everyday world. I felt I had discovered where the Ring of Galadriel must lie now. In Yellowstone. It was like stepping across the border of Lothorian and leaving that land.There are three categories that make Yellowstone extraordinary.1.  Geothermal.  This is what Yellowstone is famous for.  Geysers, steaming deep-blue hot pools, mud pots (blub-blub-blub)--one of our favorites for whatever reason.  It's part of why you're here and you should definitely take some of the boardwalks to view these.  It's like no where else on earth.  Old Faithful goes off every 90 minutes these days.  I remember when it used to be an hour but underground changes (and vandalism) have modified that.  But it's still like clockwork.  The park posts the schedule of when it will be going off next.  A particularly good quick tour is the Lower Geyser Basin boardwalk off the main highway.  It has some of the best samples of the main types of geothermal sights:A geyser that never seems to stop erupting A gorgeous deep blue pool surrounded by variegated oranges (Silex Pool).  In some ways it's more accessible and beautiful than the Great Prismatic Pool which requires that you be at some distance above to get a full look at it.  The best mud pots in the park.And even a couple fumoroles thrown in. (openings in the earth that spew out columns of steam)2.  Animals.  If nothing else, you are guaranteed to see buffalo (bison).  There are herds of them in the northeast portion of the park (LemarValley) but that's not on the main route for most tourists.  But in most areas of the part you'll see a stray here or there.  It was night when we saw our first bison.  Cars were stopped on the road and we wondered what was happening.  Then walking toward us in the headlights of the cars ahead a black buffalo appeared.  He seemed a bit confused, but was making his way down the road between the cars.  He came toward us and walked right past our car on his way.  On another occasion, one was strolling through a parking lot.  They move steadily with a mind and destination of their own.  Tourists got out their cameras as he moved through the parking lot, and then strolled up a hillside.  In our too-brief stay there we also saw elk, 6 bears and 2 wolves.  We were lucky to see the wolves.  As we drove by a lot of cars were parked along the road (the best signal for seeing animals by the way), with some large, expensive cameras out on tripods.  We asked what they were looking at and they said there was an animal carcass out there.  When we came by later it was raining but I got out and found out two wolves had shown up.  After a lot of help I spotted them in the telephoto of my camera and we got some pictures.  Pretty cool.  3.  Scenic Landscapes.  Yellowstone is a wilderness.  It is viewed as such and maintained that way--but with a lot of tourists running through it!  The are mountain overlooks, meandering meadow streams, waterfalls and canyons.  The Yellowstone River is gorgeous and you'll see classic shots as you drive along and stop at various lookouts.  It's a big, wild and wonderful landscape.Be sure to spend at least two full days just to sample the main sights.  Ideally you'll spend a week to give you browsing time and a more in-depth look at the park.There is magic and wonder in Yellowstone. I now wonder where the other two rings are being kept. Which opens the door to a new adventure... Any candidates?","August 18, 2019",Land of Wonder,1,"Sunland, South Africa",5

Yellowstone National Park,"We are currently in adventure around US and Canada. With that, planning was critical for attractions like Badlands etc. Yellowstone planning is also required before you go. The two loops take time and if you want to explore can not be done in a day. We did the north loop first arriving at 0800 hrs and leaving the park at 1800hours being tired. We did the south loop in same time period. The 20 hour tour allow d us to feel fulfilled having hiked, walked and witnessed so much, but still not 100% mind you. Yes, we saw Bison. These beautiful beats were experienced in south loop at time of visit mid August 2019 just past Old Faithful in the planes area. The 100 plus bison were in very close proximity to the road way. Of course with that, expect delays due to traffic. You will also experience some drivers who will just stop and be a tourist without moving over in turn out etc. Be prepared. You will also experience some visitors who are ignorant in danger of getting too close to these magnificent beasts. Why they exit their vehicle to try and be within metres of them dumbfounds me, so I will as said chalk it up as ignorance versus stupidity in not adhering to advisories from signs and rangers. Calculate your south loop with Old Faithfuls calculated blow. The calculated blow was within five minutes so we had little down time. I’d arrive 20 -30 minutes prior to to get a decent seat (lots of room) watch the spout and then explore rest of area. There is just so much to do in Yellowstone, this review can not do it justice, do all I can say is do your research on the numerous attractions, plan time and add a couple hours for traffic delay for bison interference, bear sightings or construction. As of this writing, we were delayed 30 minutes via construction alone on north loop (one lane). Bring your lunch and use the picnic tables provided to explore an area. If hiking, please do take bear spray and/or bear bells etc. Plan,plan,plan and enjoy, enjoy and enjoy. You will. You will glad you did not rush.

Yellowstone National Park,"In the summer, my family visited the Yellowstone National park. the scene and experience is great. a must see!here is a few lessons and tips we learned , hope helpful for other people.1. how to save money on plane tickets:we directly fly to Jackson Hole Airport from Washington DC . it is a little bit expensive.( more than $750 each person for round trip), later, my friend suggests me that we can fly to Billings, MT, it is only about $470. then we can drive about 2.5 hours to yellow stone.2. book two hotels , instead of onesince Yellowstone is so big, it's better book different hotels, so that you can visit the places near your hotel more convenient. for example, the fist day, you can book hotel near the south entrance ( such as Jackson Wyoming). so that you can visit the Great Teton park. the next days, you can book hotel near West Yellowstone. 3. if you like to see animals in Yellowstone, try to bring a good Binoculars so that you will a better chance to see them4. bring your own lunch/drink and bring a plastic cooler, so that you can save lot's of time to enjoy the scene, instead of sitting in the hotels5. rent a SUV, and try to get up as early as possible to visit the park ( we get up on 5:00am).","August 6, 2019",must see!,4,"Vienna, Virginia",5

That, and there is just so much to see and do!The roads are in great condition, and have lots to well marked stops and cutout, at almost every turn. You could stop every 500 feet for a new and fantastic view!We went to Old Faithful and hiked the surrounding area. It was very busy, but well spread out to accommodate the masses.While it is probably the most expensive National Park in the USA, it is absolutely one of the best, and worth your time to go.While they do have services in the park, best be advised to fill up before you go.

Yellowstone National Park,"I had no idea what to expect and it was amazing that we flew into Bozeman, Montana yet drove through Wyoming and Idaho. We stayed outside the park in Island Park which is a bit far...I would suggest you stay closer! Drive slow in tge park, you never know what is going to be around the corner or run into the road. We went the speed limit but still had to swerve to miss a couple of squirrels...would have felt awful do happy we had time to avoid them. We didn't see a lot of animals during mid day coming in through the West Gate but we should have been up early or waited until 4pm & later when the animals are more active. The sun was quite hot from about 10-4 so the animals seek shade...just like us!

The mission of the trip was to do photography of various animals that these parks have to offer. We were not disappointed. We photographed American bisons, Grizzly and Black bear. Grizzly bear with its cubs was a wonderful opportunity. We also photographed beautiful Elks, Sheeps, Bald eagles, wolfs etc. overall it was amazing time of the year to photograph and witness these wonderful animals. I would advise to visit between May and July. These are the best months to see above mentioned animals.

Nevertheless it was same impressive as years ago.It’s such a wonderland - and it’s just the power and beauty of nature. Sure - you will hardly find a spot without crowds of people. But if you do start in the early morning at least some time is not so fully packed. Enjoy hikes, drive around, take your time, be impressed what nature has to offer! Staying overnight in the park (if not on a campground) cost a small fortune. Whether it’s worth it or not - up to the decision of everyone themselves.","July 29, 2019",Amazing natural wonderland,9,"Appleton, Wisconsin",5
Yellowstone National Park,We had a wonderful time in Yellowstone. It wasn’t even as crowded as one would think for July. I do wish people would educate themselves about the dangers ahead of time so they can make good decisions. There was a fatal accident while we were there shutting down the roads for two plus hours. I personally saw a family pressing a child’s hands into the ground in front of grand prismatic (as I pointed out to them it was right next to a sign saying not to do that). Stay the recommended distance from animals- a 9 year girl was thrown while we were there. I just feel like if everybody educated themselves on the dangers of Yellowstone and acted appropriately we would all be able to safely enjoy its wonders. ,"July 28, 2019","Be educated, respectful, and make good decisions",39,"Bozeman, Montana",5

Old Faithful, the seismic activity all over, the huge lake, the bubbling little ponds of earth, the biological life which can live in acid, the vapour coming out of earth all over the place..... it was simply exciting. The lodging offered in the park is also well serving, whether it's the restaurants, the helpful staff, the rooms themselves, the environmental cleanliness..... all great.

Yellowstone National Park,"There is millions of acres of natural beauty to enjoy. I am just not sure if it's worth the money unless that's not an issue for you. Geysers, valleys, bison and elks quickly loose their appeal particularly if you set aside several days to visit numerous spots and run into similar experience. It's called a bears country but with less than 1400 bears spread over such a vast area, chances of you spotting one are less unless you time your trip perfectly. Food choice are also very limited.Hayden valley, Grand Canyon of Yellowstone and nearby GTNP and Jackson Hole are quite enjoyable though.","July 26, 2019",A lot of hype,47,"San Jose, California",3
Yellowstone National Park,Yellowstone park is wonderful and really is a bunch of different sites connected by a loop. It is very crowded every day of the week and you will wait for a parking space at the best sites until about six. Go to the intro to Yellowstone ranger program to plan your visit as best you can. Buy your pass ahead of the gate. It really is larger than it looks on the maps. Travel by car is necessary but restricted to 45mph or less.

Wow! On the animals, if wolves are on your bucket list, here's some hopefully helpful advice: (1) set your alarm for 4 a.m. (2) Drive to the Lamar Valley in the North (easy if you're in Gardiner or Mammoth Springs, harder if you're further south or west). (3) Look for the guys with the expensive scopes or the wolf-watching tour buses. Stop where they stop. If there are wolves and grizzlies they will know where they are. Helpful hint: Take the rangers' advice seriously on keeping your distance from animals.

Yellowstone National Park,"First, we visited the park about 35 years ago and then again this year in 2019. (An earlier planned visit was delayed due to poor weather conditions in the mid-west as well as late snow falls and rock slides on main arteries.) Sadly, I have to report that we should have never gone back, but held onto the beautiful memories of the past.Do not go to Yellowstone during July and August if you can help it. I realize that many families cannot travel any other time due to school restrictions. If you are a couple and the weather permits, visit during late spring or early fall, even winter is beautiful. That in itself would eliminate many people flooding into the park during the summer months.The highlight of this trip was Chief Joseph Scenic Byway. It was gorgeous and untainted and hardly a visitor was there but us. Stay in Cody, Wyoming, overnight and get an early morning start, heading north on 120 to 296 toward the north gate at Cooke City, Montana. (Gas up first...no stations and no stores.) Everything was pristine and the mountains and valleys jaw-dropping. Entering into the park at the North Gate there was little traffic for 17 miles to Mammoth Springs. Buffalo, elk, bear and antelope were spotted on the wide open fields.Here the park changes and for the worst. Mammoth Springs, Old Faithful, etc. once kept primitive is now a congestion of government buildings, hotels, restaurants, rest rooms, asphalt and a host of other things including road-work construction. RV's (Large ones) and tour buses hogged up multiple parking spaces that were limited in the first place. Picnic tables, scare, were at a premium or non-existent. One site, Midway Geyser Basin was backed up about one mile with every available parking space filled in the lot and up and down the highway. RV's were jammed cock-eyed in road side spaces...in short it was a nightmare of congestion and we passed it by.People were everywhere, pouring out of tour buses, campers, cars, and motorcycles roared down the road jarring the tranquility. Signs ask that slow drivers pull off to allow those who want to drive 45 miles an hour get by. This was ignored on the most part. Slow drivers kept their grinding pace while insane chances to pass was taken by quite a few people. In short, the revisit was at the worst possible time and in the worst possible situation. So wish we would have passed Yellowstone by and opted to remember the park as it once was.Suggestion: Get up early and drive to the site you want to most see. You have a better chance at a parking space and dealing with less people. Visit when the water is flowing...several of the geyser basins were bone dry, likewise, Mammoth Springs had little water and walking was laborious over the boardwalks built to view every conceivable point reachable. Gravitate to the less viewed areas of the park and absorb what is left of its natural beauty. Trees, valleys, animals, lakes, streams, water falls, etc. Try to discover the hidden spots and the quiet nooks if you must visit in the high season and enjoy!","July 25, 2019",Yellowstone National Park Changed Greatly,143,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",4

The color, the awe, they are so intriguing! Also, so much wild life! We were able to see a grizzly for the first time! We loved the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The hike to the massive water fall was incredible! Must be able to hike back up however going down seemed more challenging than going back up. A must is seeing the Grand Prismatic Spring from above. You can view it from the boardwalk but it’s much more stunning from above. Hike is about 3 miles round trip but so worth the hike! ","July 24, 2019",Amazing sights!,5,Minnesota,5
Yellowstone National Park,"The sheer variety of what's on offer in Yellowstone is mind-blowing. The geothermal sights are world-leading. There is so much else though, that whilst maybe not the best examples in the world, are still fantastic. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone may not quite be the Grand Canyon itself, but it is spectacular. The Lemar valley is hardly the real Serengeti, but it is a great spot for wildlife. The park is absolutely huge and you do need at least 3 days really to do it any kind of justice. The volume of tourists, is quite off-putting.

Yellowstone National Park,"We got up early and drove into the park. The beginning was unspectacular: after a fire some years ago, a lot of the hillsides are covered in felled, dead trees. Then there was a visitor centre that was almost empty. Guess that's what we get for being early.Things soon got immensely better, though. Spent a long time around some mini-pools of volcanic mud and geysers. Amazing stuff. But then we found the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. Parked the car. Bit of a walk, for what seemed like average views. Then the views turned spectacular. Deep river value, rapids below, volcanic deposits. Words don't do it justice.Later in the day, more volcanic stuff. Terraces of sulphur deposits. all kinds of colours, bubbling and swirling. Like a waterfall only in rocks. Safe walkways between viewpoints. Bit of a stink, but so impressive.Lots of other minor wonders along the way. Surprisingly few animals, though we did see some bison grazing. Quite a large area to cover and we certainly didn't see it all, but what an impressive place!A long drive to an exit and from there to a place to stay. We were glad we'd had an early start.","July 23, 2019",Outstanding natural beauty,184,"Okayama Prefecture, Japan",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We spent four days in the Park but could have used another four days. It is a majestic place, especially when you think that you are in the caldera of a super large volcano. The eruption that created such a caldera must have the mother of all eruptions. I did meet a geologist that is mapping all the geysers who informed me that he and his wife would be very happy to pass away if the super volcano was to erupt once again. Alas he did confess rather forlornly that there would be no eruption during his lifetime. Without a doubt, the start of the Park is the Old Faithful geyser that is located 50 metres from the Old Faithful Inn. There is ample room to sit or stand to watch and appreciate this marvellous act of nature. The park is huge so there is plenty of driving to do from one natural wonder to another. Just remember that next door to Old Faithful there are more geysers and this area of the Park is full of boardwalks that certainly make it much easier to go from one area to another.

Yellowstone National Park,"After reading many reviews written on this very popular national park, we visited the place with high expectation.Our drive started from Salt Lake City and stoped for lunch at Idaho Falls and continued to Yellowstone West. Frankly the drive was boring.Since arriving at Yellowstone West was early at about 2:00pm, we decided to see the ""must see"" attraction, Old Faithful, before checking in to our hotel. We visited Madison and Mid-way Geyser basin on our way. Arrived at the Old Faithful about 15 minutes prior to its eruption. Alas, it was a disappointment. The eruption lasted less than 5 minutes and the height was not more than 50 feet. The next day on our way to see the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, we visited Norris Geyser Basin and Mommoth Hot Springs to see more geothermal features, rather enjoyable but not exciting. The waterfalls at Grand Canyon of Yellowstone are beautiful. Again, they are not awesome.During two days of our visit inside the park, we could see some bisons.After staying anther night at West Yellowstone, we went to visit Grand Teton National Park via West Thumb.Frankly, Yellowstone National is lovely but not exciting and amazing.

Yellowstone National Park,"First off people need to learn how to FOLLOW RULES while in Yellowstone.Don’t get me wrong Yellowstone had a lot cool things to do. However I wish I didn’t stay 4 nights in Yellowstone and 2 nights in the Grand Tetons. I wish I did 5 nights in the Tetons and only one in Yellowstone. Ok so geysers are cool and same with hot springs. But my 11 year old daughter said it best. They all look the same after a while. You have to see Old Faithful and some hot springs but it gets boring after that. In July it is so busy with people that are just clueless about things. Like hey walk on the right side of the boardwalk. Watch your kids as in hold their hand. We watched a kid try to walk off the boardwalk in a hot spring area and their parents of course were not paying attention. If you like wildlife viewing Lamar Valley is where I recommend. Hayden Valley is also pretty good. If you like hikes I can recommend an easy one that is pretty flat and about 5 miles round trip. Riddle Lake, it opens July 15 and there is a lot of Beer activity there. So bring beer spray with you. Safety safety safety! I bought a book in Yellowstone. Deaths in Yellowstone second edition. I would have named it the Idiots of Yellowstone. Follow the rules when your here. People who work here have a lot more knowledge than you do about the area. I just laugh at the mother with 4 kids who walked by us then said to her children bear spray is so unnecessary. Yes it’s so unnecessary to not have it while camping in a campground where you need to lock all your food up in a bear box and food is not allowed to be stored in your car. If your camping and your getting irritated because of the long wait while checking in just deal with it. The workers will go over every safety detail with you line by line in regards to bears. Remember they know more than you do. You are not an expert your a tourist. One last thing when you visit here. Please learn how to use pull outs. Stopping in the middle of the road is well not recommended. Now if there is a long line of cars stopped in the road it’s one of two things. Construction or a bear. Now if it’s a bear and you want to get out of your car to take a picture of it, be smart about. Remember they can and will run a lot faster than you.","July 21, 2019",I wish I did the trip different,56,"Medical Lake, Washington",4
Yellowstone National Park,"Been on our bucket list for years and it certainly did not disappoint. From the moment we drove in through the south entrance and for the following four full days Yellowstone just kept delivering. The western side is more geysers and hot springs. Old Faithfully is impressive but we thought some of the other hydrothermal attractions were as good. Do see the Paint Pots, the Abyss Pool and The Grand Prismatic Spring - just incredible. And do drive the Firehole Lake Drive which is normally less busy than the main attractions but still has impressive features of its own. Mammoth Hot Springs is a must. The Eastern side is more open and wildlife abounds so do drive this loop. Yellowstone Lake is also impressive. All over the Park you see bears (we said another day in the park and more bears seen!), deer, Elk, Bison and much more. Perhaps our highlight was watching a stag deer walk across one of the many fast flowing rivers within the park - just unforgettable.

The earth steamed right in front of me. Everyone needs to see this place. You can enjoy many sites just by driving to it and parking or with a short walk. This was good for my mother who has difficulty walking and tires easily. Be advised it slow going through the park as it is only 45 mph through most of the park. The roads and mountainous terrain make careful driving a must. You will need at least 2 days to drive through the whole park.

Once we finally got into the park, that was pretty much the worst thing we experienced. It is $35 a car to gain entrance. There is so much to see here at the park. Beautiful geysers and pools, tons of wildlife (buffalo, elk, deer, bear, big horn sheep, moose..you get the idea) With that however you also get stupid people who think its ok and safe to just walk right up to the wildlife with a camera and snap that photo. If you see that, just turn and walk away because you really don't want to witness a death or mauling of any kind to damper your vacation. The roads are very nice and well maintained. Some parts the speed limit seemed almost too fast for us Washingtonians but we just let people go around us as we pulled over. We were in no hurry and wanted to see it all in the time we had.

My trip took brought me in at the NE entrance, through the Lamar Valley, down past Old Faithful, lunch at Yellowstone Lake and then on southwards through the Tetons. Jackson is a buzzing place to stay overnight if you can The week earlier snow drift had blocked roads so this is the route for only the warmest months. Hotels can be expensive if you prefer to stay in the park and gas is 25% more expensive too.

Yellowstone National Park,"Grand Canyon was number one but this one beats it. Takes more than a day to see it all, waterfalls, geysers, animals and views. Several geysers continue to spout water while others just bubble. Some are very colorful (Prism for instance). We got to see a brown bear on side of the road and two young black bears (two different times). Pronghorn deer, Elk, coyotes, long horn sheep, 2 ospreys in their nest and of course lots of bison. We were stopped for around 20-25 minutes while a herd slowly crossed the road. Old Faithful is a must, however probably the most crowded section of the park. Old Faithful Inn has a balcony over the entrance with a lot of seating and view of the geyser. Recommend driving around the figure eight, although we also drove along Lamar valley to see wildlife. We originally booked a tour, however, the bus was in an accident and never picked us up. I think this was a blessing as driving allows you to stop where you want and for as long as like. Recommend early morning to see wildlife. Yellowstone hotel restaurant was most elegant and pricey but a nice change. Hotel not much from outside (it's yellow), but very nice inside.

It included 4 days of tours that started at 6 am & usually ended at 3 pm, our meals, & a knowledgeable tour guide. We learned about the lake, the diverse animals, the 4 types of thermal features, the types of trees, the history of the park.

Yellowstone National Park,Awesome place to visit. Completely surpassed our expectations. It’s huge. Probably the best place to base yourself is West Yellowstone lots of accommodation. We rented a condo 20 mins drive outside of the town in the peace and quiet of the countryside. It was worth the extra drive. Lots of driving to do getting from each feature in the park but they’re all different. More geysers than you can imagine not just Old Faithfull who did his stuff every 90 minutes. There is information posted in the visitor centre at the site giving the estimated time of next eruption there’s also an App you can get for this info. The colors of the hot springs especially The Grand Prismatic Spring are amazing. Don’t miss out Mammoth Hot Springs or Norris Geyser Basin. We spent 4 very full days in the park exhausted ourselves more days would have made it a bit more relaxed.Tons of lovely Bison with young especially in Hayden Valley in the evening. We didn’t get as far as the Lamar Valley which is also great for wildlife spotting. Plenty of female Elk some with young. We saw male Elks in the distance in the Hayden Valley. We saw a sleeping Bear not too far into the park from the West Entrance.Weather in early July was good high 60’s to low 80’s we had a little rain on the last day which made the temperature drop dramatically to the 50’s so be prepared for variations in temperature take plenty of layers.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is a family vacation we will all remember. You can hike for miles on trails or drive from place to place watching out your window or take a short stroll on a smooth boardwalk. We spent 7 days in the park and we already have a list of things we want to do next time. Staying in the park may cost more but it's worthwhile expense as you can stay off the grid, disconnected from the everyday life hassles. In addition you'll get to attractions before the crowds come pouring in the park. Of the places we stayed is recommend Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Canyon Lodge, not Grant Village.

My favorite part is the trail behind Old Faithful - I think it has something like 25% of the world's geysers and hot springs. I've been there twice and will go again. One thing to note - it's an ENORMOUS park, and you will be in the car a lot. And summer is pretty crowded. But you will probably get to see roaming bison, pronghorn, and maybe a bear.","July 11, 2019",My favorite national park!,18,,5

Yellowstone National Park,"Arrived 10am at the west entrance, to be honest would have been better to arrive much earlier. We'd already purchased a 12 month pass, worth every penny for $80 we'd have spent over $200 on the parks visited. Anyhow Yellowstone is a colourful world of pools, geysers and wildlife.We drove south to Old Faithful and then onto the lake, stopping off at all the various walks around the fizzing bubbling pools. Take a lightweight coat/jersey, its not the warmest of places, packed lunch and water.Be prepared to queue for parking places at all the stop offs. We spent 7 hours and only got to the lake. The Mammoth stuff up north looked good on the pictures. The best tip i can give you is go as early as you can. The town is also really busy with quite a few 'tat and t shirt' shops. We had a 4 hour round trip drive and was out 13 hours. So be prepared. The only downside of Yellowstone is the lack of parking spaces, you can be sat 15 mins or so waiting, theres drones of cars let into the park, even after 5pm it was still queuing. Despite this its a great unusual place to visit.","July 10, 2019",Great colourful day,33,"Wigan, United Kingdom",4
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone was beautiful, a little cool at the beginning around July 18 but warmed up into the two weeks we were there. We stayed the bulk of our time in West Yellowstone , the drive in each day wasn’t very far to make a couple of attractions each day without rushing. We did stay a couple of days in Cooke City Montana and drove to Lamar Valley a couple of times. For our trip we found getting up very early was best ,by the time everyone else is out of bed we were well on our way and ahead of the largest crowds. We did see many signs in the park that said,” no RV’s...” I assume because parking was limited in many attractions but I am not sure that is an assumption. There was some road construction between Norris and Mammoth that did cause delays. We were at Old Faithful twice and the early morning had the least amount of people. I guess it depends on where you are from and prices you are accustomed to but for us it was well above what we would pay for food. For the entire trip gas was from 2.99 to 3.60 per gallon, the highest was Cooke City ,Montana.Hope this helps, pack a lunch!","July 10, 2019",Crowded but worth it!,2,"Abilene, Texas",5

Basically whole east and west side, lower and upper. Everything was breath taking and unreal. Take lots water, sunscreen and good walking shoes. Seen black bears, bison and elk. We spent 3 days and seen all we wanted to see. Two days were 10.5-11 hrs one day was about 4-5 hours. Shorter days you could for sure see it all in more days. Some trails closed for bear activity and hazardous conditions. So much to see and do! Weather was good, it’s the mountains though so plan for rain at least one day or sporadic throughout the day. We only had one rain day which was a shorter day and we spent it in mammoth. We planned 4 full days thinking we’d need it but we did long days so didn’t need it as we got done what we wanted to see. So worth seeing, nothing like it. No two geysers are the same.

It's not everyday you drive by the road and all of a sudden a herd of buffaloes just happen to be crossing by. The park is just full of life. From wildlife to the hot springs and geysers there's just a lot to see. I would recommend 3-4 days to site-see without any rush. Also bring some snacks and liquid. There are places to eat outside the park but with traffic and so much to see you will not want to leave the park anytime soon. The park is huge with a lot of entrances but it's your choice where to start from. Since i was young Yellowstone was always a dream of mine to see in person. I was definitely struck by its beauty, power and made me feel insignificant just to meditate how awesome creation is. Do not hesitate. If you ever have the chance to visit, just pack and go.

We saw more animals this time around then in the visits before especially deer, elk, and buffalo but we also were blessed to see a black bear, moose, white wolf, fox and a momma grizzly and two babies.

The other thing we discovered is that going to see some of the major attractions toward the end of the day/ dusk is so much better because there are only a few people around.

Yellowstone National Park,"This is a journey of a lifetime for me. I always dream to visit Yellowstone. And finally, I made it in June 2019. It was a beautiful thrilling experience. I can't express the beauty and the thrill in any of my words. The nature at it's best.Few tips while you prepare for Yellowstone trip plan:1. First of all the park is huge. It is more 3000 sqmi. Though the park map is looking small, but don't go by that, it is time taking and huge. So plan at least for 2-3 days for the park.2. The park attractions are pretty much there in the 8 shaped road route. So plan your trip accordingly.3. Don't try to finish things in a hurry. Enjoy the beauty of the beast 'Nature'.4. Keep enough time in your hand as there is a high chance of traffic jam because of wild animals on the road, mostly Bison. In our 3 days in the park, 4 times we need faced traffic jam becasue of the animals.5. Parking area in each attraction is limited, so keep some buffer time for parking.6. Try to avoid long weekends in July-September. During this time tourist visitor are maximum and chances of wild animals (other than Bison and Deer) are minimum.7. Always keep a safe distance from wild animals.8. majority of the trails are not wheelchair or stroller accessible. But major attraction trails are mostly yes. So if you are traveling with a kid or aged person, get all the required information before planning.9. Finally, enjoy the natural beauty from different angles and in a different mood. It is offering all possibilities.We had experienced Wild wolf hunting deer, Brown Grizzly Bear, Moose, Dear, Antelope, and Bison.Also the last point, I traveled with my 4-year-old son, it is compltely safe to travel with kids. You just need to keep a close look and careful. Kids are always very cooperative and energetic. And in this hectic trip, my kid's energy helped me a lot to keep running.","July 4, 2019",Journey of a lifetime,29,New Jersey,5
Yellowstone National Park,Beautiful environment! I was surprised by how chilly it was (37-50*F) while we visited in June but the views were terrific. The geysers we stopped at on the way to Old Faithful were more impressive to me than Old Faithful. We entered through the north entrance and stopped at Mammoth soon after we entered. I found this to be my favorite spot. It was very crowded at Old Faithful even with the cold weather. The gift shop at Old Faithful was worth the stop. They had great prices on clothing and most souvenirs. The one thing I was surprised by was the fact that most of the driving within Yellowstone is up and down mountains. It was a little stressful and as the day went on the roads became more and more crowded. We were unable to stopped at the Yellowstone Grand Canyon because there was no more parking spots left. The park does require LOTS of walking so be sure to wear proper shoes. ,"July 4, 2019",Beautiful Environment ,5,"Chicago, Illinois",5

For example if you want geothermal activity Rotorua in New Zealand is far more impressive. If you want forests and mountains then the Black Forest in Germany is better and if you want open plains and really wild animals then you should go to South Africa. In four days we saw 1 bear and it was so far away it could have been a rock - I have seen more bears on the roadside in Canada. Also there are far too many people. It is extremely difficult to get into any of the car parks and there are always long queues for the toilets.

Yellowstone National Park,"I'm going to discuss things I believe are more important than stating the obvious, such as ""Don't miss Old Faithful"" or ""The park is beautiful."" Bear these notes in mind when you go.The park is, naturally, very popular. We entered via the West Entrance. At this entrance, and probably others, stay in the far right if you have a pass (annual/senior/military/etc. or bought an entry ticket earlier). It is about 14 miles from the gate to the turn to main park attractions. Old Faithful is to the right (south) at the 3-way stop. Mammoth Hot Springs is to the left (north).People stop to look at animals, even if the signs say not to. This happened to us on the 16-mile drive to Old Faithful. As a result, it took over 2 (!!!) hours to drive 3 miles. Many people turned around out of frustration. They should have waited, because suddenly traffic was good all the way to the Old Faithful complex.It is difficult to find parking at the Old Faithful complex. However, as I have a handicapped placard, I discovered there are plenty of handicapped spaces outside the visitors center. If you have a h/c placard or plate, head directly there. Don't drive around aimlessly looking for a h/c spot elsewhere.Old Faithful is NOT very faithful. Eruption time for us was scheduled for 4:53 p.m. plus or minus 10 minutes. She finally blew about 5:15.If you turn left to go to Mammoth Hot Springs, be aware there is road construction. You may not reach the sign telling you to turn off your engine, but if you are stopped in the line, do so. You most likely will be there several minutes. The road under construction/repair is not paved.It is difficult to find parking at Mammoth Hot Springs. Drive a little further to the visitors complex and walk back.We spoke with a couple who arrived via the North Gate. They encountered a large number of bison in the road, including one in front of their car that would not move. A ranger told him to just touch the beast with his car and it would move. It did. (They showed us a great video they took of the bison all around their car).I hope readers find these notes of use to further enjoy one of America's greatest, if not THE GREATEST, national parks.","June 25, 2019","Info, not Plaudits",94,"Whispering Pines, North Carolina",5
Yellowstone National Park,"It sucked. Nothing but bison and tourists. No elk left to see, and that is a shame. It's a long drive to get there, only to sit in long traffic lines, without seeing anything but mud pots and a geyser.","June 25, 2019",Don't waste your time!,2,"Sandpoint, Idaho",1
Yellowstone National Park,"This park is beautiful, I've never seen anything like it and am not aware of any other area like this, at least in the US. We visited in the middle of June with 4 kids, spent 2 days (spent night in West Yellowstone) we hit all the highlights, plus some extra we hadn't planned on. That being said, I'm reading a lot of complaints, this is not a spur of the moment place to go, the park is HUGE, there is road construction in several spots, parking in the more popular areas is horrible, expect to wait for a parking space. My advice is to plan out as much as you can, go very early in the morning, try not to go in July and August, and bring clothes for any temperature. We spent a long day and were able to see almost the whole park, later in the evening it was freezing and even started snowing (yes, in June) while we waited for Old Faithful. We had planned for 2 days, so we went back in the morning did some extra smaller attractions, watched Old Faithful again, plus walked the boardwalks behind her, and had lunch at the Old Faithful Inn, we got there at 11:30 when they opened, no waiting.","June 24, 2019",Awe inspiring!,52,"Warren, Pennsylvania",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Mountains, wide vistas, wildlife and geothermal features make this National Park truly unique. But be forewarned about the traffic. There are frequent delays due to traffic volume to the most popular features like Old Faithful. Constrained parking at other popular features like the Prismatic Spring is another problem.Lastly, we really do not know why the food offerings in the various Park Restaurants are so subpar. At one restaurant I had a hamburger which made McDonalds look like a five star restaurant. And at another Park Restaurant, I had an Asian Wok dish which I found to be generally uneatable. Oh well, you’re not visiting Yellowstone for the food anyway.","June 23, 2019",Definitely the Best National Park,54,"Denver, Colorado",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Left Cody at 5am about 45 min drive to East entrance, there are restrooms at the entrance if you need them. Time constraints we had to do Yellowstone  in ac day, visited Lake Village briefly seeing Buffalo on route, before West Thumb, fantastic hot pools and mud pools spending the best part of an hour. The Old Faithful area is always busy with crowds waiting for the geyser to do it's stuff. This is where you really begin to notice how quickly  the park fills from mid morning. (Tip, there is more to it here than just Old Faithful walk the trails for other interesting Geysers and colourful rock formations so don't just leave. There's also a good shaded picnic area at the side of the car park). Traffic and lines for parking meant entry to Grand Prismatic Spring and sights at Madison was not possible which is why many plan a visit over two days. Then between Madison and Norris traffic ground to a halt before moving at a snail's pace, the problem a massive herd of Buffalo crossing the road just south of Norris. With time marching on and with our intention to leave Yellowstone via the northeast entrance and entering Montana before travelling back to Cody on the infamous Beartooth and Chief Joseph highways (reviewed separately) we gave the Norris a miss and instead made our last stop Mammoth Hot Springs. This was brilliant there was some parking available, we were delayed a bit by more traffic hold ups due to people stopping in totally inappropriate places to try and photograph a bear on adjoining land. Mammoth Hot Springs was home to numerous young Elk and Moose which were untroubled by the many photos being taken of them. From here it is just under 50 miles to the Northeast entrance and entering route we passed many Buffalo and their calves. Once at the northeast entrance it is an approximate 2 hour journey back to Cody via Beartooth and Chief Joseph highways on which I have also done reviews. All in All a good but tiring day getting back to Cody at 8.30pm.","June 22, 2019",Be sure to arrive early & mist can be done in a day,87,"Ayr, United Kingdom",5
Yellowstone National Park,"This is bucket list type material. The things you'll see at Yellowstone are simply amazing. In a world filled with screens, computers, and video games, this place is such a breath of fresh air. Our kids (7, 4 and 1) all had an absolute blast here. From seeing the wildlife, to the geysers, getting the play in the snow and just climbing on rocks, this was so much better than a trip to any concrete jungle.  One of the things about driving around Yellowstone, especially the northern portion, is how quickly and drastically the terrain changes. One minute you're in a plain as far as the eye can see, and then you're surrounded by mountains, boulders, or forest. It's a truly special place, and I'm also impressed with how easy the roads are to traverse. The driving around the park is breezy, despite the mountains, and there are plenty of villages to stop and grab something to eat or recharge with some coffee. There are also gas stations throughout the park, which I originally wondered if there would be any, which is helpful when doing so much driving around the park. Make sure to give yourself at least 4 days at Yellowstone, and possibly the entire week. There is so much to see here, that you'll have no issue filling up the days.","June 21, 2019",An absolute must,797,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We just returned from a Western trip that included visits to Yellowstone, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Grand Teton and Yosemite National Parks and every one of them was quite spectacular. These are parks and you must have an appreciation for this kind of beauty. I saw many a bored teenager walking around and not enjoying the beauty, mostly because there is little to no cell service in most of the park. We spent three days touring around and we saw animals, geysers, waterfalls, magnificent mountains, majestic Forests and scenes that literally took our breath away. Take your time, you cannot see this park in a day, but you will appreciate whatever time you can spend there. Be ready for crowds in the summertime and also some cool weather. We had snow in June and I've heard they get snow even in July.Two suggestions to the wonderful people look after our parks. Ban smoking all together in the park and anyone found tossing their cigarette butts on the pavement or anywhere else be fined. Also, offer visitors a small garbage bag and encourage them to pick up garbage as they travel through the park. Turn the bag of garbage in at the end of your visit and each day a name is selected and they win a one year Park membership. The Park Rangers deserve our respect and appreciation because they do the fantastic job.

Yellowstone National Park,"Our family took a road trip, and one of our last stops was Yellowstone! We had fun seeing the sights. The melting snow created beautiful impromptu water falls. There was some traffic. It was mentioned in the beginning of the park about the traffic, but we didnt get into traffic until we left. Word of caution. Dress in layers. On the day we went it was sunny, windy, and cold. We even snlw flurries in June! Being from the south we didnt expect it to be so cold in June. It was nonetheless a great time.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is truly breathtaking and by far the most rewarding family vacation we have taken. We only had two full days but we were able to hit all the places we wanted to see in this time. If we go back again, we will probably allow 4 days so we are not quite as rushed. The entire park is clearly mapped out with signs and most the stops are off the main figure 8 road, which was great as our GPS rarely worked. We spent 1 day viewing all the big stops on the west side of the figure 8 (OF, Grand Prismatic, Norris Geyser Basin, Mammoth, few stops for wildlife viewing and landscape viewings.) The 2nd day we spent viewing the east side (Grand Canyon south rim, Lamar and Hayden Valley, Tower Fall.) We were out the door by 9am and having dinner back at OF Lodge by 6pm both days. We did have to stop at Grand Prismatic a couple times as the steam made the spring impossible to view. The first day we tried at 10am and 7pm with no luck but the second day we made the trek up to the overlook at Fairy Falls and we could view it very clearly even though it still looked like the people on the ground might not have been able to. We went the second week of June and it was crowded but not unbearable. We drove by Norris around lunchtime because the wait to park was significant but we were able to pull right up front about 2 hours later on our way back. We also parked along the road for the Grand Prismatic since we were able to walk much faster than people were parking. The weather is also very strange out there. When we arrived the forecast was 90% rain each day but we hardly saw any and when it did, it only lasted 10 minutes.The wildlife is amazing out there. We saw tons of bison everywhere, coyotes, and a grizzly bear. I highly recommend bear spray. We had quite the encounter with a black bear not far away while hiking in the Grand Tetons and we were very happy to have ours.","June 21, 2019",Amazing adventure,1,,5

There are a bunch of FREE ranger lead hikes all through the park. some are short (15 minutes) to a few long ones (2 or more hours). The rangers never fail to share information about the park and it's history.

Yellowstone National Park,"This was our first visit to Yellowstone, so we wanted to do it right. We went with a twelve hour tour out of Jackson - Brushback tours. This was a great idea because we saw everything on our Yellowstone list without the hassle of driving and under the guide a naturalist. We went the first week in June and couldn't have picked a better day - blue skies and comfortable temperatures. Every turn on the road bought new exciting adventures. We saw bison, a black bear, elk, pronghorn, and even a close up of a yellow-bellied Marmot. One thing about Yellowstone is that it can get crowded, and a bison or bear crossing can back up traffic for miles; they have the right of way. We saw both the lower and upper falls at Artist's Point, the paint and steam pots, and of course Old Faithful. Old Faithful was not too faithful on our day as it went off early and we luckily got to see most of it.

The wildlife is off the charts, we saw so many Bison which are amazing, crossing right in front of our stopped car and eating grass on the side of the road meters from our car window. We saw deer, elk, pronghorn, moose, black and grizzly bears and coyotes. The rivers and creeks were running high which made for great photos. A little bit of traffic but mainly when cars slow down / stop to see wildlife which is part of the fun.

Yellowstone National Park,"Day two of our road trip from Seattle delivered us safely to West Yellowstone without incident. The staff at the Yellowstone information centre filled us with knowledge while we waited to get into our room at the motel. Once that was done, we opted to fill the afternoon in by visiting some of the closer attractions in the park to get a feel for the place. A couple of thermal springs and the ""Mother of all Geysers"" Old Faithful.Yellowstone is one hell of a park. To give you an idea of the enormity, listen to this. After you queue at one of the entry booths and show your park pass, you drive through being in the State of Montana. A few of kilometres in, you cross a State border and you're now in Wyoming. Venture down to the south west part of the park and you're enjoying being in the State of Idaho. We did 70 miles (120 kilometres) just to Old Faithful and back. The place is only at the beginning of its tourist season but boy it's busy. Some roads and trails are still closed and there is no shortage of snow still about. Most of the car parks still have big piles that have been pushed out of the way. Many sections of road still have snow on the sides of them. Today we had our second adventure in the park and checked out some of the central and east attractions. (140 miles worth) The temperature varied throughout the day according to altitude. 15 degrees was probably the norm but as we crossed the continental divide it was down to about 7 degrees and there was a foot of snow everywhere. Not just on the road shoulders either. It was thick on the ground all the way all the way up the mountains. So what have we seen? Well if you wanted to study geology, this is the place. I'm not sure what's going on under the Earths surface here but it has been going on for a long time. The volcanic activity is mind blowing. Massive geyser basins and mud volcanoes, 40 kilometre long canyons and waterfalls. We've enjoyed walks on rugged trails sometimes descending 800 feet to view waterfalls and all have been well worth the effort. Hot springs abound and the sight of Yellowstone lake with the snow covered mountains around it are breathtaking. Driving between attractions, you are always conscious of the instability of the area as often there is smoke billowing from holes and pools in the middle of nowhere and occasionally from the road surface itself. There are big crowds everywhere we stop and often the car parks are at capacity with cars, buses and RV's. The weather is extremely changeable. Dark clouds can hide the blue sky in a matter of minutes and a quick downpour is over as quickly as it started.We're delighted with what we got to see in Yellowstone. It was a full two and a half days spent in the park and we clocked up almost 400 kilometres driving around to all of the points of interest. We were blessed again with the weather we experienced. We would have liked to see a bit more wildlife than we did but that's just the way it goes. We saw heaps of Bisons, Elk's, wild goats etc. but no sign of a bear. We had a wolf run across the road in front of us today which was something new to us.Geologically speaking, we have wonderful memories of many of the Park's attractions. The Mammoth Hot Springs was a display taking up acres of land that depicted different colours depending on which angle you looked at the travertine with the constant flow of hot water erupting from beneath the Earths surface. We also stood in awe of the petrified tree. To think that an ancient type of Redwood could have been incased in ash for millions of years turning it to stone is simply mind blowing. Old Faithful and the other geysers in the park are genuine examples of Mother Natures' ability to remind us of who the boss is. Get to Yellowstone and appreciate just how good Mother Nature is.","June 11, 2019",Beautiful Yellowstone Park,12,"Yarraville, Australia",5

Yellowstone National Park,"We live three hours from Yellowstone, in Montana. We try to visit Yellowstone once a year. In the summer, crowds in certain areas, and on the roads, can be a real headache. And although most visitors are well-behaved, there is a certain percentage that causes problems.Just got back from a three-day visit in mid-June, and here are our most recent recommendations for enjoying Yellowstone:1. See the major sights, but also seek out places of peace and calm. Yes, you really need to see Old Faithful, the historic and beautiful interior of Old Faithful Inn, the geyser basins at Norris and Mammoth Hot Springs. But in the summer, be prepared for huge crowds and a certain amount of difficult people at these places. To make your trip enjoyable, also seek out areas in Yellowstone that are less visited and more quiet. Stop at a picnic area and have lunch. Take a hike (but first, get bear spray and be ready to practice bear safety precautions). Try fishing. 2. Get out early. Most of the crowds and difficult people don't get moving early. So especially if you are going to visit the geysers and thermal areas, get there early (before 8 am, if possible). 3. Go on a horseback trail ride, ride the wagon at Roosevelt Lodge, take an organized hike with a ranger. Each of these deliver a genuine, Western national park experience. And since you will be led by a professional and are in a group, you don't have to worry so much about bear safety.4. Put away the electronic devices, relax, SLOW DOWN while driving. Get out your binoculars and scan the hills for wildlife. Look for wildflowers. Watch the sun go down. 5. Try the off-season. Winter can be fun (most of the park is ""closed,"" but you can drive to Mammoth and walk the thermal area or go cross-country skiing). Sp;ring and Fall are more accessible, although most lodging in the park is closed (just be ready for cold weather). The off-season helps you get some solitude.","June 11, 2019","Still worth a visit, but be smart to avoid crowds",348,"Helena, Montana",5

It’s been on our “Bucket List” for years, so we finally decided to just go for it! The park is stunning! It’s hard to put into words how beautiful it actually is, and pictures don’t do it justice. Make sure to gas up, and bring your own food, because the place is massive, and there are only a few places to stop for services. You can easily spend 3, or more days here. No way you can see everything in a day! We also purchased The Gypsy Guide App for Yellowstone, and it helped us out with the history of the park, and how to effectively navigate the roads as well!

There were a few places where we had a hard time finding parking. I can't even imagine what it must be like in July and August.

Keep food in the vehicle and stay hydrated. The drives between areas can be 50+ miles, but there is always something to see on the way. Watch the weather and any person with breathing problems would be wise to have canned oxygen available.

On our second day we were in Lamar Valley and saw a pack of wolves stalking a small herd of Bison and their calves. On our third day we saw a lone wolf and two coyotes stalking a Pronghorn along the Lamar River. We were fortunate enough to get video and pictures of that. The Rangers said that it’s rare for wolves to show themselves like that. We saw a Grizzly Bear guarding and feeding on a carcass and we also saw some Moose and of course the stoic Bison. Even if you took wildlife out of the equation the scenery is breathtaking. You also meet people from all over the world. What a great, great experience.

Yellowstone National Park,"I was expecting mild rainy weather but instead it was cold and with unexpected snow which made a beautiful park even more spectacular. The contrast between the snow and the meadows made for great photos and also made it easier to spot wildlife - wolves, grizzlies, mountain goats, big horn sheet, owls, osprey, black bear, elk and the ubiquitous bison with their young. I loved it. We saw most wildlife in the Lamar Valley with a sensational guide. Be prepared to get up early to get the best chance o sightings but it does seem that the animals are everywhere! Old Faithful is known world wide but in all honesty it's a bit of an anti-climax and it's really only because its eruptions can be predicted that we know about it. There are so many other areas of thermal activity which are more impressive because of the colour, the smell, the noise or just because they are eerie. It's such an alien landscape and worth visiting all the different areas. I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed camping in the snow. We stayed in cabins in West Yellowstone. You really need to spend at least 3-4 nights here in order to make the most of all the sights and have a chance to do some hiking. All the visitor centres, shops and restaurants were good providing lots of information and decent food.

It is like Glacier National Park with geysers added to it. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is one of my 5 favorite attractions in the National Park System. The scenic drive offers views of mountains, lakes, and rivers. I was blown away by Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful, and many other features. The Junior Ranger program is fantastic.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone National Park, has been one of my favorite places to visit for as long as I could remember and not once but twice in a 2 week span. My first visit was on April 20th and surprise it was free visitors day. On this visit was to see Old Faithful and it was an amazing sight to see. Old Faithful, goes off every 1hr-20mins. give or take 10 minutes. I stayed to watch it go off a second time. The park is amazing in its natural beauty and on my first trip the Bison were everywhere. These creatures are absolutely beautiful and I was amazed at how close people would get to the Bison to take photos with them. I myself stay far from them, not cause I was afraid; I just wanted to see them not interact with them. On this visit most of the park was still closed to through traffic so my visit was mainly of the geysers. A day spent in amazement. My second visit was on May 5th and most of the park was open. On this visit I first stopped off to see Old Faithful again (still beautiful) then I was off to see the Mammoth Hot Springs. While heading to the north part of the park, it was like being in a different park. Snow was everywhere unlike the south part of the park that is showing sights of green everywhere. Before, reaching the hot Springs I took a self detour to see if the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone was open, and it was. Absolutely majestic! I was at the upper rim (the lower rim was closed). I'm glad I took that self detour cause I really wanted to see the water fall in this Canyon.I did finally make it to the hot Springs of Mammoth but the water does not flow as it did in the past. But it was still something amazing to see. I have never seen that much limestone above ground. As for animals on my second visit Black Bear, Elk, and Bison.

Yellowstone National Park,"We had 2 days in the park in early spring before the crowds and loved every moment. The scenery here is ever changing and contrasting. From hot springs which bubble out of the ground surrounded by snow; to hot streams running down into the valleys and rivers; to mineral deposits and bacteria from the hot springs making wired and wonderful cascades, pools; geysers sprouting out the steam and boiling water; mud pools bubbling and churning continuously. The snow capped mountains were majestic and perfectly framed the park. The “Old Faithful Geyser” is a must see. It goes off around every 90 minutes and blows steam and water some 100 feet into the air for about 90 seconds each time. The park is well maintained everywhere you go and we loved the use of board walks around the attractions. These protected the environment and the tourists. Just as important was the animals and bird life living in the park. We sighted plenty of Elk, Deer, and Bison. Unfortunately, we didn’t see any bears, but were told they are out and about after their hibernation. Enough words, put this place on your must see list, it won’t disappoint.

Also if you are taking a motorcycle, you may not want to go early in May, some roads were icy.Depending on what you want to see, check out Yellowstone's website for when roads are opening and to plan your trip. Just by chance, we saw a show about Yellowstone on the Smithsonian channel before we left (which was very helpful). If you stop at alot of the points of interest, you will be doing alot of walking (we put on around 20000 steps) so have appropriate shoes/boots. Also depending on when you are going, pack appropriate attire-we brought winter clothing and hiking boots; glad we did, it was chilly when we were there. ","May 7, 2019",Lots to see,28,,4

The wind chill was so bad that we couldn't take any of the short trails that we would have wanted to. We saw a very limited number of animals, compared to a visit that we made later in May in another year. Much better to wait a few weeks if you can! We did see a few swans, pelicans, eagles, and elk, and quite a few buffalo. Scenic highlights available on this visit included the Mammoth Hot Springs area, and the road to Old Faithful with all of its geyser and hot pool activity. Also, if you are staying in West Yellowstone, be aware that maybe half of all restaurants in town are still closed limiting greatly your eating options.

Not sure if we got to see the whole park for it is gigantic. The thermal area was out of this world! We spent the day just in the thermal area and we got to see “Old Faithful” erupt 3 times. It erupts about every 1 1/2 hours. It was so cool to see so much wildlife. We saw a lot of bison and elk. They just walk along the road so close you could touch them. Just remember that the animals are wild and keep your distance. We were very fortunate to see a grey wolf up close. It was on the other side of a creek feeding on the dead antelope that it just killed. I think we did see all the wildlife in Yellowstone except for the grizzly bear and black bear.

Many visitiors gathered around Old Faithful to see the spraying. Then suddenly it let off its powerful hot water stream high up in to the sky, and everyone cheered with excitement.Yellowstone not only has geysers, but also has variety of wild animals. We have seen herds of bison dot on the ground, elks graze in the green fields, moose and deer wade through flowing streams.The more time you stay there, the more splendid of the great nature you can feel.

Walking along the Fountain Paint pits in -16F and having the steam form frozen droplets on eyelashes and hair as well as trees was stunning. Old Faithful eruption in the cold crisp air sans crowd was magical. Snowy faced bison added to the experience. I’ve lived in the desert Southwest for over 40 years so a real winter was a pleasant change. If you want and adventure, don’t mind cold weather, but crowds aren’t your thing, go in winter.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is a bucket list must for any nature or history lover.Tips:1) If possible, visit off season. Fewer crowds make the visit far less stressful and more enjoyable.2) get out early. If you wait until 9am to get out and about, you're dooming yourself to crowds. Parking will be difficult and the popular sites will be overcrowded. 3) Eating in Yellowstone is rediculously expensive. Hotels in the park DO NOT have fridges or microwaves, thereby forcing you into spending on overpriced concessions. If I could do it again, I would have seriously brought a mini fridge and microwave. Simply bringing a cooler won't cut it for a few days' stay. It would have saved me hundreds. Even groceries in the park are rediculously priced so pack in what you can. If you plan ahead and make a point of getting out early, you'll have a fantastic time. ","January 28, 2019",Off season vist well worth it. ,41,"Fort Collins, Colorado",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Everybody said Yellowstone is beautiful in summer. But you should visit in winter. You will find a different landscape. I thought there won’t be many visitors during winter, but surprisingly I couldn’t able to book my snowmobile tour because it was so busy during winter. Finally I spoke to Charlie from Yellowstonefun company and somehow he was able get a snowmobile for me through Three bear lodge. But the cache is you need to stay in three bear lodge. I was afraid initially how the lodge is going to be. Fortunately three bear lodge was good. After check in you had to collect the gear helmet, winter coat and face mask which are included in snowmobile tour package. I had a complimentary breakfast and we started around 9.A.M after a short trip instructions from our guide Dough. Dough was so nice and he explained everything about the park, animal, geysers and geography of park. We stopped at different places to look the animals and had lunch at old Faithful geyser. We drove around 65 to 70 miles and Finally came back to lodge before sunset around 4:30 P.M. I can say it’s life time experience and must visit the park in both seasons winter and summer.","January 12, 2019",Yellowstone in winter,2,,5
Yellowstone National Park,"Our trip only gave us a day and a half to roam the park, so we were only able to make it the length of the west side road, but we were in a constant state of amazement. I've grown up seeing pictures all my life, and they just don't compare to being there. There's so much more to see than gets talked about in articles and magazines. The diversity of the landscape is intriguing and stunning, we were in constant amazement of the views. We saw buffalo and some elk, but not much more wildlife for the area we were in, but seeing the majestic ones we did was pretty amazing. The geothermal features, of course were a highlight, and we were surprised at how many there are, how spread out all of it is, and how many different types there were.We were there just after the official travel season closed, so it wasn't quite as busy as the height of summer, but still busy enough that we had to make several passes in parking lots before finding open spots.Plenty of restrooms (vault toilets in most areas) throughout the area, although they were on the busy side with lines most times... best to not wait on a rest stop.We knew 2 days wasn't going to be enough time to really see the park, so we had already intended to make another trip. After being there and experiencing all the wonder - we will definately be back for a longer trip in the next few years. Can't wait!!!Also - don't miss the little side roads - they have some of the most amazing stops (even though you feel like you're stopping and starting constantly... totally worth it)","January 11, 2019",So Much to See and Experience,8,Lebanon,5

Most destination parking does fill up after 9am. With the many wildlife, don't forget to bring your camera, binoculars and even a scope. There are many pull offs, especially on Lamar and Hayden Valley for wildlife viewing. We saw a coyote, elk, deer and bison of course. The skies were a big hazy due to the wildfires in California. Great family vacation, highly on our bucket list and it was fun filled vacation. We are already planning our return in year or two. There were a few spots that were closed for renovation so hopefully these will be open once we return. But knowing there would be so much to see, we purchased a Yellowstone book prior to our trip and planned our agenda based on reviews and recommendations.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yelllowstone is a fantastic place. The nature, the landscapes, the colors, the wood covered hills, the geysers, the wildlife, the lakes and the canyons are all awesome and certainly worth five stars. However: the place is busy, and the main spots are crowdy, the parkings overflown. Yellowstone, as all the great spots on our planet, is victim of its success. As always in the National Parks, the trails are much less crowdy as soon as you leave the viewpoints. The main critique: park management. Three among the trail routes we had selected were closed. This costs at least one star - you cannot lure people from far away while closing the main attractions. Also : roadwork management. Three miles of roadwork caused major havoc on the main loop. For sure, roads must be maintained, but why not mitigate their nuisance by limiting the roadwork to a few hundred yards, moving it forward as the work progresses?Finally, the lodges and restaurants, at least at Canyon Village, are not worth the price you pay. See my review of Canyon Lodge and Cabins.So the upshot is: yes, this place is worth a trip even from Mars, but better management and facilities would make it far better, at no cost.","November 10, 2018",Fantastic but poorly managed.,60,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",4

Yellowstone National Park,"We started from Los Altos, California and went to San Jose Airport, From there we went to Bozeman airport, North America From the Airport my son hired a car. Then we proceeded for accommodation. Old Faithful Snow Lodge was booed by my son. It took about 5 hours to reach.Yellowstone is a National Park in USA. It spreads over three States - Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. Yellowstone National Park spans over an area of about 3500 square miles. This park encompasses lakes, canyons, rivers and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera.This is the largest super-volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage SiteThe park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features. There are plenty geysers. However, the Old Faithful geyser is the most popular and worth seeing. We heard that the geyser emits colour distinctly visible in late evening. At Yellowstone we (my wife, son, daughter in law and grandson) stayed in Old Faithful Snow Lodge. We went to view the coloured emissions at night 10.30 PM. The cold bite was intolerable. We saw lot of Bison in nearby areas. The canteen of the Old faithful Snow Lodge served an excellent menu prepared from meat of Bison.It has many types of ecosystems, but the forest is the most abundant. I came to know that Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11000 years. Apart from visits by mountaineers during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Literature In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.I was overwhelmed when I saw hot water in lakes and pieces ice were floating. What a nice peaceful coexistence of hot springs and ice,Mud boiling is another unbelievable place. As we reached, we got smell of Sulphur. Mud was truly boiling, Yellowstone Supervolcano could end the World, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans solution. NASA has already surveyed Yellowstone and proposed to use the Lava to produce electricity – an exemplary Geothermal means.I am reproducing a part of Presentation to school by my grandson Auhon Haldar, “What do you think is greatest danger to mankind? If you guess a ‘Super- Volcano’, then you are right. Right now NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is trying to stop the biggest super volcano on Earth. What’s the name, you may ask. To answer your question, the volcano is actually, ‘YELLOWSTONE’. While you may think Yellowstone is just a beautiful place in Wyoming full of geyser, hot springs, and mud sots, have you ever tried to think what made them. Everything in Yellowstone is actually water or mud superheated by magma (lava) in underground. If the temperature of magma gets to high then an eruption is inevitable. One of the possibilities is if the volcano erupts is a volcano winter and all the food reserves in the world will only last no more than 74 days. Fortunately NASA has come with a plan to stop the volcano from eruption and turn it to a geothermal electricity source. NASA plans to go the site of the volcano, drill hole into the rock and pump in water at a high pressure. When the water comes out, it will take away some heat like when you put water on hot stove it changes into temperature. The only ?? sides to this plan is the cost and the time. The cost is around $ 3.46 billion and believe it or not, it will take 100 to 1000 years to reduce the magma to cold rock.”I took numerous photos and video and attaching few of them.","October 17, 2018",Yellowstone – Beautiful but Dangerous,73,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",5

Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years. Aside from visits by mountain men such as John Colter and Jim Bridger during the early-to-mid 19th century, organized exploration did not begin util the late 1860s. Today, Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. From 2007 to 2016, an average of 3.5 million people visited the park annually. A record 4,257,177 visited in 2016. There are a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites. There are 1,100 miles of hiking trails. Fishing is a popular activity but a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters. There are 18 species of fish, including the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, which highly sought by anglers. Half of the world's geysers are in Yellowstone, fueled by the ongoing volanism. Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened. Yellowstone is the largest and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States with over 1,700 species of trees and other vascular plants that are native to the park. There are 60 species of mammals, including grizzly bears, black bears, elk, moose, bison, mule deer, mountain goat, coyote, timber wolf, bighorn sheep, cougar, pronghorn antelope and white-tailed deer. The Yellowstone bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. And there are 311 species of birds, including 26 pairs of nesting bald eagles that have been documented. To avoid battle fatigue, it is recommended that visitors schedule three days to see all of the attractions in the park at their leisure.","October 11, 2018","By the numbers, everything about Yellowstone is big--and beautiful",4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We spent three days driving throughout Yellowstone and visited virtually all the main areas and whilst we enjoyed ‘Old Faithful’ and a number of the other hot volcanic springs and geysers , we saw virtually no wildlife apart from some bison and deer a long way off in the distance.I know the main tourist facilities near ‘Old Faithful’ are always going to be busy but there was no excuse for the way we were treated by the staff in the food to go restaurant located behind the main gift shop, the selection of food and drinks available was very limited and the queue for ice creams was enormous but there was no need for them to be rude and curt with us while we were trying to order our food and drinks.We had a much better experience and saw lots more wildlife close-up at Custer State Park.","October 11, 2018",Disappointing.

A completely different landscape than the summer we brought our kids to see the park and Old Faithful.This time was more enjoyable than the summer about 30+ years ago.Not as crowdedI grew up in the foothills of the Smokies and I think the Smokies are the greatest place on earth to visit, especially in the fall when leaves are changing. But I got off track—- Yellowstone,Teton Park and the Tetons are beautiful creations of nature.

The view of the prismatic spring isn't as good as in the photos. The photos are from a drone, but this is still a must see. Also go to Mammoth Hot Springs, the sulfur pools, and the lower falls.

Yellowstone National Park,"There is a lot more to see in Yellowstone but my time was limited so this review is about the hydrothermal features only: Old Faithful and Grand Prismatic Spring are certainly highlights you don’t want to miss but take some time to see the other, less famous, geysers and hot springs as well, they are gorgeous! While Grand Prismatic Spring looks amazing on aerial views, is not that impressive when you stand right in front of it, you don’t really see a lot except the steam coming your way. The parking lot may be crowded, when cars are backed up all the way to the entrance I recommend parking along the road (where permitted) and take a 5 min walk, that’ll save you a lot of time. At Old Faithful I took the 1 h walk with a ranger which was very informative regarding the history of the park as well as the science behind the hydrothermal features. I arrived in the early afternoon, did Grand Prismatic Spring and Old Faithful first and then used the remaining daylight to see the nearby Black Sand and Biscuit Basin (Sapphira Pool is a highlight), including a walk from Biscuit Basin to Morning Glory, one of the most beautiful features in the area. I stayed at Old Faithful Lodge and spent the next morning (about 3h) walking around the rest of the geysers and springs between Old Faithful and Morning Glory (which has its name for a reason, it is even more beautiful in the morning sun). Some of my favorites were Grotto and Castle Geyser, Punch Bowl Spring and Crested Pool, and Beehive and Grand Geyser because I was lucky enough to see them both erupt.","October 6, 2018",Hydrothermal Features,34,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

There is so much beauty in the USA to share with the world. Yellowstone is one of the tops. Not, because it is a scenic place, but because of all of the natural wonders one can experience.Yes, the traditional natural beauty is there, with forests, mountains, lakes, and wildlife. But, the geological formations and oddities, such as the geysers, colourful hot springs and rock formations, makes the area unique. One can also find untouched wildlife habitats, so one should be careful not to disturb the larger animals, as they can be dangerous.We didn't have a lot of time, so we had to miss Old Faithful. There were only 2 or 3 times in a day for visitors to see that. We chose to spend the morning driving through the Grand Teton National Park. but during the few hours we did have, we chose to visit the Visitor Center and the West Thumb Geyser Basin. This site provided a scenic walkway among geysers and hot springs alongside scenic Yellowstone Lake. THAT place, with its eerie steam and cool colors, is worth the visit.Visitors should really plan to spend 4-5 days exploring the HUGE park, because there is so much to see and do.

Within 10 minutes into the park we seen a Biason on the side of the road near a cut out, turned around and drive within 25 feet to take pictures, nobody else around, it was a great start! We traveled through the park to see Old Faithful. There is an earlier set of springs, just know you can see it all if you have time so stop along the way all you want. We finally made it to Old Faithful and they post when it will approx go off. Walked around the shops until we felt it was close to time to head to see it. The crowds are thick when it goes off so if you need to sit down make sure you walk over early. They do have places to eat and get gas, also a mini grocery store since there are a few lodges close by for those who are staying overnight. We headed back after taking plenty of pictures, the avg speed is 35 in the park, lots of lookylues so be mindful.

GIven the road construction and what I know now, I’d go in the South Gate of Grand Teton National Park, drive north and out north gate, into South Gate of Yellowstone, go to Old Faithful and geyser basin and TURN AROUND and go back the way you came. Grand Teton is far more spectacular, we thought than any sight in Yellowstone other than Old Faithful. Go in the morning. We had a 25 minute wait to see Old Faithful erupt at 11:16 a.m. Traffic is lighter in the morning. NO cell service north of geyser basin (another reason to go no further north) and if you are in RV the campgrounds are first come, first served. This sucks and we think it’s a ploy to get folks to stay in the park longer. You have to stay at FCFS campsite after you get it, or risk loosing it. And to get a site you have to get to Campground by 11-1, depending on season. We won’t be back.

I encourage you to start planning earlier than 3 months IF you want to stay at any of the lodges within the park. They book up quickly. We did not stay within the park but had a perfectly wonderful time (and our wallets were a little more full because of that). We stayed in West Yellowstone and were able to see all the sites in West and North Yellowstone within 3 days time. We do not have young children so we traveled this past September and it was not crowded. Don't get me wrong, there was a crowd but not as bad as it would be during summer months.

You can see the highlights in one day along the loop road, but you do miss some of the sights that way, especially some of the overlooks on the side roads.

Reservations are also required well in advance to dine in any of the fancier lodge dining rooms. On our recent visit in September we found the roads easily passable (except for the one construction zone which had a 1/2 hour back-up).

""Regular"" gasoline in these towns is rated at 85 octane. Back home in NY, regular is rated at 87 octane which is what my car uses. I filled my tank without paying attention to the octane rating (just hit the regular button like I do back home) and my car began to ping under load a short time later. When I went to fill up my tank the next time, I noticed the 85 octane rating which explained the ping. Most stations offer an 88 octane which is their ""plus"" gasoline.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone in its size and animal sightings is amazing. I kept thinking back to when things were first discovered, and there were not massive amounts of people and, more specifically, cars. There is definitely a ""Disneyland"" aura to the whole experience. Nothing anyone can do about it.The positives: The sheer size of Yellowstone is hard to grasp, but astounding. The roads, albeit the massive construction going on, are in very good shape. Seeing the geysers was a highlight, particularly the one called White Paint (I think) which made me think of a cauldron of paint just boiling non-stop. I was mesmerized by this one. We did see a waterfall and ""heards"" of bison. We saw gaggles of geese (gaggles, right?) flying and also on the ground sounding their trumpets (honking). We saw elk groupings and lots of deer. Grand Prismatic Spring is a must see, but bear in mind you won't see it from above like you would in a National Geographic magazine. Just a note: Along one of our routes, we ran into a group of people getting ready to ride horses for seven days in the park. They told us a horse travels about 3 miles an hour and they ride for 2 hours a day. It was interesting to talk to the riders and watch them get matched up with their horses. They camp out every night. Not sure I could do this (in fact, I know I could not), but I was intrigued with those who were about to do it.Negatives: 1) The traffic at times, even thought not peak season, was terrible. Part was due to road construction, which I know cannot be helped, but having to sit for up to 1-2 hours without moving is grueling. (You have to respect that they are making improvements and the only time they can make improvements is ""x"" amount of months a year due to snow.) Words of wisdom: Anytime you see a restroom, use it! You never know when the next one will loom in the distance and you never know if you will get stuck for 1-2 hours due to construction or traffic. Personally, I thought there should be more restrooms sooner at the entrance on West Yellowstone side. 2) No one is supposed to get out of their car, but, guess what? People do!! It is not safe even if the animals appear docile. They could charge you at anytime. Because of the do-do's who get out, it makes for traffic jams. And, believe me, there are a lot of do-dos out there!Lastly, we spent 5 days in Yellowstone and that was more than enough. Probably 4 is enough, maybe even 3 if you get going early in the morning and spend all day.","September 29, 2018",Beautiful place if it just weren't for all the tourists and cars.,80,"Houston, Texas",4

The park had lines to get into every parking area and fight for a parking space and to see old faithful was a several hour excursion. If you can avoid going in July, do it as that was a bummer to have such long waits for every area. We saw many bison but only one moose (a guide said their population has greatly dwindled) and a few elk horns. We did expect to see more wildlife so it was a bit disappointing.

Yellowstone National Park,"I don't want anyone saying that I missed the point of a national park. Yellowstone is an excellent park, offering sights that no other park can offer. And it is so large that diversity is often overlooked because of the geothermal features. But ... a couple of ""heads up"" notes for those planning to travel to Yellowstone for the first time. One, wifi or internet access is extremely limited. Yes, I agree that you travel to the park for the natural setting and solitude. But admit it, we all have family to stay in touch with, careers that don't stop, projects that are ongoing. You will have to scout out access and maximize your productivity when available. A don't think that your cell (carrier dependent) will bail you out. There are just as few areas where you get reliable connections. Your best bet is to ask employees where they connect, and then go to that location. Finally, if you are a passport stamp collector be aware that Yellowstone has a bunch of different stamps at various locations. See all the visitor centers (warning, some only open seasonally, all close at 5:00) and some ranger stations to be able to say you saw all of Yellowstone. Not crucial obviously, but for those that keep track of such things. Besides, these are also the best places to learn about the park, get trail advice, find out about wildlife sightings, get an updated weather report, know where to get supplies and frequently enjoy displays and exhibits.","September 26, 2018","Excellent yes, but beware (wifi, cell phone, passport stamps).",155,Fort Atkinson,5

He knew where and why each species could be found.Kevin had the ability to know what each of us expect from this tour and did his best to satisfy our expectations. Anytime anyone thought they saw some animal he found a way to stop and look.WONDERFUL DAY AND WONDERFUL GUIDE!!!","September 26, 2018",Great Yellowstone Tour,4,"Bethany, Ok",5
Yellowstone National Park,"The entire park with all its geysers was incredible, and Old Faithful did not disappoint!! Through snow and wind, we watched it all! It’s an amazing sight, and one in which everyone should see.","September 26, 2018",Old Faithful is Amazing!!,31,"Clarksville, Tennessee",5
Yellowstone National Park,"This park is wonderful, exciting, awesome. There is no where else you could go to see what this park offers - animals, waterfalls, thermal features, horseback riding, fishing and just beautiful scenery. Lodges are just gorgeous. If you want something a little less formal there are cabins. You can tour the park on your own or they offer bus tours. Food is very good ranging from diner style to cafeterias to formal dining. People here are super helpful . Prices are reasonable. We have been coming back here every 3-4 years and just visited for the ninth time. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to experience our big beautiful country!!","September 26, 2018",National park,13,"Greenfield, New Hampshire",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is all its cracked up to be, only for real. We sent four days in Yellowstone staying at Lake Lodge (that wasn’t the good part). Around every bend there was a new sight to astound; animals, scenery, geology.Travel: There is a long distance between each town/ sight and on the whole everyone is travelling at 40mph looking at the scenery. Allow plenty of time between stops and allow for intermittent stops to look at a waterfall or passing bison. And if you see a crowd of cars stopped at the side of the road, stop also, you may see something wonderful. Geology: Old Faithful & the many other geysers and mud pools are fantastic. They are scattered around the south-west half of the park and worth a wander. Don’t just see Old Faithful, there are plenty of others on the nearby walk or at different spots. Scenery: Everywhere you go there will be wonderful things to see. Just drive safely and allow your passenger to do the looking. Animals: There are animals all over (notably north-east) so drive slowly. They have right of way on the roads and they know it, often just wandering across or along the road. You may particularly want to visit Lamar Valley for bison in herds. It is often best to go animal spotting at dawn and dusk. Towns: Mammoth was the favourite. Excellent visitors centre, great hot-spring, many elk (dawn & dusk) and an interesting little mail-hut from 100yr ago. If you have a cozzy with you visit the boiling river (1 mile out of town) for a natural jacuzzi (& yes, it really is boiling). Old Faithful feels like the centre of tourist activities. Lake area has a nice view of the lake but otherwise limited facilities. Canyon Village has helpful staff in the gas station.Catering: All the food and drink, in all the shops and cafeteria is supplied by the same company (and it really is poor quality food).My tips: Get up early. Dress in layers for hot days and cool evenings. Pack food that will last so you don’t have to always eat in the cafeteria. Bring good binoculars and a super long lens for your camera. Bring a refillable water bottle (there are lots of refil stations).ENJOY!","September 26, 2018",Wonderful experience,45,"London, United Kingdom",5

There are plenty of places to get out and walk around and everything is worth taking a picture of.

Yellowstone National Park,This is a beautiful place to visit. We spent four days here and saw so many animals. The animals are all in their own natural habitat. You have to wait for the bison to cross the road or any other animal. The rangers are great! They are so nice and full of information. The speed limit is low on purpose and some people did not follow it. It makes unsafe for the people and the animals. They geysers were very interesting!

Old Faithful, Geyser Basins, Yellowstone Lake, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Mammoth Hot Springs, etc. - each area of Yellowstone is just very interesting and beautiful. There are so many geological wonders and so much wildlife in one place. It is large, so allow several days. We stayed in two different areas of the Park in order to see everything without having to drive a lot.

Try to stay in the park hotels if possible, the option of seeing geysers, animals, etc early in the morning and later afternoon and evening is worth the cost. Make sure you get reservations early! Months early.Do your research and see what areas offer what you want and every season offers new sights. Enjoy your visit.","September 22, 2018",My favorite national park,18,"Liberty, Missouri",5
Yellowstone National Park,"My husband and I spent three days at Yellowstone National Park and Grand Tetons. It was really pretty and we took a lot of pictures. The wildlife we saw was coyote, buffalo, elk, antelope, deer, and black bears. There was a little road work at Yellowstone at the East entrance and another place. The views are spectacular. We went 09/10-09/12 and there wasn't too many people at both places. The weather was very nice, not too hot and didn't rain.

I had never been to Yellowstone, but my wife had been there back in the 60's as a child. Even though she had tried to tell me how beautiful it was, I was not ready for the splendor and majesty everywhere you go. From the abundant wildlife to the scenic views, you will leave understanding just how magical nature can be. We visited in September and found no waiting lines and easy to get around. The temps were very nice and if you can plan a trip in September, I would highly recommend doing so to get away from the crowds. This should be on everyone's bucket list in their lifetime.

Yellowstone National Park,Just finished at least our 10th trip to this fantastic national park. Saw tons of wildlife and did some great hiking. September is kind of crowded on the roads but you only have to park the car and take a short hike to literally get away from it all. The park now makes bear spray rentals available by the day or week which is much more economical than buying spray you have to leave behind if flying.

However some things really stand out to me.My wife and I love camping and this is an excellent place to do so. Only problem was this was the first time that we had heard wolves out in nature, howling at the moon. We didn't sleep that night. It was super stereo! Loved it!!You also have to tour Hayden Valley. It is where the bison roam and every other type of animal. At times you will see people in small groups about half a mile or so from their cars. Don't join them. They are probably watching Grizzly bears and they will attack on a heart beat for no reason.Go there, be safe and enjoy!!!","September 18, 2018",Beyond my expectations!!,48,"Erie, Michigan",5

Yellowstone National Park,"I visited the park 60 years ago...can’t remember that trip, but we won’t forget this one. We spent 3.5 days and saw many of the sights. I’m convinced you could spend a month there and not see nearly all of it. Wildlife and geothermal sites held our focus. We saw most of the critters except for the wolves and moose. Lucky to travel immediately after Labor Day so the place was not crowded. The only big site we didn’t see (long wait to get in) was Grand Prismatic Spring area. Everything else was just a breeze. Did not stay in the park...stayed about 20 miles outside of the north entrance. Count on extra drive times. This place is huge with lots of stops. Hint: Do not get caught in the southern part of Yellowstone at dusk when your hotter is outside the north gate. After dark driving in Yellowstone is not a good experience. Also, get the NPS senior pass. I got mine when it was $10. More expensive now but park admission is pricey.","September 18, 2018",Bucket list check off,82,"Springfield, Missouri",5

The roads may be closed in some areas if you come too early in the year. Spring is best when you want see baby animals. It may be warm in Jackson Hole, but there’s snow in Yellowstone.Don’t speed in the Park!!!!

There are walkways to move around the areas with thermal activity. For me --- hard to believe until I saw it up close, first hand. We saw over 100 Buffalo, some close, 50 elk, with the bulls bulging, chasing cows. Of course we saw Old Faithful, Yellowstone lake and much more. One must be careful with the traffic.

Yellowstone National Park,"This is one of the National Parks that we have wanted to visit for a long time. It is a very nice park. We were there at the beginning of September and really didn’t encounter much traffic to speak of. The only real traffic jams were a couple of crowded parking lots and 2 places where they were doing road construction. I would rate this park under The Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, Brice National Park and Arches National Park. We were here for 2 days and were able to cover both loops without feeling rushed. We didn’t stay in the park because it is so expensive. We were able to find rooms at towns just outside the park often less than $200/night.

Yellowstone National Park,"My husband and I regret taking the boat tour. It was about $18/person which would have been fine had the tour been as expected. First, and this might not be typical, but staff was late by almost 30 minutes getting started and our tour was the first of the morning. We had a lot to fit in that day, so we were a little aggravated, as were most other people on the tour. 2nd, it was too crowded for the seating arrangement. They put 3 to a bench seat in almost every row. The stranger next to my husband definitely needed more space, so we were totally uncomfortable the entire trip. My back and shoulder were killing me by the end from being squished against the window. I would have rather paid a little extra to be more comfortable. Our situation was not unique . 3rd, the ranger spoke absolutely nothing about the volcanic activity in the lake, or how to recognize hot spots on the lake. That was really shocking. She spoke about the history of the hotels and other buildings mostly as the boat driver passed structures facing the lake. That would have been a little more acceptable had the boat turned so everyone had a chance to view the buildings she was referencing from both sides of the boat. We couldn’t see half of what she was talking about from our side. The ranger was knowledgeable, but we regretted wasting valuable time on it, and I would never recommend anyone take this tour.","September 14, 2018",Boat Tour of Yellowstone Lake NOT Worth It.,25,"Gallatin, Tennessee",3

There was a sign warning of a 30 minute delay but did not explain so we figured it was due to heavy traffic in the summer months but we are here in September. Turned out it was road construction the entire length of that road. Traffic was only one way at a time leading to huge back ups.

Staying at the park, allows you to avoid the crows, specially in early morning and late night. We saw the old faithful geyser erupt in a full moon night, was awesome!!Lost of wildlife!! To see bison, bears and wolves:Lamar Valley and Hayden valley and deer,moose,chipmunk, we saw a lot in any of the others areas in the park.The Geysers basin are amazing too; great to take the hike to observation point,has a great view of the upper geyser basin and the old faithful, and fairy falls near the grand prismatic geyser. If you don´ t like crows, just do some of the many hikes that this park has to offer.Up to Canyon village to Tower-Roosevelt; the scenery change completely, the grand canyon of the Yellowstone river is a must, great hikes here too as in the area of the Roosvelt lodge.Finally we end up leaving the park trough the north gate, enjoying Mammoth Springs ( lovely specially when the sun come down) , the fort and the iconic gate.We really enjoy almost all the park has to offer!

If you know where these generally are on the map, you will make better use of your time in the park. And if you are driving yourself, try the Gypsy Guide App. It will talk to you as you drive through the park, no matter where you are and where you start. It tells you what is coming up and if it is a MUST SEE or not. This was a wonderful app and helped us make great use of our time there.

Yellowstone National Park,"What can you say about a National Park the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined? This park is filled with a wide range of natural wonders and wildlife - something amazing around every corner. We mainly stuck to the main Figure-8 through the park since we only had one full day to visit - this time. Saw the must-see sights, like Old Faithful - but also took some of the boardwalk tours around other interesting features. By sheer dumb luck, we walked up on the Beehive Geyser on the Upper Geyser Basin Tour just as it was preparing to erupt, which it only does once or twice a day. A wind shift gave us a shower, but the same wind and sunshine dried us off in time for the Old Faithful eruption. Saw many beautiful vistas, a few water falls and an assortment of wildlife. A LOT of driving - as I said, this park is huge - but it can be done in a day (even with stops and short side-trips) if that's all you have (at least at times the crowds aren't extreme). Be prepared for all kinds of weather - it snowed the next day here. We did not have too many wildlife slow-downs, which can also affect your travels through the park. Be sure to consider one of the National Park passes if you are going to visit multiple parks - it saved us money. Wi-Fi is available in specified areas, bathrooms are scattered about the park and the prices at the various stores did not seem too out of line.

Yellowstone National Park,"This is a National Park that has something for everyone. The Lower Falls itself might not be that impressive, but its presence accentuates the yellow stone of the grand canyon. Then there is the Old Faithful, not the tallest or the most beautiful in the park, but it erupts at a regular predictable fashion guaranteeing that you will see at least one erupting geyser. The thermal pools with the deep rich colors caused by the bacteria are also quite photogenic. The downside is the crowd during the summer months making it difficult to find parking space sometimes at popular destinatioins. Also, the weather can get quite chilly even in August. Whe I was there in late August, there was a hail storm and the temperature dropped to the low 30's in the early morning.

Yellowstone National Park,Visited this park on a very warm August day! Came in through the north and left on the east travelling numerous miles in between! There was some construction which slowed our trip a little. You have to spend at least a whole day to enjoy it all.

Yellowstone National Park,Visiting Yellowstone was an amazing experience! There are so many sights to see and they are all very different. The geology of the park is incredibly interesting. We stayed in the park for four days at the end of August and it was enough time for us to see 90% of the park. My favorite was the Grand Canyon. I believe you must make it to Yellowstone at least once in your life to experience all it has to offer.,"September 3, 2018",Amazing Place,9,"Milford, Pennsylvania",5

Yellowstone National Park,I totally enjoyed this stay. 3 nights were good for us. First day did a hike with Wildland Trekking (Mystic Loop) and when we got back we grabbed a cocktail and watched old faithful erupt. Day 2 we drove around the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone (not to be missed) and hiked down the Lower Falls (paved) short hike. Day 3 we took an 8:30A education tour with the ranger at the Visitor's Center and learned about the geysers and eco system of the park starting with Old Faithful. It was so interesting and enjoyable.,"September 3, 2018",Book a year ahead and stay at the Old Faithful Inn (if you can),0,,5
Yellowstone National Park,There is no other place in the world where you will see such diversity of nature.

Yellowstone National Park,"Sure, Yellowstone has volcanic activity which other parks do not. However, other parks have far superior scenery overall (like Bryce Canyon or Arches NP). The volcanic uniqueness of Yellowstone is not spectacular. Most are fairly passive small holes in the ground with bubbling water or mud. A few ponds are a pretty mineral green or light blue, but they are very small. The various attractions are seperated by LONG distances within the park & are situated deep within the large park. You will do a lot of driving through mostly unrewarding scenery to see the various volcanic sites. Old Faithful (see our seperate review) is worth seeing, but most of the others are relatively inactive & not worth the driving.","September 2, 2018",Average compared to other US National Parks,877,"Sydney, Australia",3
Yellowstone National Park,"If you love natioanl parks, you must visit the first national park in the US. There's something for everyone. We went for 4 days With the large geothermal area, there are so many geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles to see. Spectacular river views, greenery, wildlife galore (we saw many bison, elk, pronghorn, mule deers).We stayed at gardiner outside the north entrance for 2 days. There seemed to be less traffic leaving the park that way. We saw the most wildlife in Lamar valley. We drove the entire figure 8 over the 4 days and saw pretty much everything. We did 2 off road hikes: Fairy Falls (easy) and Bunsen peak (difficult). Both were enjoyable and took about 3 to 3.5 hours each.The worst thing about the park is the traffic. Even though you aren't supposed to stop in the road and take pics, people do it. Took us 30 minutes longer both nights we stayed outside of the West entrance to get out because there were a couple of elk grazing by the road. Be prepared for high prices in and out of the park for food. All in all, it is a spectacular park. ","September 2, 2018",Once in a lifetime,34,"Louisville, Kentucky",5

We recommend entering from the Northeast entrance which brings you through majestic Beartooth Pass in Montana/Wyoming. It was the first time we had ever been, and it lived up to its billing. Great place to take the family. Park Rangers very helpful and knowledgeable. It was a bucket list destination. $35 got you admission for seven days, to a place it may take that long to see everything. We only were able to stay 2 full days.

Yellowstone National Park,"It's a huge park, containing different geological features, the most famous and attractive one is it's geothermal features (half of the world's geothermal features are situated in the Yellowstone park), the Grand Prismatic spring is astonishing. There are hundreds of geysers, you can see some of the eruptions, e.g. the Clepsydra geyser, in the Fountain paint pot area, is always erupting, and the height is comparable to the Old faithful geyser. There are prediction on some of the geyser eruption time, you can check it either in the visitor center or on the official website of the Yellowstone National park. Besides, the geothermal features, there are waterfalls and canyon on the east side, you can do lots of hiking, of course with different level, you can choose the one suitable for you. In order to take a look to different area of the park, you need to spend at least 3 full days, for me, one day in the Mammoth hot spring and Norris basin, with some points to stop along the way, and nearby, one day for the upper, middle and lowr geyser basin, one day for the canyon region, also the Tower fall, the mud pot and the West thumb geyser, and stop by along the way if there is any attraction points. we arrived at the park at about 8am, then leave at about 8 or even 9pm. As it was in mid-July, the day time is long, the sunset time is over 9pm, so it's fine, and we are lucky to book the accommodation just near the West entrance, so with a few minutes, we can drive from hotel to the park. of course you can stay inside the park, but may be much more expensive. Although we can do it in 3 full days, I realize that if having an extra day, it would be better, in case if you have any point can't reach due to weather problem, you can have second chance to visit it again, (as it's in mountain region, the weather can change suddenly, it would be sunny in the first half day, then suddenly it become very windy and rains in the afternoon,). And you can have some time to ""wait"" for geyser eruption if the schedule is not so tight as ours. Of course people can spend a week there, do different types of hiking or wait for some animal to appear. This park is also famous for it's wild life, for me, this is not my target, however, you can not be avoided to see some even you are not targeting on seeing them, the elk is everywhere near the post office of the Mammoth hot spring, there is a site near the Madison river, also can see them, for bison, we see them for several times, even see them crossing the road which cause some traffic jam, because people need to wait for them to cross the road before the car can move. I also see a bear, but it's quite far in the forest, so can't see clearly nor take a clear picture. I also see a fox. The park is rich in both geological features and the wildlife, much more things to see than in Grand canyon (Arizona), so worthwhile to go at least one time in your life, of course you can go more, people said everytime you go, the geothermal features would be different each time.some hot spring is active this time, may be dormant next time and vice versa, so the nearby environment will change accordingly, and the color of the pool would also change due to the temperature change, it's dynamic. For details of each part of the park, you can see my comments on each of the attractions.","August 29, 2018",One of the most worthy to go attraction is USA,141,United States,5

We stayed 5 nights at Grant Village Campground and we were there only to sleep. The park has many wonderful attractions like Old Faithful and other geysers, Grand Prismatic Springs, the lake, and the wildlife which we were able to observe everywhere such as elk, bison, bear, pine marten, coyote. It does take time to drive from one place to the next, but it is well-worth the trip. The biggest hurdle for us during the week was to get to Mammoth Springs because of it's proximity to our campground and the road construction. However, it was so pleasurable once we arrived. Just make sure to fill up on gas when you head out there and give yourself at least 2 1/2 hours to make it through traffic. Finding parking can also be a pain, but remain patient.

Yellowstone National Park,"We really enjoyed Yellowstone with all the Geysers and smelly bubbles. Its a very unique area of the world and no wonder its a national park. The big disappointment was the lack of animals like Elk, deer, Grizzlies and other wildlife. There is lots of Bison and they seem to do well in Yellowstone but apparently if they drift out of the park they are shot by farmers in Montana, South Dakota and Idaho. Still a great place to go. The private company running the place does a disservice and is not honest about the attractions you could go and see. When you ask the desk for help they avoid telling you places to go or they don't fully inform you. The construction all the way to Mammoth was some how missed and was not reported--many folks i spoke will never forget this as it was a horrendous adventure to get to Mammoth.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone had been on my bucket list for years!! My husband and I spent 3 full days in YS, but wish we would of had one more full day. We entered from the east just north of Cody. We took Hwy 120 that connects onto 296 (Chief Joseph Scenic Hwy). Great Scenic way to enter and catch the norther part of YS. We did the full Grand Loop. So so many stops. So many things to enjoy. We had to head toward Montana (Cooke City Silver Gate) to pick up the Gaper Guide I had reserved. HIGHLY recommend this, many pick up/drop off locations. From there we re entered YS and went toward Mammoth Hot Springs. That city beautiful & the massive geysers are amazing. Do them if you can. Lots of stairs on one, but so with it. We then continued south & worked our way to our hotel north of Yellowstone Lake with stood along the way. The lodges are expensive, but it’s all about the location & easy access to sights. Day 2 & 3 we continued to explore different areas. Taking in as much as we could. The Gaper Guide helps let you know where points of interest are, information about things you are seeing, history & so much information. It follows you by GPS. Gotta remember there is No Wi-Fi at all in the parks. We were going to stay in W. YS but I didn’t want to waste 2 hours driving in & out of YS. Kinda wish I would have done a night in Old Faithful area as we had to back track from Jackson Hole one day. I really did Not expect to take so long in YS. There really is just so much to see & do.

Yellowstone National Park,"I can’t believe I waited until my 60th year to visit. My recommendation is the you spend two days and stay in the park. When calculating times to get between features, double the amount of time you think it will take. The highest speed limits in the park are 45 mph but traffic often moves more slowly. Work your way through the the Grand Loop and see everything. Be sure to keep your eyes open for wildlife. We thought food in the park was pretty good both at the finer dining venues and the diners. There are lots of general stores where you can buy souvenirs and tee shirts. Everyone on the plane home had on their Yellowstone gear. I thought the items in the stores were fairly priced. Finally, I had been concerned about crowds. During the third week of August crowds were not that bad.

Yellowstone National Park,"Wow! Amazing! As a biased Californian, I still prefer Yosemite for its even more stunning vistas (how can you compete with El Capitan or the Sequoia trees?), but Yellowstone more than holds its own for other reasons while claiming its rightful title as The Original National Park. For starters, it is much easier to travel around by car than in Yosemite, and traffic and parking are never a true nuisance despite the many visitors.The main attractions are really centered around the abundance of opportunities to encounter wildlife (Bison, elk, deer, bears, etc.) and marvel at the volcanic activity (YNP has 2/3 of the Earth's geysers!). Reminder: heed the constant advice of the park rangers regarding safety when encountering wild animals!I would spend at least 3 full days inside YNP. There are many places to stay INSIDE the park but I recommend booking at least 12-13 months in advance to get the lodging you desire. The main roads and many major attractions are arranged in a figure of eight configuration with the Yellowstone Grand Canyon and Canyon Lodges (newest, and built within the last 2 years) nearest to the center. From there, you can venture out on day trips by car during the day to visit some of the more enjoyable attractions and their attached visitor centers, and do some hikes. For example: Grand Canyon of Yellowstone (including Lower and Upper Falls of Yellowstone River), Old Faithful, Midway Geyser Basin (Grand Prismatic Spring), Norris Geyser Basin (Steamboat Geyser), Mammoth Hot Springs (Yellowstone Fort), Lamar or Hayden Valleys (Bison herds), Yellowstone Lake, Roosevelt Lodge, etc.Mammoth Springs is where the historic park headquarters are at Fort Yellowstone. Be sure to learn about the intriguing history of YNP and how the National Park system was founded. TIP: The only FREE WiFi we found in the whole park was at the Fort Yellowstone visitor center. Cellular service is awful throughout the park. If you are frugal and don't want to pay for WiFi, and you are on AT&T or T-mobile, your best bet for checking email on your smartphone maybe (seriously) somewhere in the hills on the Grand Loop Rd between Canyon Lodge and Tower Falls. As I mentioned above, investigate and book your lodging well in advance. We chose the newest and very good rooms at the Canyon Lodge. A lot of work is going on now to update the many facilities but older hotels, lodges and cabins are still not always as comfortable, and may not even have private bathrooms- so do your research carefully before booking.Someone gave me advice to move and stay at different lodges throughout the park to reduce driving between attractions- I feel that this unnecessary because the reasonable drives truly allow you to enjoy the scenery and wildlife. Plus, why would you want to unpack/pack, check in/out and move around several times during your stay in YNP?Food is reasonably priced throughout the park, but you can still save some $ by filling your canteens for free at the many filing stations (or bringing your own bottled water), and making your own breakfast and bag lunches from supplies you buy before entering the park.","August 20, 2018",Visit at least once in a lifetime!,21,"Los Angeles, California",5

Forget trying to call an ambulance, you will never get one because only a few spots have any signal. ","August 19, 2018",One of the best parks in the country ,144,"Oviedo, Florida",4
Yellowstone National Park,Without question one of the most diverse national parks. From geysers to hot springs to canyons the landscape so stunning words don’t do it justice.Most national parks require hiking and backcountry trips to “fully enjoy”. I’m not a camper or hiker so Yellowstone was perfect for us. Park the car ...and see everything from accessible overlooks. I know that sounds boring and a cop out to some but it’s what works for us “older” park visitors ,"August 19, 2018",So good I’m hoping to return ,100,"Ocean City, Maryland",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is my favorite national park of the 25 I've been to. The park has erupting geysers, cascading mountains, colorful lakes, and amazing wildlife. Yellowstone has some of the best wildlife in the National Park Service. I saw bison, black bear and cubs, grizzly bears, elk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, osprey, a marmot, and a bighorn sheep. There are thousands of miles of hiking trails. Many are adventurous, but there are plenty of family hikes all around the park. While a lot of driving is needed to travel around the park, these drives are beautiful and make for great wildlife viewing. I went in July, the most crowded time of year, but there was very little traffic. The park has many activities too. Some include hiking, biking, horseback riding, whitewater, fishing, mountain climbing, winter sports, wildlife viewing, camping, and the best photography in the country. I don't understand why people call this place ""overrated"". It deserves all of the credit it gets and more. The park is fantastic all year round.","August 19, 2018",This Park Has it All,0,,5

Yellowstone National Park,"Very simply, this is an example of what Ken Burns described as ""America's Best Idea."" Yellowstone is a singular natural and educational classroom and laboratory. There are many resources that can be used to research Yellowstone to prepare for your visit. I would simply recommend using or reading one of those resources in order to enhance the experience. And to remember that Yellowstone is not a zoo. If one can afford it, I would also recommend using the Yellowstone Forever organization as a guide for your visit. They are a non-profit educational adjunct to the National Park Service. But a totally separate entity from the National Park Service. But if you can use them, your experience, as ours was, will be much enhanced.","August 17, 2018",The First National Park,47,Maryland,5

Yellowstone National Park,"Our very special trip (for my big birthday) far exceeded our expectations. The whole trip was excellent - we stayed in the park for eight nights. Every ranger we met was helpful and informative, and with their help we planned many trail walks, and explored the back country. The trails were our favourite part of our trip as we got away from both car and crowds. The animals were amazing - we saw hundreds of bison and elk, some pronghorn, a coyote and a couple of bears (get bear spray!). Sometimes the crowds got to us - particularly at Canyon Village and the Grand Canyon Trails, but usually we were able to avoid the hordes of people by walking in wilderness. Early starts gave us our best days, and we were proud to be at Old Faithful by 0815. We stayed in two locations - Mammoth Hotel and Lake Lodge and Cabins, so we were able to access the whole park. Best bits are hard to choose but Lamar Valley was amazing. We drove out to the North East Entrance - fab. A boat trip on the Lake from Bridge was strange (Health and Safety overload!).

We did all of our hikes off the main paths and it was so peaceful and the real way to see the park. We saw plenty of bisons, elks, and antelopes through various parts of the park.

Yellowstone National Park,"This is a fabulously beautiful park and our reviews of the different places we visited reflect this.However, it could be so much more pleasurable. We’re not going to moan about the traffic. If you visit a popular destination during the summer holiday season, guess what, you won’t be alone. The issues are with how the park is run, by the government (rangers) and by the company that has the monopoly for food and drink (Xanterra).There is little of no wi-fi/cell reception in the park. You don’t expect this when you’re in the wilds so if you’re stuck in bison jam, hard luck. But this is 2018 so we did think there might be some reception in the many general stores, visitor centres, lodges and hotels but there was none. Earlier on our road trip we stayed on a ranch in the middle of nowhere but they had wi-fi because the owners had made the effort, spent the money so their guests could enjoy some communication. Too often the signs by the road were either non-existent, useless or too late, you’d gone past with another car 2 yards behind you. It won’t be controversial to say that there’s a dearth of decent places to eat with enough capacity. Open a few more! On the roads driving etiquette went out of the window. Too many people seemed to be in a hurry so that if you obeyed the speed limit or drove below it they hooted you or overtook dangerously. Even worse, so many just ignore signs saying don’t park or stop and they do both, sometimes sticking out so that traffic backs up behind them. The first time you see a lone bison or elk in the distance is very exciting but don’t shudder to a halt – you’ll see loads before your time is up.We never once saw rangers telling these people off or moving them on. In fact we hardly saw rangers out and about, only at the attractions and visitor centres. We were in the park 12 to 16 June when the temperature was great, everything was open but it wasn’t ridiculously busy. So, go in early, stay late and, with a couple of exceptions, don’t expect to eat anything decent. Get a good map (e.g. National Geographic201) and drive or walk off the beaten track. Then you’ll enjoy it, and if someone says “when you’ve seen one geyser, you’ve seen them all” they haven’t been to Yellowstone National Park","August 10, 2018",Once In A Lifetime Only,206,"Manchester, United Kingdom",3

Yellowstone National Park,"One of the highlights of our cross country vacation adventure was that I was finally going to see Yellowstone. Once our trip was booked, my excitement grew. Then, I got there... When we arrived, we went directly to our campground. Set up and went on our way to see the wonders of Yellowstone. It was immediately evident that this may have been a giant mistake. For starters, the traffic is insane. When broken down by hours, we spent more time sitting in traffic than actually enjoying the park. Another visitor I was having a conversation with told me they don’t limit the number of people let into the park every day. This would certainly explain the problem. It’s just flooded with people. Make sure you have a full tank of gas because you’re going to burn it up in traffic.Trying to find parking is nearly impossible. One has to be determined to see a specific site because lack of parking is an excellent deterrent. Let’s see... the wildlife. I’ve heard my whole life about Yellowstone’s wildlife. Couldn’t wait to experience it. And... I’m still waiting. On our first day we saw some bison. On day two we saw elk on some grass in a town square. No other wildlife to be found. Even off the beaten paths. What a disappointment. You know people are desperate to see some kind of wildlife when there’s a 2 hour traffic jam because someone saw a black dot way up on a hill and thought it was a bear. Smh. I see more wildlife in my back yard. Literally. I live against state game lands. In fact, when I got home and pulled in my driveway, there were deer on my lawn. My sister said “look, you have more wildlife in your yard than Yellowstone has in the whole park”A shame. Another issue was the tourists themselves. I know this isn’t the parks fault but it is what you’ll encounter while there. In all my travels, I have NEVER seen such rude and ignorant people in all of my life! They will literally push you out of the way. I saw a couple of arguments because of this. Want to take a drive and just enjoy the views? Not happening. Even when there isn’t traffic and you’re going the speed limit, people will ride your bumper and honk at you. At every stop I saw disrespect to the park itself. Touching things they aren’t supposed to, litter, etc. Even with the bison we saw on our first day. People were walking up to them and calling them. Total lunacy and ignorance! These people aren’t there to soak up the atmosphere. I don’t know why they are there but it ruins it for those of us who want to have an actual Yellowstone experience. I’m just still in awe at the rudeness I witnessed. Boggles my mind. I won’t be back to Yellowstone. Never thought I’d say that but it’s the truth. If it wasn’t for the amazing features I got to see, I would have given the park 1 star. ","August 6, 2018",Amazing place but I wouldn’t come back,20,"Albrightsville, Pennsylvania",3

Yellowstone National Park,"Ever since my dad got his lifetime senior pass on a trip up to Haleakala in Mau`i, he has been on a mission to finally see many of the national parks like Grand Canyon, Saguaro, Yosemite twice, and this year, Yellowstone, one of the most if not the most popular national park we have. We had limited time so we decided to skip Grand Teton and save both days for Yellowstone. To see it in one day unfortunately is not seeing it at all. This requires a minimum two day in order to really appreciate most of what Yellowstone has to offer. We decided to do the lower loop the first day and the upper loop the second. Since we were staying in Idaho, we entered through the West Gate and headed straight for Grand Prismatic spring for our first stop. Along the way, there were quite a bit of slowdown not necessarily due to large summer crowds, thankfully but people slowing down and stopping to see the bison along the way, some as close as right next to the road. Although at times you may be seeing them quite close from your car, please exercise caution and not approach them on foot but keep the recommended 25 yard distance especially if you are there when they have their babies with them which causes them to be even more protective. Grand Prismatic is an easy walk on paved roads and again, stay within the marked path and hold onto your hats as once it falls outside of the marked area, no chance of recovery. Colors were quite impressive even if it is because of bacteria. The next stop is Old Faithful Geyser and Old Faithful Inn, a National Historic Landmark itself and worth a stop. You can find out the estimate for the next eruption here and seeing the eruption of Old Faithful from this side is much less crowded as well making it a win-win strategy. The Old Faithful Basin store just a quick minute or two drive is a great place to stop for lunch even if service is a little slow due to having only one grill. After lunch, we headed to Yellowstone Lake which is probably the quietest part of the park but pictures no less impressive as the largest high elevation lake in North America. Our last stop before heading out is the Lower Yellowstone River Falls and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone with a quick sighting of a brown bear along the way. Mosquitos are out in full force here so bug repellent is recommended. Although the upper loop Day 2 had less stops, we still ended up driving a lot especially trying to get to Lamar Valley. By the time we got to the road leading to the valley, it was already time for lunch so we stopped at Roosevelt Lodge. After lunch, we headed out and was almost immediately treated to sightings of the sheep. Then it was miles after miles of bison in the valley, along the road, and crossing the road. The only thing that could make it better was a black bear sighting in the far distance up a hill. Although Mammoth Hot Springs is completely doable afterwards, we decided to skip it so we can squeeze in another dinner at Copper Rill that night. There were two areas of big traffic jam leaving the park which we later discover was due to bison crossing, another reminder that this is their home and we are only visiting.","August 3, 2018",Need 2 Days Minimum,39,California,5

Yellowstone National Park,"My husband and I were super excited to visit Yellowstone. We knew it would be busy, given that it was July, but we were okay with that. We stayed in the park at the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, though we would stay somewhere else if we ever came back just because it was far from a lot of the stuff we liked doing.However, we probably won’t have to worry about returning because it just was not for us. I’m telling you, Yellowstone must house half of the world’s population on any given afternoon in the summer. We took to waking up every day at 4:30 AM to do some sightseeing, hiding out in our hotel room from noon until dinner, and then going back out...if we even dared. So many people, so much traffic, so many inconsiderate tourists.If cell service is your thing, you won’t really have it. Even where LTE is available in the park, it is absolutely overloaded. We were only able to use data before 6 AM and after about 9:30 PM, otherwise it was an exercise in futility. According to the staff at the Snow Lodge, purchasing wifi is not worth it, as they admitted it’s pretty lousy throughout the park. Just something to know before going in case it’s important to you.Yellowstone is beautiful, though I have to say, with the exceptions of the geysers, it reminded us a lot of the White Mountains of NH. For us, that’s a much easier and much more enjoyable place. The crowds at Yellowstone really put a damper on things around there, unfortunately...and I have to say, for as eco-friendly as they purport to be, they’ll allow hundreds of RVs, trucks, buses, and cars in every day as long as you’re paying for it, environment be darned. Wildlife was abundant and pretty awesome to see. We saw bears, antelope, and of course the ubiquitous bison and elk. Watch out for bison jams, they can be a real drag! Then again, it is their home.","August 2, 2018",I’ll Go to New Hampshire Next Time...,62,"East Coast, US",3

But not this time. We made it and it was great! Spent two days cruising around the park seeing everything we could. Had a buffalo so close to the car, my mother could have reached out and touched it! The scenery is beautiful! Yes it was crowded in spots, but this is a National Park! Expect it and work with it. Also - the morning temperature was 37 degrees, so take jackets!

You will need to stay and walk around. Plenty to do. If you are close and have the time to spend please do so. If you touch the ground you will find it is warm.

We spent the first day looking at the geysers, the second day driving north through Mammoth Hot Springs into Lamar Valley to see all the herds of bison, and the third day hiking and driving through the Grand Canyon and the amazing waterfalls there.

Otherwise read all the safety info and have fun! Also the architecture at the Old Faithful Inn was incredible. We are passing through and only had one full day in the park so we barely saw anything. Exploring this park would require much more time. If you are short on time I'd highly recommend seriously limiting what you try to see. For one full day we drove south to north, stopping for Old Faithful, and stopping at about 3 other places for a picnic and a couple very short hikes (like 1/2 mile hikes). We could not complete either loop, just took the direct route between the entrances. It was a great day but don't expect to see or do more than that in one day! It was extremely crowded, but not as bad as we anticipated. We were able to park at each of the stops we went to, but at least once we had to wait for a spot and the lots were mostly full even in the less popular areas. Go early!! And traveling south to north seemed less busy. Please follow all the wildlife rules!!

Yellowstone National Park,"We did a two day trip to Yellowstone. On day one, we spent a lot of time around Canyon Village, seeing the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. First we went up the south rim and took a lot of the beautiful shots of the lower Falls. Then we did the north rim, basically hiking the entire north rim, seeing more beautiful views of falls and scenery. That afternoon we headed out toward the north east entrance via the Lamar Valley, a lovely, scenic Valley, where we saw a lot of bison. As a matter fact, at one point, a bison was right in the middle of the road, and walked up broadside to the left of our car, looking at us right in the eyes; we were so happy this bison was not angry (e.g. he did not opt to head-butt our car.) The second day was our day of focusing on hot springs and geysers. We toured the Mammoth Hot Springs area and enjoyed the Norris Geyser Basin as well as the Midway Geyser Basin, where the Excelsior Geyser Crater and Grand Prismatic Springs were amazing! Right after leaving there, heading south, on the right, we parked in the fairy falls parking area, and picked up the trail head for Fairy Falls. At one point the trail goes left, and takes you up to a beautiful view of the grand prismatic spring. The high-level view of the spring was all we were seeking; that was a 40 minute round-trip hike and was well worth it; if there are falls off the trail head, we never got to them. Then, we finished up our day with a 4:40 p.m. viewing of old faithful. We have to say that we were very blessed that there was no backed up line into the Old Faithful visitor center at all, and we even got a seat in the front to watch old faithful about a half hour before. Yellowstone is a spectacular place! One FYI regarding Yellowstone- we have AT&T for cellular service, and we had no cellular service during most of our time at Yellowstone.","July 27, 2018",Must do; amazing!,164,"Lambertville, New Jersey",5
Yellowstone National Park,"FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVE CAMPERS READ ME: Do NOT rely on the first-come, first-served campgrounds. Due to unforseen circumstances, my vacation was changed & NO reasonable accomadations IN Yellowstone were reservable. I decided to take my chances & arrive at the park by 6am to try and access the campgrounds (btw, most don’t open until 8am & checkout is usually 11am). When I arrived, most of the campgrounds were marked as FULL at the entrance. I quickly made my way to the “slowest to fill” open campgrounds where a line of cars were waiting (6:49am). The car in front of me snagged a spot, I was the cut off. Then I drove to the next campground-full, and the next-full. Long story short, I was so busy trying to find a place that I missed out on much of the park. I ended up staying in Silver Gate for $150 (1 night) which was all the money I had for the trip. The next morning, I was up & out by 6am but all the campgrounds were full once more. I couldn’t afford another hotel/motel room so I relaxed, enjoyed the park until 9:45pm then drove 5.5 hours back to Mountain Home AFB where I was crashing with my sister. What was supposed to be a 6 day hike-filled trip in Grand Teton & Yellowstone turned into 3 days spent of stress & driving.Lesson learned: Don’t go tent camping in July unless you have reservations OR unless you are fully prepared to back country backpack (which is what I will opt for if I ever make it back to Wyoming). Also, there is lots of National Forest around to camp in. I learned my lesson-you have to have MAPS and PLANS for this trip if you’re coming from far away. Otherwise, this NP is amazing and I am very grateful for it’s protection & conservation. The park rangers in the visitor services centers seem overworked. They are nice and very helpful but seem overwhealmed, tired, and need more resources.The majority if people visiting are only interested in driving the roads & stopping to see roadside wildlife & sights. Which is fine. But if you want to HIKE, beeline it to one of the stores and buy a more detailed map. The free maps handed out are not geared towards day hikers wanting to do more than a 2-6 mile loop. You’ll likely have the trails to yourself. Trails are not well blazed, trail junctions often do not have info (which trail is which), and there are often horse trails leading you off the hiking trail. Know how to use your compass, download the NP app & save the map, & PLAN! I did not see a single bear nor evidence of bears on the trails I did but better safe than sorry. Get your bear spray. Bison like to follow the trails & munch. They are aggressive in July. Do not approach. Swing wide or wait. Despite my lack of planning leading to a shortened and less hiking packed trip than desired, I trully hope I can return & do the park right. I’ve never been anywhere like it.

Yellowstone National Park,"President Grant signed into law on March 1, 1872 making this area of 3,468 square miles in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, America’s first national park. It’s also widely acknowledged as the world’s first national park. It is known for wildlife and geothermal features, Old Faithful geyser as arguably the most popular. Lakes, canyons, rivers, waterfalls, and mountain ranges are main attractions, but bison herds wandering down the narrow roads can cause “animal jams.” Bison prefer walking on level surfaces, as their hooves sink into wet soil during spring thaws. Our tour bus was delayed for 45 minutes, creeping along at single-digit speed.Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America, and formed in the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. It is an active volcano—thus the geysers—but no Pompeii-like pyroclastic volcanic explosions. Yellowstone houses half the world’s geothermal features, and was name a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978.At age 66, I experienced my first visit.

Having traveled around Europe and the Middle East, Yellowstone was up there or beyond anywhere I have gone. The park has a diverse mix of physical beauty, from geysers, mudpots, and hot springs, to dense forests, waterfalls, wildlife, and scenery that took my breath away. When possible, it is worthwhile to attend the Ranger talks, which are free and give context to what you are seeing. We ate lunch at three places in the park- both the Yellowstone Hotel (on Lake Yellowstone) and the Mammoth Springs Hotel here fabulous. We attempted to eat lunch in Canyon Village, which was mediocre, cafeteria style, and not much less than the hotel dining rooms.Old Faithful was the least interesting thing I saw. My favorites included: Mammoth Springs, Biscuit Basin, Upper Geyser Basin, Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, Fountain Paint Pot, Upper & Lower Falls, Balck Sand Basin, and Gibbons Falls.Another thing to do is to become a Junior Ranger, which I did at the tender age of 64! Going through the book and completing the activities helped me to focus on and remember more about the trip.While Yellowstone can be physically demanding, it has been made accessible to those that are physically handicapped.

Yellowstone National Park,"After years and years of traveling outside of the U.S. I was convinced to visit Yellowstone National Park. Since I now live in Denver it was an ""easy"" 8+ hour drive, with stops , to the south entrance of Yellowstone. Since it is the high season we could not stay in the park, but we were close by staying in a cabin in Grand Teton National Park which was 2 miles south of the Yellowstone entrance.Each morning we got on the road by about 6:30am so that we could beat the rush in to the park.All of the roads are two lane so you may get stuck behind a slow moving RV or an SUV pulling a camper. There are opportunities to pass but you may be in a long line to do so. Also vehicles will also pull over to take pictures because they may see bison, elk or any number of other animals in the park. This can cause traffic jams. Parking at various spots can be difficult and you may have to circle through the parking lot a few time to finally get a spot.It is hard to describe all of the various types of scenery you will see. Mountains, lakes, valleys, geysers (Old Faithful), hot pots, waterfalls and the list goes on and on.If you are on the south end of the park it is almost 100 miles to the other end so plan you day(s) carefully especially if you decide to use Jackson, WY as your base. Also know that mobile phone and internet availability are spotty at best. Our ""lodge"" did not have any internet or cell phone access, but they did have two land line phones that you could use for free to call anyone in the United States.If you have the time to get there and spend a few days it is well worth the effort.

Quite nice but it took 7 hrs to get from Jackson to West Yellowstone. Why because all the roads linking areas run through the national parks. Maximum speed is 45mph. Within the park there are loads of roadworks only if u look them up do you know about them.No info is given at gates. It's at least 60 miles between gates. So West Yellowstone to Old Faithfull is around 68 miles at max 45mphSo be prepared to do hours of driving.Roads are busy as it's a main road network comnecting places so through traffic is impatient.West Yellowstone to Mammoth Springs is now about 3 hours one way. Toilets are disgusting. Rangers aren't full of information. You ask how long to get somewhere they have no idea of even the mileage. Hotels are the dearest you will find anywhere. You must travel with food and water and a full tank of petrol.Be prepared for crowds at every stop. You may see an animal but there are few laybys and no hard shoulders so pictures are unlikely. There are no herds of bison or elk just stray odd ones. No sign of bears wolves or Eagles.in fact it seemed very devoid of life and we covered every Road.Its a lot of hard work and there are so many national parks worth a visit. So unless you are desperate to see a few mud pots or geysers think long and hard about a trip here.

Yellowstone National Park,Unbelievable place! We drove the entire park. Took us 3 days to see everything. We stayed at Lake Yellowstone Lodge. At nights you can see the stars! Best to download an app on the phone to identify them. It's best to see the popular areas early in the morning before the outside tourists drive in and the tour buses start up. No problem finding gas. We stayed in Tetons before coming and only drove less than 300 miles.,"July 16, 2018",We drove the entire park!,56,"Mission Viejo, California",5
Yellowstone National Park,"There is something about YNP that ""draws"" a person it. Even if you have never been here before, or this is your hundredth time; the area has a spiritual affect that no place else can compare to.The majesty of the mountains, the wildlife, the rivers and lakes, and just the sheer beauty of the area will want you to return time and time again. It is suggested that you visit all areas of the park and plan on at least a full week (more time if you can), to be able to capture the many areas of YNP. The north loop has a rugged beauty and you can see wolves, bison, elk, deer, coyotes, antelope, and bighorn sheep as well as many other types of animals in this area. There are beautiful flowers and a great deal of interesting vegetation as well that are fun to identify.There are many trails, thermal features and places you will want to spend time at. There are learning centers and visitor's centers. There are stunning lakes with Yellowstone Lake being the largest and when it is a clear wind-free day, it can yield some awesome photos. Old Faithful and the visitors's center is another place not to miss. When you are planning your trip, look for reviews, research hikes and what others have made recommendations for. Plan well for this trip, because it will devour your senses and leave you wanting more! Yes, there are beautiful places that cover the earth, but no place like Yellowstone!","July 16, 2018",Never fails to tickle the senses,37,"Santaquin, Utah",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is incredible. We spent 3 nights in 3 lodges (Old Faithful, Canyon Village, and Mammoth Hot Springs). You need a car to experience Yellowstone. We drove over most of the park in 3 days and saw so much. It was good to get up early and see the more popular sites to avoid the people in the middle of the day.

Yellowstone National Park,"This place is such a bliss and a must visit at-least once. Such a huge park with multiple landscapes and well preserved, no matter the crowd you will get to see all you want and there is so much. The 8 shaped route really helps in splitting the trip (upper & lower circle) and very much everything on road can be covered in a 2 day trip, which we did and with children. Comparatively Lower circle due to the number of Geysers need longer time. Also if you are not able to stay inside the park, no big deal as if you can get up early and get into the park before 9AM, the day should be perfectly balanced (we stayed at Island Park). The list of places to be seen is big and everything is good, try to cover everything and we enjoyed the Lamar Valley drive. We saw a lot of Bisons, Deer and few Elks, also one Bear (lucky!!).

We found ourselves expressing gratitude to those long ago who had the foresight to preserve this place for everyone's enjoyment and to those elected over all these years who have funded and maintained this treasure. The park was untouched except for only the necessary facilities to accommodate visitors. Everything was well planned and implemented by the Park Service. The rangers were top notch: knowledgeable, patient and seemed happy to be there. The accommodations for my short term disability (broken femur with full leg brace and crutches) were really helpful!

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is one of the best experiences in not just the US but the entire world. We came to the park via the Beartooth pass which took a little more time but was totally worth it. Once into the park, we passed through Lamar Valley just after noon. There were bison everywhere and very little traffic. It was spectacular! We got to be at Yellowstone for 5 days and visited most of the geyser basins and hot springs. The Yellowstone Lake is beautiful. We saw lots of great waterfalls. The last day we went through Hayden Valley and were not disappointed as we saw more buffalo. The Yellowstone upper and lower falls and canyon were incredible... Something that must be seen to truly appreciate. Only negative was how crowded the park was. Many visitors did not obey park rules pertaining to maintaining a safe distance from wildlife, and using pullouts which caused traffic jams.","July 13, 2018",Awe inspiring,2,,5
Yellowstone National Park,"What a strange place. We enjoyed the eastern half of the park more than the western half because of the Wildlife viewing and the more mountainous terrain. Our favorite area was the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The upper and lower falls are a must-see. If you have time to take a drive out to Lamar Valley, that is gorgeous as well. In the Eastern section of the park is where you will see many animals. Hayden Valley is also filled with bison , and we saw some Antelope and Elk as well. We hiked up to the top of Mount Washburn, and it is a pretty steady climb, but saw mountain goats at the top and a great view from up there. In the parking lot, a black bear sound heard across the highway then across the parking lot and back into the woods. However you have to see the western side of the park where are the geysers and hotsprings and other geothermal features are located. It emphasizes that you are walking around on the largest volcano in the world. Not a favorite of mine in terms of scenery, but just really helped you understand the geological formations. If you could see one feature only on that side of the park, you should see the grand prismatic spring. But not from the boardwalk, hike up to the newly-installed platform on fairy Falls Trail about a mile south of the grand prismatic spring entrance. There you will have wonderful photo ops. If you are in the mood for a marvelous little hike then hike further down on the fairy Falls Trail and you will find the trailhead for getting to the actual Falls on the left. It's about a one and a half mile hike from that point which is not strenuous on a very nice trail, and the Falls are worth it at the end. We went in July and if you didn't get an early start you were going to run into a lot of crowds. Try to go to the main attractions early or late, and then maybe do some of the less populated hikes during the day. If you drive after dark, be very careful. It doesn't seem like it would be hard to see a thousand pound bison in the middle of the road, but it is. Also the park is large. We didn't realize how large and we stayed near fishing bridge on the Southeastern edge of the park and if we wanted to go to Mammoth Springs on the Northwestern edge of the park it would take every bit of an hour and a half to get there","July 13, 2018",See this!,1,High Ridge MO,5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone National park is nearly 3,500 square miles in size. Its full of canyons, valleys, geysers, hot springs, rivers, lakes and mountains. Apart from the beauty of all that you can see bears, bison and wolves. What more could you possible want. It is truly a stunning place. Yellowstone was America's 1st national park, signed into law by president Ulysses Grant on 1st March 1872. So much tho see and so much to do. It can get very busy at the main sites so get up early and get out there.

Prime Rib.Stayed at Madison Campground. No hookups but great campground.2nd day, drove back to Norris and did part of it. Went back toward Old Faithful but could not really see Upper or Lower basins due to motorhome restrictions or just too many people there and could not find parking. Took the boat cruise at Bridge Bay that afternoon and that was the best. Camped at Bridge Bay. A little cooler than Madison but more mosquitos. Saw elk and a black bear when leaving at 6 to go to Old Faithful for tour.3rd day, took the Yellowstone in a Day tour by Xanterra that you can book at Old Faithful Inn. Great but long day.

Yellowstone National Park,"How can you not love Yellowstone National Park. This was our second visit there in 3 years we loved it so much the first time that I had to include it in our trip. The first time I spent a lot of time doing research learning about the park and its history and all the different things you can do while you're there. We stayed three nights at the Old Faithful Inn then moved over to Canyon Village for a couple of nights. Not knowing if we would ever get back again I kept us moving the whole time doing all kinds of Tours and excursions, it was great. This time we only had two nights and we stayed at Mammoth Hot Springs in one of the cabins. We basically did what they call The Grand Tour which is circling the entire Park from North to South and Back Again. Drove from Mammoth to Lamar Valley down to West thumb back over to the geyser Basin and then back up to Mammoth again. Didn't spend a lot of time In any one place just out cruising and enjoying the beautiful scenery. There's something special for everyone at the park but our favorite has to be the north side of the park from Mammoth over to Lamar Valley its some of the most beautiful scenery, valleys and Vistas the park has to offer. Lamar Valley and for that matter Hayden Valley are where the majority of the people go to see wildlife. If you spent any time in Yellowstone and don't see some kind of wildlife you had your eyes closed the place is just full of great things to see. One piece of advice I would give you is that don't pass up a bathroom when you get the chance you never know what the next corner has in-store for you. It's very easy to get caught in a buffalo Jam or a bear jam and be stuck there for 45 minutes waiting for it to clear. Especially Buffalo they tend to walk right down the middle of the road and there's nothing you can do about it until they decide to get out of the way. I recommend if you plan on going there spend at least few days so you have time to see a little bit of everything. We found that the crowds were never that bad unlike Yosemite which is a single Valley, Yellowstone is spread out so its never is too crowded in one spot. Do some research and figure out exactly what you want to do, they have one of the best National Park websites I've seen to help you plan your trip. Unfortunately it would take a lifetime to see it all.","July 11, 2018",You can spend a lifetime and not see it all,25,"Round Rock, Texas",5

Planned it perfectly. Went out in the park our first 3 days knowing the closer the weekend got the busier it would get in the park. Spent our last two days exploring West Yellowstone. Entrance to Yellowstone was very close to our motel. Got up early and entered the park between 6am - 7am. Avoided the tour buses, and got to see Old Faithful and the lodge prior to crowds arriving. Took the upper loop our second day, and lower loop the 3rd. There was some road construction in the upper loop which caused a delay of about 25 minutes, but it wasn't bad. Upper loop has Travertine Terrace, and Mammoth Hot Springs, Also many places to stop along the way in both loops (with restrooms). Still snow on the ground but nothing on the roads. Lots of Bison, and saw Elk in Mammoth Hot Springs. Each loop took about 4 hours because the scenery is so beautiful, you keep stopping to take pics. It just kept getting better.

The post office was closed because it was Saturday, there was no machine where you could purchase stamps and I was unable to purchase in the store. At Norris, no one was attending to the restroom, which was absolutely disgusting (I’ll spare you the details...just take some hand sanitizer and tissue if you go...and maybe some Lysol to spray yourself down with).

Viewing animals was entertaining and exciting. When you plan your visit plan your route carefully as you can waste a lot of time in the car. Also plan to get to the most popular spots early or late in the day as the parking lots fill up fast. If you are entering through the West Yellowstone entrance go early as backups do occur at peak times. Also, factor in extra time for delays due to animal sightings along the road. Finally, if you do see wildlife while driving pull off the road before you stop. Too many times during our visit inconsiderate people created unnecessary traffic congestion by just stopping in the middle of the road to view or photograph wildlife.","July 6, 2018",Best national park,29,"Orlando, Florida",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We entered via the West entrance of Yellowstone National Park. Our last visit here took place 7 years ago. This visit, we hit a road block about 5 miles into the park. We knew what the reason was—people stopping on the road to stare and take photos of Buffalos. F.Y.I. the Park has many Buffalos. After one hour delay, we passed the 4 Buffalos that were on the side of the road. Due to late planning we stayed in Gardiner, MT just outside the North entrance. Last visit we stayed a few days at the Yellowstone Lake Hotel & 3 days at the Old Faithful Lodge.We were surprised that gasoline was less costly in Gardiner. The Park has several basic rules: Do NOT stop on the road---park in the pull offs to avoid long traffic delays. No parking on the side of the road to look at wild animals, Do NOT get out of your vehicle in the presence of wild animals. However, people will risk their lives by violating any or all of these rules. The next day, we came upon another traffic blockage. People just abandon their vehicles on the road and/or parked partial on the side stilling blocking traffic. Children running around, cameras setup and then we saw the BEAR among the crowd. Please note, the Park is not stocked with friendly Golden Retrievers–only wild animals who can and do attack people. To the guy who wanted a photo of his son standing next to a bear–what would you do if the bear attacked your kid? Not one person had bear repellant in their hands. The Park Rangers can NOT control events like this. We continued on—the Park is over crowded today. We thought our first visit. 7 years ago that the park was crowded but today there are many problems. We wanted to see a very popular boiling vent, but the parking lot was beyond full—filled with RV’s and a line to enter over one mile long–vehicles on the side of the road waiting to enter. Lots of luck finding a parking spot! The Yellowstone Roads are showing the effects of all the vehicles in the park. At times, it was like driving in NYC. There are signs warning of deep ruts in the road AND they mean deep! Or the pavement drops off into a deep hole. There are many potholes all over the Park, so drive carefully. There are two routes within the Park. One was driving up the Mountain or the one having long delays due to road rebuilding—a mud road kicking up mud everywhere. Our SUV had over 10 pounds of mud on its underside. As we were driving down a sharp curve, I spotted stopped vehicles, cars on the shoulder, people crying and a body on the road covered by a blanket. I just don’t understand why people risk and lose their lives to get near a wild animal. The speed limits on curves are to be believed! Going up a high mountain pass, there was a extremely heavy duty crane being transported to another area. I was behind the 12+ double wheels transporter with a trailer with my four way flashers on. Then on a sharp 15 MPH curve with double yellow lines, this small car decided to pass us and the transport. Luck was with that driver as no one was coming the other way. We stayed in Gardiner for three nights and then left via the Park–entering the North entrance and driving to the South entrance. While driving through the Park, we were delayed by another BEAR adventure. Vehicles stopped on the road, cars parked on the shoulders and people all over the road and wooded area. The Bear was up a tree attempting to get away. Don’t get me wrong, the Park is a great place to visit if you follow the rules. We can envision a limit on private vehicles–including Motor homes to lessen damage to the Park roads and limited parking spots. All in all this was a good trip. Just sad to see our National Parks being loved into a state of disrepair.","July 6, 2018",Just follow the Park's rules!,231,"Maricopa, Arizona",3

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone national Park is a wonderous place in three different dimensions.First, the landscapes are beautiful and well worth a visit on their own merits. There are soaring snow covered peaks, rivers and lovely waterfalls, grassy meadows, and alpine forests. The diversity of nature's wonders is amazing at Yellowstone. Second, the park is full of wild animals, most of which are easily seen. On our recent visit we saw a grizzly bear with cub, two different black bears with cubs, a lone wolf,elk, mule deer, mountain goats and long horn sheep, and of course many, many bison. A few were not in the road . . . .Third, the thermal features in many areas of the park are without equal on the planet.Over 60% of all the thermal geysers on planet Earth are in Yellowstone. Old Faithful,of course, is the most famous and most visited, but there are many others, including one or two that are larger but less predictable.You cannot possibly see Yellowstone in a single day. It is enormous, having territory in three states. Plan on at least three days. Do realize though that the park is inundated with tourists from all over the globe. Expect crowds and learn to go with the flow right from the start.And, respect the wild animals. They are not pets or domesticated and you can get seriously hurt if you encroach in their territory. While we were there, a bison gored aCalifornia woman who wanted to pet it. You really do have to engage your brain whenaround the animals. Ditto the dangers around the boiling springs and geysers. Signseverywhere warn tourists to stay on the pathways, but you see many walking all over the terrain. One or two get killed every year. BE CAREFUL and obey the signs. Watch your children closely.","July 1, 2018",There Is Only One,86,"New London, NC",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Went there in June. Saw the geothermal activity which was really cool. So many geysers. We took a hike through the area with old faithful, which is definitely worth it! We saw a coyote on the hike and multiple geysers went off. Later in the evening when driving we spotted a bear with 2 cubs and just a couple of miles after we spotted a brown and a black bear. There where a lot of tourist around the old faithful geyser both otherwise it wasn’t too crowded.

Yellowstone National Park,"This was by far one of the best National Parks we have visited so far. There is so much to see. Give yourself at least a week. We went with a tour group, the first time we have done this. We now feel that’s the way to go when visiting a new area. We didn’t have to worry about driving, since we were on a large charter bus, and our instructor took us to the best places to see in the park. This eliminated us from having to do massive amounts of homework on what to see and where to go in the park. Yellowstone is truly a national gem and I hope the public will keep big corporations from continuing to try to come in and mine the resources – ultimately destroying the pristine areas. We also need to protect the ecology from hunters who want “trophies” for their homes. The environmental balance depends on us leaving it natural without disturbance. We saw elk, deer, bison, blue birds, swans, ducks, black beers; hiked through riparian areas, lush forests, and walked along streams and on trails to waterfalls. This natural beauty is a splendor to see. The thermal areas were awesome too. This is a “don’t miss” if you like nature in its original splendor.","June 29, 2018",See It While It's Still Protected,11,"Destin, Florida",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Went for a 1 day trip through the park yesterday. Getting in from West Yellowstone was ok, but half way to Madison junction, there was a loooong traffic jam. No clue why, so we stopped at the river for a picnic. When we continued our trip, we figured out why: there was a bison laying 20 yards off the road and everybody stopped in the middle of the road to take pictures. There are signs all along the road “NO stopping, walking or parking along the road. Do people just don’t care or ignore? Or are they just so stupid?Drove on to Madison and another traffic jam, now for an elk. At the junction turned right to go see Grand Prismatic again. Another traffic jam, now for cars in line waiting to get on the next parking lot. Not a good sign....Grand prismatic, same story, cars waiting on the road and parked everywhere along the road. Went on to Old faithful. Parking lot (and it is a big one!) full. Found a spot finally and walked around a bit for the traditional things (including an ice cream). Had to change our idea from a scoop (45 min waiting line) to soft ice. This stillness s my favorite national park, but stay away in the summer!!! No way to ENJOY the park. I’ll be back for the last weekend of October. Sure I’ll enjoy my time in the park then, being almost alone....","June 28, 2018",Still the most amazing park,58,"Nazareth, Belgium",5

Yellowstone National Park,We had 5 fantastic days in Yosemite. There is so much to see from beautiful scenery to wildlife to the thermal features.We started in the North at Mammoth and went on to Roosevelt followed by the Canyons and then Old Faithful staying in the lodges at those locations. We also visited the Lake Lodge. All the lodges are comfortable although the dining options are poor with the exception of Old Faithful Inn. We did all the Grand Loop road apart from 15 miles between the Lake Village and Canyon Cabins and all of it is worth seeing. Overall the traffic want too bad apart from Bison traffic jams or Grizzly bears being spotted.Our top 5 things were:Wildlife spotting Grand Canyon of YellowstoneOld FaithfulTrail Walking Lamar Valley,"June 27, 2018",Amazing Beautiful and Diverse,96,"Frieth, United Kingdom",5
Yellowstone National Park,"There is so much to say about Yellowstone. Yellowstone was made a National Park in 1862, when President Grant signed the Congressional Act into law. It became America's first National Park and remains the most popular. Other countries have followed this idea in creating their own national parks.Yellowstone sits on it's own volcano, which is thought to provide the heat for the thermal features.If you come into the park from the NE entrance you will encounter the Lamar Valley. This is home to the herds of bison which range anywhere they like, including the road in front of your vehicle.Next is Tower Fall where John Colter was the first white explorer to see and make note of the thermal features and geysers. If you continue west, you'll reach the North Entrance and Mammoth Hot Springs Terrace, the home of the terraced 'Minerva' on the Lower Terrace. There is a human-acclimated herd of elk that lives in the village year around.Going south is the Norris Geyser Basin where Steamboat Geyser is. It doesn't erupt often but when it does, its exceptional.If you continue west from there, you will reach the west entrance. SE takes you to Yellowstone Lake, the largest high elevation lake in North America. The lake has filled in part of the volcanic caldera. Boating, fishing on the Fishing Bridge, lake cruises, and wildlife viewing awaits the visitor there. Going SW is where the West Thumb Area is. Leaving there and going NW is how to find the famous Old Faithful Geyser in the Upper Geyser Basin, and the remarkable Inn of the same name. This geyser now erupts about every 90 minutes. The Upper Basin is also the home of the Morning Glory Pool and the Firehole River.Going north again gets you to the Midway and Lower Geyser Basins. Midway is where you'll find the Grand Prismatic Spring.All through the park are opportunities to see bear, elk, bison and even wolves, not to mention the eagles and the wildflowers. The famous Lower Falls is located in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, as well as Inspiration and Artist's Points.We had just two full days to see most of this and they were full days. We stayed in Cooke City and West Yellowstone, driving back in each day. The National Park pass made this easy.Accommodations are available inside the park at the grand old hotels, but they normally are booked full months in advance, and sometimes even years. Accommodations can be dated but the fun is staying in the historical places.Mammoth Hot Springs, Tower-Roosevelt, Canyon Village, Grant Village, Old Faithful, Madison Junction and Norris Geyser Basin are all full-service Ranger Stations with hotels, restaurants, cabins, restaurants, gift shops, general stores, gas, post offices and other features.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is a beautiful and amazing place. The thermal features are just awe inspiring, the entire landscape is incredible and you will not be disappointed, especially if you are an armchair geologist lol.But, as someone with social anxiety disorder, the time to go definitely is not in the summer. Holy crowds Batman, parking is a nightmare, tour bus after tour bus after tour bus seems to pour into the park, and crowd you out while you wait for Old Faithful to erupt (seriously, I was sitting in the front row and could barely see it between the tour bus folks that showed up out of nowhere once it started. That was freaky, where did they all come from??). Nobody was respecting the “do not enter” signs. I saw people throwing stuff into the thermal features. Someone threw a hat (well several someones from the quantity of hats there). People walking wherever they wanted, not staying on the pathways. So frustrating. I’m glad it’s popular, I really am, just, I don’t even know, have rangers stationed to manage parking? I could say build more parking but it’s a delicate ecosystem so not sure they can do that? Honestly I don’t know what a solution would be to the huge crowds. If I were to visit again, I would go in late September, early October. There would be less people then. Right?

Yellowstone National Park,"A visit to both Yellowstone and the Grand Teton National Park is a visit to two of the most amazing and special places that our planet has to offer. In order to see the park probably, I recommend staying at different lodges around the park so that you aren’t driving long distances each day. But remember, in order to reserve accommodation within the park you’ll need to book early, and by early I mean at least a year out. We began our trip by staying two nights at the rustic but clean Roosevelt Lodge. If possible, request a 3 bed cabin next to the babbling brook. From this location, we explored: - Lamar Valley at sunset- Spent a morning walking the 5 mile South Rim Canyon hike which included descending the 328 metal steps at Uncle Tom’s, viewing the falls from Artist Point, and leaving the crowds behind as we hiked into bear country along Clear Lake and through bubbling thermals and mud pots- Rode horses through Pleasant Valley to the Old West Dinner Cookout (absolutely recommend)- Hiked the 2 mile Trout Lake Trail (a must)- Walked over the suspension bridge on the Hellroaring Creek Trail- Tower Falls for lunch- The Brink of the Lower Falls (a must).We then headed south to our next accommodation where we spent 2 nights at the Lake Yellowstone Frontier Cabins. From this location we:- Took a morning ‘Picture Perfect Photo Safari Tour’ which I can’t speak more highly about- Relaxed in the sun room of The Yellowstone Lake Hotel. After 3 days of hiking and spotting wildlife, it was time to spend a day exploring the geysers. This included:- Norris Geyer Basin- A quick dip at the Firehole Swimming Hole (one of the few places in the park that you can swim but be warned, it’s freezing)- Fountain Paint Pots- The Grand Prismatic Spring (MUST SEE)- The Old Faithful which is the most frequently erupting big geyser in YS. For our 5th night we retired at the stunning Old Faithful. Even if you aren’t able to stay at this Inn, make sure to stop by and have a meal or at least a drink as it’s truly breathtaking.On our final day in Yellowstone we stopped to view the Sapphire Pool (a must) at Biscuit Basin before heading south to the Grand Tetons.","June 24, 2018",Yellowstone NP should be on everyone’s bucket list!,3,"Dallas, Texas",5

We had plenty of room to park, and walk. Not yet as crowded as will be in the summer. Impressed with behaviors of fellow visitors. Everyone took turns stopping cars and taking roadside photos of the wildlife. No one was pushy or belligerent. Some of our best wildlife views were in Lamar Valley and Hayden Valley, and while driving on Grand Loop Road. We twice attempted to see the Grand Prismatic Spring but it was too fogged over. We did, however, see a Bison at the Fountain Paint Pot, very close to the boardwalk.","June 24, 2018",3rd Week of June was Perfect Time to go,23,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Don’t worry about food because each area has lots of places to eat and a general store. It was very convenient to stay in the park. Be sure to book early.

We reached Old Faithful Inn, checked in and talk about perfect timing because Old Faithful Blew 15 minutes after our arrival so we watched in awe. Next morning we were up and out of the hotel at 6am and had The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone all to ourselves there is a beautiful waterfall and wildlife we’ve stopped to see along the way. I did the North Rim trail while my family drove to the other side to meet me, we had lunch at the Grand Canyon Visitor Center shopping center and drove to see Yellowstone Lake.

There is no cell service in the park, so we couldn't call for help. Someone offered to drive my husband to the ranger station to call a tow truck. The ranger was aware of the location of the pothole, so we wondered why it wasn't filled. Isn't the $35 admission fee supposed to be for maintaining the park?

Yellowstone National Park,"Visited on June 19. We basically spent the entire day stuck in various traffic jams trying to get through the park from the South Entrance to the North Entrance. We got to see one thing (Old Faithful) and had to skip everything else on our list due to the horrendous traffic. “Bison jams” are random and can last for hours. No cell service (anywhere, not even in major visitor centers), so when you are stranded in a traffic jam somewhere in the middle of the park, you can’t contact anyone. It can take well over an hour to get from one restroom to the next. We watched people run into the woods to relieve themselves. Place is completely overrun with foreign tourists with no regard for traffic / parking etiquette. Very few roads, so once you are in the middle of the park, your options are very limited. We entered the south entrance at 9am (first mistake - need to enter no later than 7am) and as I write this I am stuck in our fourth MAJOR traffic jam (the kind where people just get out of their cars and walk around) at 6:00pm having seen only Old Faithful and Biscuit Basin. At this point we are just trying to get out of the park to make it to our cabin in Gardiner, just outside the North Entrance. We skipped everything else on our list because we had no choice. So much natural beauty here, but roads aren’t set up to handle the volume of people trying to see it. Unless you are someone who enjoys spending your vacation time sitting in endless traffic jams, STAY AWAY!!! Glacier National Park and Grand Teton National Park were breathtakingly beautiful with much less traffic.

Yellowstone National Park,"The word is out. Last year wasn’t even the busiest on record but due to construction and more individual vehicle visits replacing some International traffic which formerly used mass transit, buses, coupled with construction projects caused unimaginable congestion. The park is still one of the most amazing places on earth and I recommend you see it. But please plan ahead. It you spread your visit over no fewer than three days, you will not feel so much pressure to get as much in as was possible in one day five short years ago. This amazing place is under demand of many more people than can be supported by the available roads and parking. Case in point, I usually drive my tour buses thorough the South Gate before 9:30 a.m. and have done well. But two days ago a bear sighting in Teton Park delayed my arrival at the entrance until almost 10:00 a.m. what a difference 30 minutes made that day. I usually reassure visitors that delays entering the park are never as bad as rumored, that multiple kilometers of traffic backed up require hours to just enter the park. The reason it’s not so bad as that is because you don’t have to wait for the gate to be opened. Barring construction or ice, you may drive through at any time. Please drive cautiously because animals may be in the road or may jump onto it. But just as I was saying that, the traffic was backed up farther than I’ve ever seen it, more than 2.5 km. We were patient, we got though and had a marvelous day. But it’s not even July yet. I love Yellowstone. I hope you will too.

Amazingly great weather sure helped, but the entire trip was an awesome adventure, highlighted by these national parks. I read for a year and researched heavily to use our time there wisely. I planned extensively. But the best thing I did to make our time at the parks enjoyable and meaningful was to rent a “Gaper Guide!”These GPS units give you important and interesting information as you drive through the parks. They know where you are and give advice accordingly—“skip this hike unless you are VERY fit, “or, “don’t miss this Geyser.” Truly amazing and worth every penny!Yellowstone lodging is expensive, as well as the surrounding towns. Meals, too, are costly (and not great). If I ever repeat this visit, I would consider a more money-saving method.

We learned a great deal, the geothermal features were extremely interesting and differed from each other greatly so you don't get bored seeing them. Any wildlife spotting is exciting and the views everyone are beautiful. The only drawback could be crowds at the height of the tourist season because traffic can back up for animal sightings and waiting for parking in some areas. If you visit, spend some time studying the map of the park in advance to avoid driving back and forth. I highly suggest staying in one of the hotels in the park and pre-booking some of the guided tours through the Xanterra website. The guides were excellent, it was educational, comfortable to drive around, and you are free to enjoy the beauty rather than watching the road.

Yellowstone National Park,"We spent 2.5 days in Yellowstone National Park but would recommend staying at least 3 whole days to visit the whole park. 1st day we drove from Grand Teton National Park to West Yellowstone and visited the east side of the loop... the busiest side. Old Faithful Geyser was a bit underwhelming... you're better off visiting the Steamboat Geyser in Norris which is very active at the moment - it's the world's tallest geyser and if it stays this active, it won't disappoint! Biscuit Basin in the Upper Geyser area was nice. Middle Geyser Basin is spectacular (this is where the Grand Prismatic Spring is) so spend more time here. Stop at the Fairy Falls parking and walk for about 15mins to the Grand Prismatic Spring overlook - SPECTACULAR! The walk is easy and only gets steep in the last section as you climb to the overlook but it's worth it. THIS IS the shot you want of this colourful spring. The Firehole Lake Drive has this mini 'volcano' geyser that erupts every 30 minutes - quite nice. And just opposite a stop at the Fountain Paint Pot is well worth it.. there's colourful springs and another active geyser.2nd day we drove from West Yellowstone to Gardiner. Visited the Paint Pots - wasn't worth it. Stopped at Norris (parking is very busy so be prepared to queue in your car; Porcelain Basin was so, so) for the Steamboat Geyser which is currently very active and a highlight. We then drove to Canyon and did drove the North Rim and South Rim to the waterfall lookouts. Over the falls and Artist Point were our favourites. We then drove to the Lamar Valley and saw hundreds if not thousands of bison in a herd... that was spectacular. We only drove about half way then turned back as it was getting late... spotted a grizzly on the way to Mammoth Springs. We drove on to Gardiner where we spent the night.Next day we drove back to Mammoth Springs (10 mins drive from Gardiner) for a quick visit. We only walked to the viewing point then drove the loop to the top of the springs. Nothing much really... I think after seeing the incredible beauty of the Grand Prismatic Spring, everything else faded in comparison!","June 15, 2018",Grand Prismatic Spring is out of this world!,60,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We were here for five days. Every section of the park has wonders to see. You will definitely see bison, as they are everywhere. We also saw quite a bit of elk. We saw one black bear and cub. The geothermal activity is fascinating. There are many different hikes that can be done, varied by ability. The visitor centers are nicely done. The park rangers are very knowledgeable and helpful. I had a wonderful time.","June 15, 2018",There are so many beautiful and amazing things to see here,158,Raleigh,5
Yellowstone National Park,"Sure, there is thermal stuff happening, but that's it. It's all basically turn-offs the busy flat two-lane road into massive parking lots with enormous t-shirt stores in an unremarkable setting. Sorry to say it, but Yellowstone is now just a heavily marketed theme park, over-rated and over-crowded. But at least the good news is that the hordes with their iPhones hoisted at Old Faithful won't bother you at truly awesome parks like Black Canyon of the Gunnison and Grand Teton and the Great Sand Dunes. And as for a drive, there's nothing to beat Alpine Ridge in Rocky Mountain National Park.","June 15, 2018",No Reason For This To Be A National Park,90,,2
Yellowstone National Park,"This is arguably one of the best learning and beautiful experiences of a lifetime. Even if you are not into volcanism, the beauty of it and the surrounding landscape can take your breath away. Standing in the area that will sooner or later blow the western part of the US and Canada to smithereens and cause much of the world's destruction can give you chills. The geysers and boiling fumaroles with their colorful micro organisms mimic another world's ecosystem. There is even a little petrified wood around in the forest areas. Have a picnic at the many tables here and there but make sure there are no hungry bears around first, or you might end up lunch yourself. There is no shortage of wildlife and to watch a bison walk past your car gives you a great perspective of how huge an animal they are. And, of course, there is Old Faithful, no photo necessary.

Yellowstone National Park,"First time visiting this part of the country and well worth it! With Yellowstone being our oldest and so large, it is like visiting several parks at once. Old Faithful was beyond my expectation. Mammoth Hot Springs is majestic! Any geyser is well worth a stop. The Canyon Falls of Yellowstone is amazing. Lake Yellowstone is truly a beautiful lake especially with the mountains as a back drop. It takes a long time to drive between all of the 'must' see sights. Early June the traffic and road construction wasn't terribly bad as far as holding us getting between places. However, if you are not one to want to take pictures of the wildlife, there are lots of tourists who absolutely have to stop and take pictures - especially the bear sightings! Even with signs, not to stop, tourists can not help themselves. We even had Bison walking in the middle of the road. They seemed unaware of holding up cars. Watch out in Mammoth Hot Springs for the Elk, they were on the lawns near a lot of people. Rangers were not necessarily attentive in having people stay away from them. Caution - there are some primitive bathrooms!

Yellowstone National Park consists of nearly 3,500 square miles of wilderness (sometimes gorgeous and other times, eerie-looking), all of which is located atop a volcanic hot spot.Just when you think that you haven't seen anything more breath-taking than the lush forests & eye-popping canyons that are home to hundred of animal species, then the bubbling hot springs, mud pots, and geysers create a total ""out-of-this world"" experience!We do agree with the advice from another TA reviewer....please obey the speed limits throughout the park. Foremost, for safety reasons......... but also to spot animals roaming by the roads. We spotted a grizzly swimming in the river, a wolf walking on a dirt path, and an elk standing under a tree.

We witnessed old faithful blow which was spectacular and there were many people there waiting too. It was cold so everyone was wrapped up. We saw the Yellowstone river and did a lot by car which was helpful as the park is so huge. You’re given a newspaper when you drive in and it tells you the top five things to do so we circled them on the map and did them all. We had a campground at Grant Camp at $33p/n which was okay considering you get your campsite, fire ring, toilets and you can shower twice a day.

So glad we brought our own snacks and lunch makings but it was sometimes hard to find picnic tables to eat at.

Yellowstone National Park,"This is a very beautiful park BUT I didn't give it a 5 rating because of the horrible roads and parking. Most of the roads are narrow and there are MANY steep drop-offs with no guardrails. These conditions should have been addressed years ago. If you do not like mountain driving, you might want to think about taking a tour. I heard many people talking about the stress they felt driving through this park. The drive from Tower Roosevelt to the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is VERY treacherous with steep drop-offs in the outside lane. NO GUARDRAILS until you get to the top. And this is true of MANY of the roads in Yellowstone. They should have added guardrails 50 years ago to so many of roads not to mention they need widening. The view at the south rim also needs warning signs of the danger posed. They have some boulders there about 2 feet high and there is nothing but the steep cliff on the other side. I personally had to grab a little boy and pull him off of them as he was about to go over the edge. His parents weren't watching him BUT there are NO warning signs to parents to watch their children and alert them to this danger. The parking situations at the attractions along the loop are also very bad. The park management refuses to cut down a few trees and enlarge the parking areas. There are millions and millions of trees in the park and cutting down a few to enlarge the parking areas AND to widen the roads, will have little affect on the park, BUT will enhance the safety and make it a better experience for the visitors.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is beyond your wildest imagination, unless you spend your days consuming substances that aren’t yet legal. The variety: geysers, mudpots, fumaroles, hot springs, mountains, valleys filled with wild animals, exotic birds, steam *everywhere*. It’s simply phenomenal. We were there in late May-early June. It’s a perfect time. The park is open, but the crowds aren’t too bad. We had one day of snow (it made it hard to see much scenery), but the gorgeous days were incredible. Comfortable, and let me say it again, not too crowded! It’s obvious the big limitation to Yellowstone is how many people want to come, and do come, and vast as it is, it can be overwhelmed. So go on the shoulder seasons if you can. Must sees if time is limited: Upper Geyser Basin (i.e. around Old Faithful), the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (either side works for great pictures - you don’t really need to do both sides unless you have the time), and the Lamar Valley. We enjoyed many other of the features - Mammoth Hot Springs, the Hayden Valley, the Grand Prismatic Springs, and waterfalls like Moose Falls - but pace yourself!

Yellowstone National Park,"We spent a couple days here last month, during the week before Memorial Day. On our first day exploring Yellowstone National Park, we were blessed with beautiful weather. Because we knew the next day's forecast called for rain, we pushed ourselves into a very full day, trying to fit everything into our one nice day. Thankfully, it worked. We entered on the west side of the park. We hiked the Artist Paint Pots trail, stopped at the Norris Geyser Basin, and looped up north to Mammoth Hot Springs, where we ate lunch. We then drove over towards the Lamar Valley, and then backtracked a bit to see Tower Fall and drive the beautiful Dunraven Pass, which had just opened a day or two earlier. The kids loved the huge snowbanks there. We hit up Artist Point, West Thumb Geyser Basin, Midway Geyser Basin and Grand Prismatic Spring, and then caught the last daylight eruption of Old Faithful. The sunset was beautiful, and we watched it from the Two Ribbons Trail, just before we exited the park. It was a jam-packed day! In all, we spotted one grizzly bear, two black bears, a pair of trumpeter swans, mountain bluebirds, magpies, chipmunks, and countless elk, pronghorn, geese, and bison. In fact, we even saw a bison headbutt a pickup truck! It really was an absolutely amazing day. We couldn't have asked for more.Day two was as forecast: cold and rainy. We were so glad we had crammed so much into the day before. However, we still hadn't visited the Old Faithful Inn, so we stopped there for a bit. It was crowded due to the weather, but we watched Old Faithful erupt again from an outdoor deck at the inn. You could barely tell what was geyser and what was just the weather! We explored a bit inside the hotel before hitting the road. As we drove up in elevation, the rain turned to snow! The kids were thrilled. It really was beautiful. The weather wasn't keeping the animals in hiding either. We saw plenty of bison, including the little ""red doggy"" babies, as well as many elk. We passed Lewis Lake and surprisingly found a good portion of it still frozen! I'm glad we got to see a bit of the park in snow, but I felt bad for all the tourists hiking around the sights in rain gear, parkas, and umbrellas. My number one tip for visiting Yellowstone? Go when the weather is good! ;) Seriously, shoulder season was a great time to go. Lower crowds and almost everything was open. We still definitely felt like we got a full Yellowstone experience!","June 4, 2018",Excellent!,68,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Yellowstone National Park,"You cannot realise how unworldly the park is with steam rising from the ground all around you, weird coloured pools and mineral build-ups forming crusts.

However there’s so much more to see.Bison strolling around, causing traffic hold ups, is something else. I wouldn’t care to be on a motor cycle, as these animals are big!We came via the west gate from West Yellowstone, just over the border in Montana. By 9am there was a long line already.

Yellowstone National Park,"We were here for a long Memorial Day holiday and spent 5 wonderful days exploring Yellowstone National Park. We flew to Bozeman, Montana and rented a car to drive here. The Bozeman airport is one of the nicest airport we've been in and they have a Yellowstone store right next to their baggage claim area. We bought a one week pass ($30) at the store - you still have to stop at the park's entrance gate to have the park ranger initial the pass. There wasn't a line when we got to the West entrance (took about 3 1/2 hours) to reach Old Faithful Snow Lodge by late afternoon. We stayed a couple of nights here and then two more nights at Yellowstone Lake Hotel. We had plenty of time to see Old Faithful Geyser and hike to the other geysers and hot springs in the area. I was in awe of the beautiful scenery and all the wildlife we saw in our oldest National Park. There were many encounters with buffalos, prolong antelopes, elks, coyote, black bears and grizzly. The bears we saw were in the Lamar Valley near Yellowstone lake when we were driving the loop.  I bought the Yellowstone Guided Tours app for my phone and also a cellphone adapter to plug into the car lighter. The app doesn't need wifi but it will run down your cell phone battery so you will need to use the lighter adapter. The GPS app knew our location in the park and we got our own guided tour of the area and suggestions on where to stop. We were fortunate that the weather for the first 2 days were warm in the high 70's and then much cooler when we were staying at the Yellowstone Lake hotel. The buffalos move slowly whenever we saw them but on our last day when we were leaving we encountered about 50 buffalos on the road coming towards us. They were walking at first but then they took off running and I was scared they were going to run into our rental car. Days earlier, the Park Ranger had told us they can pick up speeds of up to 30 mph and I saw it with my own eyes they can move fast.

Yellowstone National Park,"I was surprised to see Trip Advisor has a listing for a park so vast, so diverse and with to many individual attractions also listed with their own review. Simply put, for anyone – American, foreign tourist Martian – this is a MUST SEE in their lifetime. The idiots in DC – where I live – who wanted to radically raise the price of visiting the park have obviously never been here. Where to start? First, if affordable and you can plan well in advance, stay in the park. This greatly simplifies any visit. Second, with 2.2 million acres, there is a lot to see so do some reading beforehand. Everyone wants to see Old Faithful – but other geysers have their own powerful attraction, such as Riverside Geyser. If you are into wildlife, we saw bison, bears, elk, antelope, owls, osprey, marmots, rabbits, a bald eagle. I recommend you do your reading than come back to Trip Advisor to check out individual attractions. If you have very limited time, the geysers and pools around Old Faithful – there is a well laid out walkway/boardwalk that you can navigate easily – alone are worth a visit.","June 2, 2018","Vast, Wonderful, Compelling, A Must-See",216,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

Yellowstone National Park,"For sure, you could spend weeks visiting all places there, but 5 days of a very busy itinerary is enough to see all the highlights. I also recommend to avoid staying in expensive lodges in the park, as you could find accommodation at each entry gate. Example of itinerary for active persons is:1. Day 0 - Grand Tetons N.P and overnight 2 miles from the South entry at Headwaters lodge and Cabins at Flaggs Ranch2. Day 1- early morning drive via South Gate to see Old Faithful while there is no crowds. You will easily spend 2 hrs on boardwalk trails there to see different geysers.Visit also Upper and Middle geyser valley and return to the West Thumb geysers. Find accommodation on this 1 night in the park.3. Day 2- drive along Yellowstaone Lake and visit Hayden valley (bisons and even wolfs to see). Continue to Grand canyon and do Rim walks there. Hint: lunch at Bistro in Canyon Village. Drive via Lamar Valley (could see herd of bisons, bears, wolfs) to Silver Gate, where cheap accommodation is available.4. Day 3- re-enter Yellowstone and enjoy morning drive via Lamar valley to see wild life. Drive to the start of the trail to Washburn mountain and enjoy about 1hr 45 min hike with wonderful views along and wildflowers. Note that it is cold up there even on a sunny warm summer day. Enjoy picnic lunch on the top. On return, drive via Tower Junction, visit petrified forest (a chance to see bears nearby) and continue to the Gardiner for overnight stay (plenty of nice accommodation there). There is an option to stop for a short swim on the way.5. Day 4. Re-enter the park and spend the morning at Mammoth Hot Springs. Then continue along the Grand loop road to West Gate with many stops on the way including Norris basin and Artist's paintpots. Overnight in West Yellowstone.6. Day 5- Re-enter the park and spend either 1/2 day or full day depending on your schedule. I had to live around 2 pm for the drive back to Salt lake City. I did Firehole River drive and returned to Grand Prismatic Spring where I did a small hike to the observation point above it. Then I did another hike to waterfall.Then it was time to drive back. Each day in Yellowstone N.P. was different and with amazing memories. Everyone could tailor their itinerary with so many things to chose from.For sure, my itinerary was based on summer weather and approximately 10-12 hrs every day. The earlier you reach main attractions, the easier to park. It is more difficult to park between 10am and 3 pm, then either earlier or later in the day.Enjoy planning and trip to this wonderful place!","June 1, 2018",A wonder of the world in 5 days- recommended itinerary,30,"Wollongong, Australia",5

I'm guessing it's because of the lack of humidity.We saw lots of bison (buffalos) and mule deer, but no bears.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is a very diverse park: it has forests, rivers, falls, meadows and plains, mountains, geysers and mud pools. It is a place from another planet and offers something for everyone to enjoy. Go in the beginning or middle of the week when there is light traffic through the park. If you go near a weekend, you'll sit and stare at the break lights of the cars in front of you and rude tourists (of which there are plenty! Tourist buses flood this area every day) will push you out of the way as they are on limited time, so they won't be courteous when needing to take a picture or get to a place fast. If you are reading this, please pay attention to the signs posted throughout the park regarding safety. Do not venture off trails/boardwalks or approach wildlife. There were two visitors walking up on a black bear eating grass near a hiking trail, even though the signs clearly indicated to stay away 90 meters away from bears. That is very irresponsible behavior, playing with death like that. It also poses a threat to the bear, as it might be killed as a result of murdering someone being so irresponsible.","May 28, 2018","Breathtaking, although crowded and dangerous",44,"Bowie, Maryland",5

From Mammoth falls, the mud volcanoes, prismatic pools, the boiling pools of water and the geysers and all the natural wonders are truly amazing.

If you don’t like to be around drivers that stop in the middle of the road, don’t know how to back up a car or park it in a parking space the drive manners of others will drive you crazy. Add to that the bus loads of tourists than run to get in front of you and then stop and take selfies while blocking the walkways and you might end up with bad feelings towards humanity.

Yellowstone National Park,Arrived at the park to take photos at the entrance and I fell flat on my face and broke my phone. We the car is parked they have these raised stones for what reason I don't know but I tripped on these so that was a great start to our visit to the park. Today we did another trip in from the South entrance to go and see Old Faithfull blow hole. The signage to where the blow hole is once we are in the car park is absolutely shocking. There is none and you have to walk for miles to get to it. Bought an egg sandwich in one of the shops in Yellowstone Park or should I say a bread sandwich. It was dry and tasteless. Don't supply any lattes just plain old coffee so they don't cater for visitors out of USA. One good thing I did see a black bear and a brown bear from a distance. No moose which was hoping to see.

Yellowstone National Park,"First visited Yellowstone in 1967, and even now in 2018 it's still a delightful place to visit. Although the mountains are not especially tall or majestic, what Yellowstone offers are world-class thermal features, astonishing wildlife, historic structures, some amazing waterfalls and (in some areas of the park) wide open spaces. However....having visited Yellowstone both for business and pleasure in May in recent years, I've encountered huge crowds in most areas of the park. If the crowds are that bad in May, they must be even worse in June, July or August. Crowds at each of the lodgings, on boardwalks through the thermal areas. Bumper to bumper traffic in some areas. Parking lots full to capacity. And although most people are law-abiding and courteous, a certain percentage (especially from particular countries) are lawless and rude. In recent years, Yellowstone has broken all records for visitation. How to deal with the crowds? First, get up early and hit the top sights before the worst crowds materialize. Second, take a hike on a trail. Once you get a mile or so away from roads, most crowds subside and you can enjoy peace and quiet. Getting out of the car and away from parking lots and paved surfaces will make a huge difference. Also, be aware that most lodgings in the park book up many months in advance. And even for campgrounds that don't take reservations, they can fill up before 9 am in the morning!!!!Bottom line: a must-see place that represents the best that our country offers. But beware the crowds, and be ready to deal with a certain number of rude and difficult people.","May 17, 2018","Still a delight, but crowds getting crazy",348,"Helena, Montana",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We visited May 18.Yellowstone was just magnificent!The first day we went into the park (cost USD50 / includes entry into Teton National Park), we experienced four seasons in one day, we had snow, rain and sunshine. It was cold, it got colder and then warmed up when the sun came out.The views are awesome, to hard to explain. Snow capped mountains, old faithful, frozen lakes, geysers, waterfalls, rapids, clear streams, valleys and beautiful forest.We saw lots of bison, some elk and a black bear.Traffic wasn’t too bad, we had access to all but one road within the park. The southern end of the park had lots of snow (ground level) and frozen lakes. The northern end of the park was completely different.

We went yesterday, the day before Mother's Day and it was great...again. There were very few visitors and time could be take to view the critters and natural beauty without traffic jams and rude tourists. We volunteer at National parks and know a bit about the Park's problems. If at all possible, go to the back country and hike. Do NOT GO DURING THE TRADITIONAL TOURIST MONTS...it will drive you nuts. Drivers are rude, it is over crowded and even the animals disappear....except the Bison...who really do not care about you at all and will stop traffic whenever the notion hits them. do not go in August either unless you are very careful. August is the Bison rut and the bulls are nothing to mess with then and may well take your vehicle on if they perceive it to be in their way or just plain are in a bad mood.. All the beauty of the natural world is in this park...but it can get ruined in a hurry by rude and anxious tourists. Not to mention the oriental tour busses and the selfies being taken by the Orientals pointing at themselves or each other. It is a problem. Our park system is in trouble due to overcrowding. Ed Abbey saw this coming back in the '70's. He was right. Try to go in the off season and you will love it. Go during the summer and you will never go back..

What we did see was nice. It was cool to see how the animals felt right at home. Elk licking shop windows and bison roaming the streets without a care for the cars behind them. There is a nice boardwalk if you want to check out some of the hot springs, but they aren’t open for human entry. You have to stay on the path. I found the walk peaceful and enjoyable.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone National Park was a very unique park to visit with all its oddities and beauties rolled into one. There is so much to see and do that you need a few days to explore. • Oh the wildlife that you will see. Elk, bear (black & grizzly), moose, bison, wolves, etc. The bison walk right down the road making YOU move out of the way.• All the natural formations and hot springs is mind boggling to witness. Please stay on the path though as some of the hot springs are nothing more than a thin crust covering boiling water beneath. We witnessed a foreign family wandering off the path and onto these fragile areas for a better photo opportunity. I couldn’t believe it! With all its natural, dangerous beauty, I can see where this park does not forgive stupidity.• The pavement was literally melting in one area of roadway, due to magma underneath, when we visited. It just goes to show how Yellowstone is a living, breathing entity.• Tips: Gas up BEFORE entering the park. Bring snacks and drinks along for long rides. Bring binoculars or better yet…a spotting scope. We stopped in one section to watch a dying elk be overcome by wolves. You never know what to expect here.• The terrain is mind boggling weird, enigmatic, stunning and beautiful all in one big package. It is a park to explore with common sense though (please stay on the designated paths for YOUR safety). All in all, make the journey here… if at all possible. The sights here will be remembered for the rest of your life. Now get out there and explore!","March 23, 2018",ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! Review Inside!,182,"Little Meadows, Pennsylvania",5
Yellowstone National Park,"My first visit to Yellowstone was when I was about 6. The paths, animals, steam and gysers never left me. Some 40 years later it's still the same, but even better and more meaningful. In my younger days I had no idea what the steam and gysers were about, now knowing that the ancient dormant but active caldera is enthralling. And wraps you in a massive hug when you are standing on top of it. With hundreds and hundreds of varying types of species calling the open range of Yellowstone home, there is never an inactive moment. From an I Osprey gliding the breeze as it hunts for its prey, to the Bison, master of its domain, grazing the fields with its herd or alone. This type of feeling can never be duplicated in another atmosphere. The John Muir of us all begin calling our own mountains here. With ducks in a small pond or the rainbow dancing for its enabling waterfall, there is always a breathtaking moment just in the next second. In that same next second there are dangers that are to be acknowledged and respected. Such as the animals, they are in their habitat, not yours! They can react in their manor, no matter how beautiful they are. Do not make the stupid mistake of getting killed or causing them to be killed because of you. The thermal pools are the same, they react because they are supposed to. Thermal means hot, boiling hot, deaths have occurred because magma is hotter than you are. So be cautious and alert to you and yours.","March 22, 2018",Wildlife Eco Perfect,4,United States,5
Yellowstone National Park,"Made a late Fall trip to Wyoming in October 2017 with my wife who had never seen the State before. We got to Yellowstone right after a 10"" snowfall. The setting was beautiful. Most of the campgrounds were shut down for the upcoming Winter so we basically had the Park to ourselves. We tent camped in Lewis Lake campground and visited Old Faithful as well. The geysers still amaze me. It had been close to 40 years since I had visited this area and am glad to report it still looked quite the same way it did 4 decades ago. The only real differences I noticed was that the Park Rangers no longer feed the Bears(for good reason) and saw where some previous fires had gone through the park. The lakes and water falls were amazing. All in all a great visit.","March 21, 2018",One of a kind!,9,"Conroe, Texas",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We went to Yellowstone because our guest from Asia really wanted to go. AND we live (in relative American terms) pretty close - it's a 5 or 6 hour drive from here. She was visiting during the summer and so we needed to go at that time, and didn't have extra time or money to take it slow. It had been decades - since I was little - that I had been to Yellowstone. And as we drove there, through Grand Teton National Forest, I thought, ""This is SO BEAUTIFUL! Why didn't my family come here all the time?"" (I grew up only about 2 hours away in Idaho.) Anyway, we camped our first night south of Jackson Hole and it was idyllic and I thought to myself, ""We are doing this every year!"" The next day, after spending time in Jackson Hole, and not nearly enough time in Grand Teton because Yellowstone was the main destination, we hurried on. And I will never make that mistake again. Yellowstone, frankly, was meh. Yes, there were a lot of ""once in a lifetime"" photo ops for our Asian friend. To get to those you had to drive a lot, then wait in long lines of other people waiting for their photo op. Was it beautiful? The photo op places were cool, but the forest was surprisingly boring (not strikingly verdant, and the lodge-pole pines made it very one-note). So you drive through not especially beautiful scenery to get out of the car, wait in line to get to the cool geological feature, snap a picture, and get back in the car for another big drive to the next geological feature. This national park is the Disney of national parks. Cool to say you went, but so crowded, if we are being honest, it's not really magical. Then, the camping was HORRID. My husband said the camp ground reminded him of a refugee camp only with better gear. They pack tent campers in like sardines in rocky, gopher hole filled fields. And, though we camped in mid August and have decent gear, we froze. I did not sleep all night - I was too cold. So NOT picturesque, not comfortable, not getting away from it all since the whole world is right outside your tent, all to drive and wait in line for photo ops? No thank you. Did we see animals? Buffalo, right outside our car. But there are buffalo on Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake, so that wasn't especially thrilling. I don't remember seeing anything else and we looked. The kids (ages 5-14) were troopers. Because, like Disney, after you have waited in line, the thing you've waited for is legitimately sweet. But if you have littler people, or people who struggle in the car, or people who don't want to stay on the path and wait in line, OR if you have a group that can't fit in one vehicle and wants relaxing down time ACTUALLY getting away from it all in beautiful nature, Yellowstone is NOT the place for you. We cut our trip there short by 1 day and came home to more beautiful vistas and forests and mountain hiking without lines and warm beds.","March 18, 2018",Cool in a we-did-that way but not that pretty,38,"Wasatch Range, Utah",3

The huge number of thermal features are a reminder of the power of the earth beneath our feet and the scenery is quite breathtaking. We drove around the park guided by the GyPSy Guide app which uses the GPS location in your smartphone to trigger commentary. It gave us much more information and history than we could have otherwise got and also gave us a few detours and side roads that we wouldn't have known about. We also saw herds of bison, particularly in the wide open space of the Lamar Valley, as well as elk, pronghorn and big-horned sheep, although sadly no bears (we did see black bears in the Grand Teton National Park after we left Yellowstone).The only downside for us was how busy it was as we went in the days following the solar eclipse that we had travelled into the area to see. There were so many people and cars in some places that at times it felt like downtown Manhattan. But because the park is so big that fortunately wasn't the case everywhere. The size of Yellowstone is another thing to beware of, particularly for those of us not from large countries such as the US. It is vast.

Yellowstone is just amazing with differing volcanic scenery, geysers, hot springs, lakes, waterfalls, mountains, valleys and rivers not to mention the wildlife that you encounter on your travels, which included bison, bears, elk, beaver and some bald eagles.Old Faithful was as exciting as expected, although a few minutes late of the expected time, obviously nature has it’s own time.Everywhere we went staff and rangers were friendly and very helpful, answering all our questions and pointing out some good places to see the geology.If the opportunity arises we would certainly like to visit again especially in the fall/early winter to get another perspective.You can certainly see why so many people visit here regularly.If there was one small downside it was the number of traffic delays we encountered due to roadworks, which did mean we had to miss out on some of the sites and I suppose the eclipse also played a part in the number of visitors.

Yellowstone National Park,"As of this writing, my wife and I most pleasurably made our third and probably last lifetime's visit to our Nations's Top National Park. Each time over a period of 40 years we have noticed changes in crowds, topography, scenery, and visitor accommodations, food service, and park maintenance and building progress. Staying in Gardiner, MT, we spent three full days viewing this massive park. This time we were slightly unhappy with the traffic congestion due only to rerouting the road between Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris Museum and Information Station. This caused several hours of our time backed up in traffic due to the need to frequently, but temporarily totally shut down the road during peak visitor times daily. However, we can vouch that we saw the entire park in every way we had wanted. Our hope is that other Americans take the time and do likewise in their lifetimes -- it certainly is a gift of life to see YNP!","February 14, 2018",Our Top National Park,123,"Ave Maria, Florida",5

Yellowstone National Park,"As I looked at reviews of Yellowstone NP, the common complaints were traffic and crowds. I just returned from a spectacular snowmobile tour of Yellowstone and am pleased to report that we didn't experience either. Not only is the park even more beautiful under a coat of snow, the number of daily guests is significantly restricted for safety reasons. No cars are permitted into the park. Traffic is restricted to snowmobiles with licensed guides, and snowcoaches (large vans/small busses that run on tracks rather than wheels). My wife and I joined a group of friends for a three-day adventure in and around Yellowstone. Our group used both snowmobiles and the snowcoaches to explore the National Park and the National Forrest area around West Yellowstone. The scenery was absolutely gorgeous at every turn. Our guides were fabulous, staying late to show us more of the area that they love. We saw an abundance of wildlife, learned a lot about geology, and had a lot of fun. This was my fourth visit to Yellowstone. None of the others is a contender in any category I might consider for comparison. BTW, our outfitter provided winter gear that kept us warm. I was never cold, and had a blast driving my sled!

You will see things posted everywhere about a minimum safe distance from each animal....listen to it.I saw people getting within 10 years of a bull elk to take a picture.

Yellowstone National Park,"Years ago, when I was still in high school, I bought my first pair of Chacos. They were amazing. They lasted me five years, and I wear out shoes. I wear out shoes fast. I don't know if I walk funny or am just really clumsy or what, but I know a pair of shoes is great if it lasts me more than 2 years. Five years later, I didn't even hesitate to buy another pair of Chacos when mine finally gave out. My new pair lasted me two years. The last pair I bought made it one year. Through my progression of the shoes, I have watched them bustle in popularity. Everyone has Chacos, and why wouldn't they? You can wear them in the water, you can wear them hiking, they can accompany you to most any summer activity. They are the perfect warm weather shoe. Or they were. Now they only last one year and their soles fall off.To me, this is what Yellowstone was like. When I was younger, it was just the most amazing place- it had everything that a vacation destination could ask for. It was beautiful. It was full of wild animals. Everywhere I looked, there was something breathtaking to feast my eyes upon. The place seemed wild and magical. Now, it has the same features, but has become a sort of national park Disneyland. You sit in traffic jams for 30 minutes, thinking that you are going to see a grizzly bear, only to pull up to yet another buffalo. People hike in lines to major features and ask you to get out of their way so that they can take a selfie with a waterfall while you are appreciating its beauty. Still, when you round a corner and see a colorful hot pool or spouting geyser, when the evening cools the air and steam creeps out of every crevice, there is something powerful about realizing that you are standing on top of a giant volcano that could destroy the world as you know it any moment. Oh! And the pictures seem to always turn out great.","January 22, 2018","Amazing, but crowded",20,"Fayetteville, Arkansas",4

Yellowstone National Park,"A little amusing that Yellowstone National Park is apparently an entry within 'Yellowstone National Park' but okay tripadvisor :)Reviewing the park as a whole - we spent two days here and could have spent more. There is such an amazing diversity here - forests, mountains, wildlife, rivers, lakes, canyons, waterfalls and, my very favorite (since I was once a student of microbiology) many fascinating geothermal areas that all have great personality thanks to all their attendant microbes that live even in these harsh conditions - geysers, hot springs, fumaroles, microbial mats, mud pots, etc. Since Yellowstone is on a caldera, in some places you are very close to the earth's crust and in addition to the microbes, there are many interesting formations caused by the cooling lava in some areas.For me, I'd say the main points to hit are the geyser basins; the Grand Prismatic Spring and the other nearby hot springs are a must see, as well as the Norris Basin, Mammoth Hot Springs with its interesting travertine terraces, and Artist's Point (the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone). Old Faithful is iconic and it was pretty amazing to see it, but it just goes to show there is so much other great stuff in Yellowstone that it's not my 'favorite'.Our kids were 3 and 5 when we went and while they were interested, it was a lot of walking (and driving) for little legs.

Yellowstone National Park,"Nothing I can say here can prepare you for Yellowstone. We paid $50 at the South Gate (from Jackson) for our car with two adults to enter two parks - Grand Teton and Yellowstone, and spent the day there. That ticket is good for seven days. Every corner you drive brings new snow-capped mountain vistas, lakes and wildlife (we saw a grizzly bear, 200 bison and 100 deer). Everything is so beautiful here, so do take your camera. My top tip is that if you see lots of parked cars and people looking - then there is something to see. So pull up...Get a map from a visitor centre, and a ranger will help you (if you ask) to plan your day. There is much more than a day full, so plan according to your time. Old Faithful is a world famous geyser, and you'll want to see it erupt. It does so every c.90 minutes.We are exited at the north gate, having driven the full length of the two parks.

If you aren't hiking in the back country, this is largely unnecessary. We saw plenty of wildlife, but we never saw any bears or wolves. There were signs posted about bears being present in certain areas, and we simply avoided those areas.

Yellowstone National Park,"I know I visited Yellowstone as a kid with my parents. I remember the fuss about Old Faithful and I surely remember the smell of all those sulphur pots. But many years later this Park had much more significance. A large group of us in two cars drove from Jackson through the Grand Teton Natiinal Park to enter the south entrance of Yellowstone. We climbed more than 2000 feet, crossing the Continental Divide 3 times, enroute to Old Faithful. We arrived in time for an eruption then were free to visit the surrounding terrain, visitors center and lodge. It rained (snowed, depending on elevation) the whole day but this did not take away from the natural beauty or many photo ops. We did not make the full Park circuit due to the weather and time constraints, but we did stop at Kepler Cascades, Biscuit Basin, Fountain Paint Pot and Firehole Lake Drive. I would love to return in better weather and spend another 2 (or more!) days exploring.

Yellowstone National Park,"I enjoyed visiting this park but am dismayed that tourists are allowed to vandalize the features without significant if any penalty. Geyers may no longer work because tourists, especially oriental tour groups, like to throw good luck stones into springs and geyser pools. I wonder why offending tour companies are allowed to continue touring within the park. I would prefer discipline or violators rather than shutting off parts of the park to all tourists. Having said this this is still a worthwhile park. Warning it is better to view Grand Prismatic from the overlook (a separate parking lot--do not be fooled by some road signs). My trip was cut short and I am looking forward to a return visit. This park should require a 2 week visit and certainly no less than a week.

Yellowstone National Park,"The various loops/drives are clearly marked on the Park map, so you can choose which way you want to go. It is the stuff of legends: fabulous geysers, calderons, mud pots with amazing colors, magnificent forests and lakes. I was last here in the 70's and we saw lots of bear. Apparently the National Park Service has done a very effective job in educating the public about the foolishness of feeding wild bears, so this time around I saw no bears, only buffalo. One held up traffic for over a mile while it merrily sauntered down the middle of the road. The Lower Falls (National Geographic photo-worth!) was stunning.. Then we ventured up to the Upper Falls where you look down on top of the waterfalls. Surprisingly our only disappointment was Ol'Faithful itself. It dilly-dallied around for 15 to 20 minutes, and when it finally spouted, it was nothing as memorable as I remembered. In fact, there was a geyser that we could see in the distance that was spouting magnificently and for much longer (Castle Geyser).. I asked the Ranger why the public wasn't directed to it, and it is because it does not spout somewhat regularly like Ol' Faithful. My personal opinion is that there is too much infrastructure (Lodge, viewing boardwalks, benches, eating places, and the Visitor Center) to sacrifice taking attention away from Ol 'Faithful.

Yellowstone National Park,"Visited very last days of September. There was snow everywhere on the ground except the higher elevations had several inches of snow. We did not need chains or cables. They keep the roads very clean and simply close those that are not safe. Must see Old Faithful. Check ahead to see when it erupts so you don't miss it. Because it was so cold outside, you could not really see the beautiful Prismatic Pool due to the steam covering it. Most every geyser was that way, but if you wait for the wind to blow the steam clouds away you can see the color. The best time to see animals is early in the morning before 9 am and at dusk. Lots of buffalo on the west side right now and elk at dusk along the rivers. Lots of elk on the east side and towards The Grand Tetons. Canadian geese. Few fox and coyotes near mud volcano. Let me stress if you want to get out of the park in a timely manner, get out before 6 pm!! The bison migrate at dusk and we were stuck behind a herd two nights in a row for over an hour. Rangers seem to move them easier, but otherwise you just have to wait for them to do what they are going to do. This park and its geysers change all the time. It is not the same park we saw 8 years ago. New geysers, some not there any more. Lots of beauty right now! Get there soon though because I think the snow is coming!

Yellowstone National Park,"If you’re searching for Yellowstone to decide whether or not it’s worth the drive, it is. Absolutely. Bar none. Yellowstone National Park is one of the most unique experiences in the world. It both grounds us to our values and challenges our daily lives. Herds of buffalo roam free on the open plains. An array of animals encounter you on the park’s winding roads. Glorious waterfalls flow freely over ancient stone ledges thrust high into the air. Old Faithful keeps to a consistent schedule in a field of geysers atop a vast caldera of lava. Yellowstone cannot be described in words - it must be experienced to be believed.

Yellowstone National Park,"What else can we say other than, ""If you have never visited Yellowstone National Park, you are MISSING out!"" Okay, who are we trying to kid?! There is a LOT more to say! We spent 3 days exploring Yellowstone and still did not see it all. Due to the unseasonably cool weather front that moved in as we arrived in mid-September we spent the first day exploring in the snow and rain. We extended our stay on the east side of the park by an extra day due to the weather and waited until the following day to pull our 42' fifth wheel through the park. SO glad we did! We had no desire to pull the rig through the snow and by waiting had fabulous weather to drive from east to west via West Thumb and Old Faithful etc. Once parked, the next day we drove back in to enjoy some more. Let's talk weather! Folks, Most of Yellowstone is located at a very high elevation thus there are some high passes. What does that mean? A SHORT season and the snow can fall SUPER early. DO DO make sure the park is open. Check the weather forecast and call the park before you go. It could save you a lot of wasted time, energy and money. Is Yellowstone really big rig friendly? Yes for most of it. Having read an online article regarding the road from Canyon Village to Tower Fall not being suitable for big rigs we chose to drive that just with our truck. At 60' long (truck and camper) we are LONG! That road is narrow in places not to mention windy. We are SO glad we just went in the truck but saying that, we did see some big rigs driving it. Some of the parking lots are NOT designed for big rigs like ours. Yes, Old Faithful has plenty of room but the parking lot at Fishing Bridge Visitor Center does not! Fishing Bridge gas station was just big enough for us though and the price of diesel was no more expensive there than in West Yellowstone!Some of the side roads make it very clear that big rigs (RV's and coaches) are NOT permitted but there were a couple that we found not marked that in our opinion should have been! Those are:Artists Paintpots on road from Madison to Norris. We had a hard enough time finding a space for our truck the day we were there. Had we had our fifth wheel with us there it is highly likely we would have got stuck as vehicles were parked everywhere. Can't imagine what it would be like in the summer!Midway Geyser Basin. Once again this place was PACKED! There were a lot of coaches in there and it would have been a nightmare for us to find a spot so look carefully before entering as you can see the parking lot from the road. It may be easier for you to park in the parking lot to the south of Midway and walk from there. Other than those observations, Yellowstone is accessible to big rigs. For those just in cars please note that there are NO shuttles like in some of the other national parks. Yellowstone is VAST and thus you do need your own mode of transport whilst there. Be prepared to slow down frequently for other vehicles who are slowing to view wildlife etc. There are many pull-outs on the roads so plenty of opportunities to get out. Walking trails are abundant. Go enjoy yourselves!","September 26, 2017",~~ Big RIG friendly for the most part! DON'T miss out! ~~,58,"Branson, Missouri",5

Yellowstone National Park,"I was part of a group tour through Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park. For both tours we used AllTrans and our tour-guide was Jessie O'Connor. Jessie O'Connor was an excellent guide! He was very knowledgeable and friendly. Two things that impressed me about Jessie was his excitement about the places we were touring, and outside of his job, he personally goes and visits the places he shows us. Also, Jessie was familiar enough with the areas that he could tweak the tour if a road was closed due to snow or take back-roads to a less crowded area and still get us just as good of a view. I would highly recommend him as a guide to anyone looking to take a tour of Yellowstone or Grand Teton National Park.As far as visiting Yellowstone itself, I would recommend taking at least two days. One day to tour the Upper Loop and another day to tour the Lower Loop of Yellowstone. This allows you to visit most of the main attractions. Secondly, some of the places have steps or dirt paths and may not be the easiest to use if you have a stroller or very bad knees. For example, the path to the Grand Prism Hot Spring is a dirt path going up and down hills whereas the area around Old Faithful is flat and well paved. The accessibility varies on the place. It is also important to note that, not all of the attractions have a restroom available. So if you have smaller children it is important to plan your ""comfort stops"" carefully. Grand Teton National Park seemed much easier to me as far as walking goes. The walking distances to the attraction appeared to be much shorter. Since most of the stops have dirt paths, it's still not the easiest place for a stroller. However, a tour of Grand Teton National Park can be done in one day.  Again, you need to plan your ""comfort stops"" since there isn't always a restroom available.Lastly, unless you are hiking up to Specimen Ridge (in which case you need proper hiking attire) you should be able to walk all of the places in both Parks with a good pair of running or tennis shoes.Overall, both Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park are beautiful places and I would wholeheartedly visit both National parks again.","September 26, 2017",Tour of Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park,2,"Wilson, Wyoming",5

You will see amazing and beautiful hot springs and colorful pools. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone has a waterfall taller than Niagara Falls. Fun Paint and Mud Pots bill away creating funny burping sounds, and yes, foul smells as well! This park has it all! Go to it but don't just watch Old Faithful erupt - take it all in.

Yellowstone National Park,"We drove four hours from Idaho Falls, meandering scenic byways through the Wyoming wilderness en route to Yellowstone's south gate. We battled unexpected sleet, hail raining from the sky, and a sudden snowstorm to finally reach the gate. To our great surprise, the road was blocked by a park ranger's SUV, and the entrance gate was closed at 5:30 pm.We scrambled out of the car toward the ranger to inquire what was going on. She said the gate was closed until further notice due to a car accident on one of the passes, and extremely dangerous driving conditions caused by 17 inches of snow the prior day. The plows hadn't been able to get through, and they were actually evacuating the park. People could get out, but they couldn't get in. The ranger told us that the east gate was also closed and that, if we wanted to drive four hours back in the direction we'd come from, the west gate might be open. She said we could check conditions the following morning ... maybe the park would be open again. I was appalled that people who'd parked their RVs at campsites in the park couldn't get back in to retrieve them until the gates reopened. They had to find hotel rooms outside the park. We drove three hours to Riverton to find a hotel because everything was booking up immediately when local hotels found out Yellowstone had closed the park. And hotels were doubling and tripling the price of rooms due to sudden demand. Nice - taking advantage of travelers in a difficult situation.I was extremely unhappy that Yellowstone management doesn't have enough consideration to use warning signals 20 miles south of the park that alert travelers in advance about closed roads and gates. That type warning system is used all over Wyoming to notify travelers when roads traversing higher elevations are closed due to bad weather. A national park service should certainly employ the same system as a courtesy.When we checked Tuesday morning, all the gates were still closed due to more snow, and snow was forecast for Wednesday and Thursday. We didn't have four days to wait around to find out if conditions might improve by Friday, so we never did get to see Old Faithful.This is my second miss. Forty years ago while driving a hundred miles north of Yellowstone, we didn't have time to veer off the route to visit the park.

I was lucky enough just as we entered the park to see and Osprey/Eagle flying with a fish in it's talons, a very lucky encounter indeed. We did see bison, mule deer, elk but sadly no bears. Every day is a different encounter or experience. The only complaint I have and this is not Yellowstone's fault as they have speed limits posted everywhere are the inconsiderate drivers that want to go faster than the posted speed limits and intimidate you by driving very close and pushing you along.

The fact that there are barely any animals because of the massive amount of cars let in every day. We ended up talking to someone who had been there before and he said this amount of traffic was pretty regular in summer. Other than a check off the bucket list, I really wouldn't recommend Yellowstone. Its sad because it was always somewhere I wanted to go and it really disappointed. Every single worthwhile geyser has about a thousand people around it and a gridlocked parking lot. This place is known for animals, yet all you see are Bison cause other animals have left. While you're driving, you will be in constant traffic just to finally arrive at the problem: a bunch of idiots who have pulled over on a narrow stretch of road to take pictures of a single elk. If you want the nature without the people, really check out Highway 93 between Jasper and Banff, Alberta, Canada.Finally old faithful. It really is amazing. The force with which the geyser shoots is amazing. I would recommend walking to the other side as there is way less people and you can enjoy it much more. Anywhere in the park is better if you just get off the road for 5 minutes or so, it cuts the population down by 95%.","September 21, 2017","holy traffic, whats the point",65,"Vancouver, Canada",2

Yellowstone National Park,"Literally amazing. 5th time in 22 years and it keeps it's magic every time. Where else can you see real wildlife not behind a bar or a cage. It's so spectacular. This year we took a 19 year old from Brooklyn, New York and he kept asking before the trip why do you love it so much. He didn't ask that after - he saw and loved it just the same. Yellowstone Forever.","September 20, 2017",Favorite Place on Earth - not kidding,20,"Aurora, Colorado",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Call for a free map and newspaper to be mailed to you before you go. Call the geyser eruption prediction line and take the board walk around Old Faithful for an even closer view of a geyser erupting. Take the scenic one way drives. Stay in the budget cabins at least for one night each at Lake Yellowstone and Old Faithful to get an early start and parking. Stay in Gardiner for 1 night (in between cabin stays) to remind you of a real bed and to get a jump on Mammoth Hot Springs parking. IMHO at the very least 4 full days for drives, short hikes, main attractions, and a quick drive through the Grand Tetons. On your 4th night get a room in West Yellowstone to get out of the park and rest up for your drive home. MOST OF ALL if you are impatient, have road rage, and don't like crowds don't go, stay home or go somewhere else. You will not be received well as witnessed in the park.","September 19, 2017",Awesome Mother Nature,29,"Wiesbaden, Germany",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Unbelievable national treasure. The three days we were here it was 70 degrees down to 32 degrees. It was sunny, it rained, it snowed, and also some sleet and we enjoyed it all. Very clean park. We saw many bison, some elk. Moose have been gone since 1988 wild fire. My favorite areas were the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, Artist's Paint Pot, and Mud Volcanos. We did not get a great view of Old Faithful because it was so snowy. Worth spending 2-3 days or more here. We saw almost all the areas, except Mammoth Springs because roads were closed. Bring layers of clothes. We had to buy sweatshirts and jackets for September travel. Enjoy!","September 19, 2017",Pristine and beautiful national park,45,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Yellowstone National Park,"As we end our trip of Yellowstone National Park in Montana we begin our Yellowstone National Park trip in Wyoming. As was in the Montana part the Wyoming is just as beautiful. The Caravan Tour bus drove along the Yellowstone river and you could see people in Kayaks and other types of small boats. Some were fishing, some were just paddling along with the current because it was a beautiful to be on the water. No one was swimming or in the water, it was too cold to be in it.As we traveled along we spotted so many animals that are native to the area but a lot of time their not visible. We saw Bald Eagle, Sparrow, Bison (in fact one was walking in the middle of the road right next to our bus) all traffic was stopped on both sides of the street until it decided to go on the grassy area. Our wonderful tour director Barb Weis told us that it doesn't happed too often, but when it does we're on their space and they have the right of way for as long as it takes. Traveling on we also saw Elk, Deer, and several other animals in their natural habitat. After quite a long ride (you can't go very fast it's only a two lane road) we came to the hotel we would be staying that night and the next one also. It was the OLD FAITHFUL INN. It is so awesome the wood came from the trees in Yellowstone, and it's unique to see. It is right by the OLD FAITHFUL geyser. Such a terrific tour.","September 19, 2017","SO BEAUTIFUL, SO MUCH TO SEE",50,"San Diego, California",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Don't rely on staff/rangers to tell you the truth. We went to the Mammoth Visitors Centre and asked if all the roads were clear as we wanted to go to Cody, Wyoming. We were told yes and showed the best way to go. 1 Hour later we came to a road closure, so that was 2hrs wasted. We found out later that there were signs stating that the road to Norris was closed. But those signs were before the Visitors Centre and of course we didn't know where Norris was. All staff/Rangers should know on a daily basis which roads are open and which are closed. We continued on our way and as my wife is disabled a lot of the lookouts and features were not accessible. Didn't see Old Faithful as we ran out of time. Very disappointed in that and the park as a whole. On a better note we did see deer, buffalo and elk on our travels.","September 18, 2017",Watch out for road closures.

Yellowstone National Park,"I have been going to Yellowstone for many years. I remember when the elk were all over the hotel grounds. Then they introduced the wolves and after years the elk are again wild and there is a better balance in nature.It is a wonderful place to embrace nature. My one complaint would be too many people. Between West Yellowstone and Old Faithful you have city traffic, bumper to bumper. When you pull into areas of interest midday, good luck finding a place to park.Mornings are wonderful because people arent moving around yet.The saving grace for the park is that it isnt open year round, so it has time to recoupe from all the people.","September 18, 2017",Best Park,14,oklahoma,5

They some cool trails and camping available in park but you need to make reservations year in advance to get a spot same with the hotels they book up quickly . I found that out . I went through the east entrance and out the south . It is about a 2 hour if not longer drive to the next entrance. Traffic is unreal . But so much to see .

Yellowstone National Park,"Well. the reviewers didn't like my first review. So I'll give it one more go. Yellowstone has signs and rules to not go over fences, to stay out of prohibited areas. Those rules are to protect people from dying or getting hurt. But people go against the rules all the time. Why? Do not go to yellowstone at the end of summer. It's brown, there is little water in the pools and pots and mud holes. The colors are not there because of that. Don't go to yellowstone if there are fires in the area. The smoke fogs up everything and gets in the eyes. Grand tetons were completely obliterated because of the smoke. Don't go to yellowstone when it's unseasonably hot. The animals don't come out when it's hot. We were blessed with a buffalo walking on the side of the road/on the road/next to our truck. That and color was all I wanted to see. Remember to not fill up your vehicles tires when they show low in the park. Cold air does that. When you fill them up, they have a tendency to explode when you are on the highway we were told. It did not happen to us. The speed limit is anywhere from 35-45. Sure there are speeders, but there are also people that are going under the speed without animal or vegetable reason. If you want phone connection, verizon works, att does not. Other than the spots on the road where my phone connected while driving along. Sites are _very_ far apart from each other. With traffic, it takes forever to get somewhere. With little to no water in the attraction at the end of summer, it makes it pointless. I did expect green. It's high enough. I didn't see green, til the Teton area. Everyone said 'labor day is the worst time to go'. It was not. There were people there, sure, but it wasn't as crowded at people said it would be.

Yellowstone National Park,"I had never come here as kid, so I had no idea what to expect. Was OK with the geyser basins areas and the West Yellowstone entrance. Nice and flat, wide open. Some areas - near the South entrance and from Canyon Village up to Tower-Roosevelt, almost had me in tears I was so scared. The roads are narrow, NO shoulders. One wrong move and 'Voop!' off you go into the canyon/gorge. The South entrance one almost had me in tears. My husband zoomed our SUV into the turn-off area so fast and jumped out to take photos, saying how 'Cool' it was. I took a quick glance out my passenger window and I just saw eternity at a bottomless gorge loom before me. Get me AWAY from the edge! I had had this same feeling on the road to Hana back in the 80's. The drive out, I was on the 'inside' - mountains. But on the drive back....sheer cliff drop-offs. I was in a panic then and all of that came rushing back to me on these drop-off areas in Yellowstone. The little guard rails were a joke. Bumper-height. Plus there were NO guard rails at all in many areas. Ugh. HATED these areas of the park.","September 12, 2017",Scary drive in some sections of the park!,58,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4

The abundant geysers, including old faithful are to be seen to be believed. I am glad I have ticked off Yellowstone from my bucket list! We stayed in Holiday Inn, West Yellowstone. During the three days, we managed to see 90% of Yellowstone's main attractions. One tip- see mammoth springs from the road which lead to its top- you get a complete view without climbing up the hard way. Dont miss the grand canyon of yellowstone with its breathtaking waterfall. Álso, firehole falls was lovely. The grand prismatic springs was an awesome sight. There is a trail that leads to a birds eye view of the spring. We did not take it but I think is is worth it. We saw a number of bisons...but do be careful with children...the bisons appear docile but there are warnings everywhere..Be prepared to walk a lot but it is really worth it.

The turnouts are well placed and most major sites are accessible by a drive and a short walk. But definitely take the time to do a lengthier hike into the woods and mountains-you'll get a better feel of the park than from driving and parking over and over. We went in early September, and the parking lot crowds were reasonable. We were always able to find parking. Going early (before 10), and late (after 4) definitely helps for less crowds.

The parks mantra is ""let nature take its course"" in some areas however this makes the park hugely unnattractive with large swathes of dead trees which had been the unfortunate victims of fire.

While the drive was a bit long it was good ""family time"". We expected, and weren't disappointed, with the large crowds. It was August and everyone was getting their last vacation of the summer in before back-to-school. But if you manage your arrival and departure times it is acceptable. Biggest issue were the folks who felt is was ok to just stop in the middle of the road to be pictures of a buffalo or elk. Not sure what they were thinking - I guess the didn't give a rip about the issues they caused for others. Facilities in the park were good. Food was generally ok...not great.

We waited inside the visitor center because it was cloudy and rainy, but the rain stopped just before the geyser erupted and we were able to go outside for great views. The eruption typically lasts for about a minute, then the crowd moves on.

I highly recommend that, or try camping in different places. Many people rent an RV and use that for camping. It gets cold at night, so bring warm gear. Even if the park is the size of a small State you will find many great places to shop or eat in a restaurant and even a chain of gas stations. I highly recommend the ranger talks.

Yellowstone National Park,"Our 1st visit to YNP the 1st week of July was awesome. Difficult to describe it in words. We came in through the north entrance after our start in SW Missouri, via I29, I90, stopping at Sioux Falls, the Bad Lands and Mt Rushmore. We overnighted in Livingston, MT, about an hour away, to ready ourselves for our first day in Yellowstone. Gardiner would have been a better overnight stop, but all the hotels were full. The plan was to explore the northern part of the park, as we made our way to our next hotel in West Yellowstone. We wanted to see Fort Yellowstone and Mammoth Hot Springs, Tower falls, Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Norris Geyser basin, Gibbon Falls and the Madison river area. We spend quality time at each of the 1st 4 sites but had to skip Norris and Gibbon Falls. The Canyon takes a lot more time that one anticipates. There are at least 3 main canyon areas to park at and explore. It was getting late and everyone was tired.We stayed 3 days 4 nights in West Yellowstone. This was a perfect launch spot for dividing the rest of YNP into 2 sections for 2 days of discovering and sightseeing and then drive down to the Tetons and Jackson, WY for the 3rd day. I booked hotels too late to get room inside the park and around the Jackson area. But West Yellowstone, although a tourist trap, has lots of restaurants and shopping to offer so it turned out to be a good base. Some people say Gardiner at the north entrance is the best to stay over, but to see all of YNP, the West Yellow base continues to be my preference. I think you end up with less driving time. Cody in the east also seems too far away as a base. Most of the popular thermal features seems to be on the west side of the park. Make reservations in Oct the year before if you plan to go during the next summer. What we should have done is spend the 4th night in the Teton National Park area somewhere and save on driving time, because we were going back to Oklahoma via WY and CO anyway. But it worked for us. On our way to the Tetons, early morning and back to West Yellow, late pm through the park, there was an opportunity stop at spots along the way in YNP that one may have missed due to the crowds or running out of time.We successfully explored the Upper, Mid and Lower Geyser Basins on day 2, you can cover it in 1 day and spend quality time. On day 3 drove past Lake Yellowstone, through the Hayden Valley and as far into Lamar Valley as time allowed before turning back to West Yellowstone. The Mud Volcano area is on the route and we saw lots of Bison and Prong Horn Deer, but zero Elk in the valleys, hills and wet lands and 3 days in a row we saw no bears anywhere in the park.Definitely get to the popular spots early before 10 am as others suggest. The parking areas at The Black Sand basin, Biscuit Basin, the Grand Prismatic Spring and the Fountain Paint Pots are extremely small. The park seriously need to increase the sizes dramatically. Between 11am and 2pm vehicles were parked along the road for at least a mile or longer and people just had to walk. The next day we saw the rangers put more logs out at illegal parking spots, but people just found other illegal spots to park. We got to Old Faithful at about 9am and were lots of parking.We never got “stuck” in traffic anywhere. It was just really busy and parking is an issue. So just get an early start.","September 4, 2017",Another one of the bucket list for us too,22,,5

Yellowstone National Park,"We spent two weeks exploring Yellowstone and the adjacent Grand Teton Parls. Yellowstone is astonishing and other-worldly. The thermal features are incredible and the wildlife is unbelievable. There is no where else like it in the world.Be prepared to get stuck in traffic jams caused by bison and other wildlife. Frankly, cars will all stop as soon as anything marginally larger than a chipmonk is spotted! Try and keep calm, and go with the flow. There is no rush in Yellowstone.Distances are significant, speed limits are low (45 and 35mph typically) and jams are common. Construction jams will drive you mad (they have to resurface the roads during the summer months, and they actually close one lane at a time for up to half an hour). So plan for a long journey time, wherever in the park you are going. You cannot sensibly tour the northern loop, if you are based in the south of the park, and ditto for the southern loop if based in the north. Unless you really are into very very long days. I suggest two bases are required. We used West Yellowstone, and Colter Bay (Grand Teton) from where we explored most of the park.The biggest tip - go early in the day. Ideally get through the park gates before 9am (if you are not based inside the park) and get to your chosen attraction before 930 or 10am at the latest. Otherwise, arrive after about 330pm, when things get quieter again. In betwen these times, the place is manic, and you will struggle to find parking, particularly at Old Faithful, Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth.The queues at the Park gates can be very significant. Like half hour waits or more, if you leave it until 10am or so.","September 3, 2017",Amazing Place to Visit,78,"Leicester, United Kingdom",5

Yellowstone National Park,"What an amazing National Park. Words nor photos do this part of our beautiful Country justice. We were only there for two days, which isn't enough time but still we were able to see alot of wildlife and most of what the park had to offer. We camped near Yellowstone lake and that was a great location centrally located between the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Kids enjoyed doing the Jr. Ranger program.

Yellowstone National Park,"As the 'Beautiful America' pass was only $20 more than the entrance fee for Yellowstone and Grand Teton, we bought the pass allowing us access to all National Parks and Forests for a year. It was totally worth it. The drives around the park are stunning, and you really need a minimum of two days and possibly three to see all of the major features. The southern loop is the busier, as it features most of the hot springs, acid pools and of course Old Faithful. Parking is ample and boardwalks make it a safe environment and an accessible one for strollers and wheelchairs in most cases. There are signs everywhere telling you not to stray from the boardwalks due to the fragile and thin crusts in many places, meaning you could readily fall through if you step on the wrong place (it seems nobody told the tourists from a certain country, who rampaged everywhere with blatant disregard for their safety or for anyone trying to take a picture without them in it). The northern loop is quieter, and the better option for seeing wildlife. However, if a bison or elk strays near to a road, be prepared to not be able to move for 15 minutes, as traffic simply stops to look and nobody can go anywhere. Highlights for me were the Yellowstone Canyon, West Thumb, Biscuit Basin, Midway Geyser Basin and Washburn Hot Springs.There are several villages (plus the centre at Old Faithful) where food and services can be obtained, including fuel. Road signage is excellent. As with pretty much every public space in the western world these days the park is jam-packed full of RVs (camping cars) and these can get very tiresome at times, blocking up the pull-outs you want to get into to take pictures, and driving and parking very slowly, but there's little you can do about it. Even the roads and car parks saying ""No buses, RVs or trailers"" were full of buses, RVs and trailers, so it's just a fact of life in Yellowstone. Woe betide you if you try to park your car in a bus space though - that's simply not allowed!","September 1, 2017",Outstanding and totally worth the entrance fee.,219,"Agde, France",5

Yellowstone National Park,We spent a week in the park and visited all the main attractions of the park. The various museums are full of information and explanations. The walks to the various geological features are great. Visiting these main attractions requires lots of driving at 45-50 mph and sometimes slower when cars ahead of slow down to admire the views. You can also get slowed down and completely stopped waiting for the wandering buffalo in front or facing you to decide if and when he is going to get going away from the middle of the road.

Driving to all the park attractions can be challenging with thousands of other park visitors with their own agenda. Be aware of traffic jams caused by wildlife. Don't be in a hurry here because the bison, bears, and elk will keep you in check. The attractions here are like being on another planet with geysers, bubbling mud, and Geothermal activity under your feet. You have to remind yourself your on top of an active volcano. The biggest disappointment was traffic. The park is not equipped to handle the parking volume. Therefore cars just randomly pull over everywhere which damages the delicate ecosystems.

Yellowstone National Park,"We love National Parks and our country has so many marvelous ones; each a unique treasure. This was our first trip to Yellowstone and we loved the interesting diversity of the Park. Geysers, lakes, waterfalls, hordes of animals, prairies, canyons, hiking trails; there is something for everyone.I've read horror stories about the traffic but we didn't experience problems at all. We stayed in the Old Faithful area. We walked Geyser Basin early, saw the early show of Old Faithful (between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM, there were only a half dozen people watching Old Faithful). Once we accomplished that we headed out before the buses and day trippers arrived. Each day we explored a different part of the park and walking trails to take in the sites. If you get an early start, you can see everything without crowds and traffic jams.Only once did we come around a bend and ""traffic"" was at a standstill. Turned out to be only one car waiting for a huge Bison to cross the road! That was our ""major"" traffic jams but we got great pictures!We packed our own lunch so we didn't have to fight crowds at lunch. Old Faithful lodge has a wonderful general store where you can grab things to take. We would pull off in secluded picnic areas, often being the only ones in there and then hiked some of the trails near the picnic areas.I read before we left that only 10% of the people visiting Yellowstone get out of the car or bus. What a shame! Get the GypsyGuide download to explore the park and get out of the car. You won't see traffic jams on the beautiful trails and there are plenty of easy trails.By the time we would head back to our Old Faithful cabin in the late afternoon, the traffic we saw was going in the opposite direction of us because we got a head start.Don't stay away from this wonderful park because you think it might be crowded. Of course, it gets crowded; it's Yellowstone in summertime! Just be smart, plan ahead, do some of the tricks I mentioned above -- and enjoy this glorious Park!","August 27, 2017","A ""MUST SEE"" NATIONAL PARK",159,"Green Valley, Arizona",5
Yellowstone National Park,"We spent 8 days exploring Jackson Hole, Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone Park. This is not the easiest trip to plan so I will describe what we did and some alternatives for those on tighter budgets or with fewer than 8 days. Our family is generally fit and consisted of 2 adults and 2 children (12 and 17 y/o).Flying to the area is not easy since there are few flights and they are expensive. We flew to Jackson Hole. Cody would have been cheaper but is less convenient since it is located about 80 miles east of Yellowstone.We spent the first 3 nights in Jackson Hole at the Alpine House ($337/night) in a kitchen suite that was fine, but tight. Breakfast was great, the location was ideal with lots of parking and the owners were very nice (loaning us a Coleman ice chest and bear spray for the week at no charge). The only nice lodging in the Grand Teton (Jenny Lake Lodge) is way overpriced and restricts your ability to do things outside the park. It is a short drive from Jackson to Grand Teton and staying in Jackson is your best choice. We spent our first afternoon shopping for groceries (Albertson's is the only good grocery store you will see on the trip), exploring the small town of Jackson and getting settled. Dinner was at Café Genevieve which was good. That left us 2 days to explore Grand Teton which is very different from Yellowstone in that there is very little infrastructure (bathrooms, picnic tables) and the hikes are mostly ½ day or full-day. You need to bring lunch and carry adequate water.One full-day hike should include a boat trip across Jenny Lake, short hikes to Hidden Falls (easy) and Inspiration Point (moderate uphill climb) and then a long hike as far as your feel you can into Cascade Canyon (fewer hills) where you can have lunch. This is the best of Grand Teton and absolutely beautiful.We elected to take a 3:30 PM to 7:30 PM white water rafting trip with dinner (Mad River Rafting, $96/person) down the Snake River. You spend about 2 hours on the water which included level 3 rapids which are fine for inexperienced rafters. A barbeque dinner is waiting for you about half way down the river on a cliff overlooking the river. The food was good and our family had a great time.The final ½ day hike we chose was a Taggert Lake and Bradley Lake hike. There were some moderate hills, but the scenery differed from the Jenny Lake hike and there are beautiful spots along the lakes to have lunch. The hike to Amphitheater Lake is reported to be nicer, but it is a much more strenuous all-day hike. Death Canyon was another good option, but the scenery was similar to the Jenny Lake hike.We left 4 nights for Yellowstone Park. You need to reserve your rooms 6-12 months in advance. The park is huge and it is best to stay in 2 different locations to allow you to better explore the whole park. If you reserve late, take the best room you can get and check the web site 1-2 times per day since people often release rooms (no wait list). The main roads in Yellowstone are shaped like a figure 8 with the entry from Jackson to the south (6 o’clock on the lower o of the 8). The map of the park on the web site is unreadable, but once you reach the park you can get a free full size version which is legible and indispensible. For the first 2 nights, we had 2 rooms at Canyon Village (built in 2017, $163/room/night) which is modern, simple and well located (in the right middle of the 8). For the final 2 nights we had 2 rooms in the west wing of the Old Faithful Inn (8 o'clock position on the lower o, $263/room/night) which was dated, but adequate with an unbeatable access to the geysers. The old Faithful Inn has a spectacular log cabin lobby that takes you back to the 1920s. You do have other choices at Old Faithful which include the OF Inn Old House (log cabin construction with no bathrooms in most rooms) and the OF Snow Lodge (somewhat more modern, but less conveniently located and not nearly as grand a lobby).On day 1, we drove from Jackson Hole to the South entrance and counter clockwise (up the lower o of the 8) to Canyon Village. We explored major sites include West Thumb geyser basin, the Upper and Lower Falls and the Grand Canyon. Depending on how much time you have and how long you choose to make your hikes, you can often add many ""lesser"" sites that you come across while driving. Most of these sites are just a few steps from pull offs (parking lots with bathrooms) on the main road. For dinner we traveled 30 minutes south to Yellowstone Lake Hotel, one of the 2 great dining rooms in the park. Xanterra operates all the major restaurants in the park which are staffed with seasonal chefs and employees and their access to supplies is somewhat limited. Given the limitations, the food was good and fairly priced ($115 with tip), but not what you would expect from such a grand location if it were located outside the park. Be sure to make your dining reservation as soon as possible.One day 2, we drove from Canyon Village counter clockwise (up the upper o of the 8) with a stop at Tower Falls to the Lamar Valley. As your drive through the park, you will encounter unexpected pleasures such as a hill of gorgeous wild flowers or animals that require time to photograph (I hope you have a better camera than your iPhone) and enjoy. Our plan was to drive 30 miles into the Lamar Valley and then turn around and drive back. We pulled over to observe so many animals, we only made it 15 miles before having to turn around. We saw about 1000 of the 5000 bison (do not call them buffalo) that live in the park, numerous pronghorn (antelope like creature), deer and elk. Back on the main road, we continued counterclockwise past Wraith Falls and Undine Falls to Mammoth Hot Springs. This small town has the only free internet access in the park at the information station. Much of the afternoon was spend exploring the hot springs and terraces which were gorgeous. For dinner, we headed north (from the 12 o'clock position of the top o) to the small town of Gardiner, MT for supplies at Gardiner Market (a small, overpriced grocery store) and dinner at simple, but very good Lighthouse Restaurant. After dinner, we returned to the main road and drove counterclockwise back to Canyon Village. The scenery throughout Yellowstone is spectacular, but there are few major sites along these roads. It will get dark before you make it back to the hotel, but you will not miss too much.On day 3, we began with a 1 hour horseback ride at the Canyon Village corral. This was a waste of a 1/2 day and the only major mistake of our trip because: 1) we were very uncomfortable in saddles of these horses; 2) you are not allowed take water or cameras; 3) you only ride in single file; and 4) the scenery was no different than that seen on our hikes. After recovering from our ride, we checked out of the Canyon Lodge and continued counterclockwise (around the lower o) exploring major sites including Norris Geyser Basin, Artists Paintpots, Firehole Canyon Drive (with a nice swimming hole), Lower Geyser Basin and finally Firehole Lake Drive. It was late, so we left the other major sites for day 4 and drove to the Old Faithful Inn (8 o'clock on the lower o). For dinner we ate at the dining room at the Old Faithful Inn, the other great dining room in the park. The meal was only fair to good, but reasonably priced ($110 with tip).On day 4, we explored the geyser basin around Old Faithful. We started on Geyser Hill behind Old Faithful, returned in time to watch Old Faithful erupt (which it does every 96 min or so), had lunch and then continued down the boardwalks to other geysers and pools in the Upper Geyser basin around the hotel. Our son had our hike planned out so we arrived at Grand Geyser (the largest), Daisy Geyser and finally Riverside Geyser in time to watch them each erupt. This was one of the highlights of our trip. You should not short change yourself by not leaving enough time to experience the geysers. By mid-afternoon, the family was ""geysered out"" and we drove clockwise (up the lower o) and stopped at the major sites we had missed on day 3 including Black Sand Basin, Upper Geyser Basin, Biscuit Basin and Midway Geyser Basin. We drove back to Firehole Canyon Drive and stopped at the swimming hole so the kids could enjoy the river water and cliff jump. For dinner, we drove out to the west exit (along a road from the 10 o'clock position of the lower o near Firehole Canyon Drive) to West Yellowstone. Dinner was at the Buffalo Bar which was fair and I would look elsewhere for dinner in the town. The road to the west exit does not have any major sites and it is not a big deal if it is dark when you pass through.On our final day, we drove 2.5 hours from the Old Faithful Inn back to Jackson, did some t-shirt shopping, had lunch and then headed to the airport for our flight home.We drove 600 miles, spent $7000 ($2400 flight, $2700 hotels, $350 car+gas, $1000 food, $400 rafting, $400 other) and all of us had a great vacation. You know it was a great vacation when no one can agree on the best day of the trip: my favorite was the one in the Lamar Valley and at Mammoth Springs; my wife's favorite was the full-day Jenny Lake hike; my son's favorite was the day at the Old Faithful Basin watching geysers; and my daughter favorite was the one we went rafting and spent a 1/2 day hiking in Grand Teton.If you wanted to eliminate 1 day, I would skip the rafting and 1/2 day hike in Grand Teton. If you wanted to eliminate a second day, I would try to fit the Geysers and Basins near Old Faithful into 1 day (of course skipping horseback riding).If you are on a tighter budget, you can drive (rather than fly) and camp out (rather than stay at hotels). All the hotels in the area are overpriced and it is hard to save much money by staying in the towns near the park. You could consider a night in Gardiner and the final night back near Jackson to save a little.","August 27, 2017","Jackson, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks in 8 days (1 week, 7 nights)",10,"Oak Brook, IL",5

Yellowstone National Park,"I had the pleasure of visiting Yellowstone after years of this gorgeous park being on my list of things to do. Let me tell you; it was all I thought and much more!!! We were there for 3 days and I highly suggest taking at least 3 days at Yellowstone in order for you to be able to see all the amazing places that the park has to offer. If you can, take a week and you can then do it slowly and take more time but 3 days is probably good if you don't have a week. We started in the West Entrance and did the loop from South to North. For us it was perfect and allowed us to see everything we wanted. We camped at the park while there. Park is huge and we did not want to be driving in and out of the park on a daily basis. I know there are some lodges and hotels at the park as well but for most you need to make reservations way in advance and they may not be at everyone's budget since prices tend to be on the high side. Be aware that at some of the camp sites (private camp sites that have nice bathrooms and some even have showers) you need to make reservations prior to arriving and at others (the park's camp sites) is first come first serve. If you go to the ones with no reservations be there early (and I am talking about 6 or 7 am early) as most camps are full by 10 am and the most popular ones are full by 8 am. Yellowstone is roughly 2 million acres and much of it is completely wild and not accessible to the public but the loop allows to see a lot of the different landscapes, basins.. hot springs.. valleys.. canyons.. etc we saw lots of wildlife specially bison, even a black bear!

I thought ""old faithful"" was a bit anti-climatic. It is a hole that shoots hot water a few seconds and it is finished.

Yellowstone National Park,"Entered the park by the south entrance. Waited in a line of traffic 1-mile long to go through entrance gate. After we got into the park we saw a sign indicating ""road construction flagman ahead. We drive for about 2 miles and traffic came to a complete stop for 25 minutes. Finally, traffic started to move and we drove for 4 miles very slowly and traffic came to a complete stop for almost 10 minutes. Still we didn't see any flagman or road construction. When traffic finally started to move, we drove for about 5 miles before we saw a flagman or any sign of road construction. We then drove about 3 miles on 1-lane road as the other lane was closed. At the end of the construction zone, traffic coming from the opposite direction was stopped and backed up for 1 1/2. No alternate route is available once you enter the park, all the turn-outs were closed, so no stopping for traffic to pass or taking a break or even turning around. Once pass the construction zone we encountered more stopped traffic and endless delays because parking at attractions is not adequate to handle the volume of visitors. People parked along the roadside on the narrow 2-way road causing traffic to stall, visitors crossed traffic between cars causing further delays. One guy parked with the rear 1/2 of his vehicle jutting into the roadway near ""Midway Geyser Basin"" causing traffic to back-up for 1 1/2 miles on either side to maneuver past his vehicle. No Park Ranger or Park Police presence seen along the roadways enforcing the parks posted signs which say, ""NO PARKING, NO STOPPING, NO WALKING ALONG THE ROADWAY."" We visited the park near the end of the season, I cannot imagine what type of nightmare this place is during peak season. Park management can be faulted with this fiasco. With the volume of visitors to this park each year, parking lots should have been enlarged to accommodate the masses. Park Police should enforce the park laws consistently so everyone can enjoy the park, not just the visitors who don't obey the laws. One guy from California license plate 6TNZ601 stopped to see some animals on the side of the road causing a traffic backup behind him for 5 minutes while he and his passengers enjoyed viewing the animals even though a sign right next to his car clearly stated, ""NO STOPPING.""

Yellowstone National Park,"I have always enjoyed visiting the National Parks in the US, and top of my list has always been Yellowstone. So where else would we go for our 20th wedding anniversary?Within minutes of entering the park we spotted bison, elk and bald eagles. I was in raptures, being a nature lover and avid conservationist. One bison appeared from behind some trees right next to us, which scared the life out of me, as you are advised to keep well clear of them as they can be very aggressive. I was just recovering from all this when we spotted a wolf on the edge of the tree line. WOW! My life was now complete! What a treat! So you would really think that my first half an hour of Yellowstone was so monumental that everything else would be a disappointment. Absolutely not. This is now officially my favourite National Park. I never thought anything could top Yosemite, but in my opinion this does.The park is vast, and so the different landscapes are very varied. Obviously if you go to the really well known areas such as Old Faithful, it is absolutely heaving with tourists. But there is so much space, it is easy to escape the hoards of visitors with some amazing hikes and drives.The mountains, the lake, the views – all exceptional. I managed to get some amazing wildlife photography of bison, elk, deer, eagles, etc. Sadly, we never did see Yogi, or any of his family.We stayed at the Old Faithful Inn for one night, which means once the park closes to the public, everywhere is much more peaceful and sedate. Although I have to say the hotel was very expensive and a huge disappointment (see my review).We visited in late May/early June, so all the newborn bison and elk were everywhere. Fabulous.We had 2 full days in the park which is woefully inadequate.

Yellowstone National Park,"Finally decided to go to Yellowstone for vacation as part of a big trip including Mount Rushmore and pikes peak. Very beautiful park. Temperature was in the low 80s so not too warm. Make sure you bring snacks and water to help you get thru the day since you'll do a lot of walking and exploring in the day. Old faithful schedule is located in the visitor section so you know when the next eruption will occur. Park is big so you can't do it all in a day. If you're thinking of going, do it. The park is busier in the beginning of august due to summer vacation for kids coming to an end and trying to get that trip done before school.","August 16, 2017","Beautiful park, wish I had another day to explore",14,"Merced, California",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone has a very short window during the year when you can easily visit. But it won't be easy if you don't plan well. The crowds during July are heavy; even finding parking at the popular sites can be challenging at best. To get the most out of your visit, plan.First, we started our day early -- like on the road by 7 am or earlier. This gave us more opportunities to see wildlife (as they, too, get up early) as we made our way to whatever section of the park we had planned to explore that day. By starting early we also had fewer crowds to deal with and better parking opportunities.Second, plan your day excursions so that you can return to your ""base camp"" by mid-to-late afternoon. You really do NOT want to get stuck in the traffic jams on the narrow, two-lane roads that are in the park. Especially when everyone is stopped for a lone buffalo crossing the road. Once back at your base camp you can plan your next days' excursion, relax, or whatever.Third, look for opportunities that will take you off the beaten path and away from the crowds. Yep, crowds are pretty much unavoidable, but if you've got the right vehicle, you might find less-traveled roads that offer interesting sights outside those that everyone else is going to.Finally, stop when you can to take in as much as you can. Yellowstone is BIG. We saw a lot in our week there, yet did not see it all. We very much enjoyed and savored everything we did see, and look forward to our return.","August 14, 2017",Plan your visit to improve your experience,140,"Atlanta, U.S.A.",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is so big and overwhelming that you need a plan. You shouldn't just drive each loop and pull over at each overlook. First, you need to get there early. It takes an hour from the park entrance to get to any of the big attractions such as Old Faithful. Call the Visitor's Center beforehand. They can tell you within ten minutes before or after when Old Faithful will erupt. Note that there are no effective signs directing you to the Visitor's Center once you are in the Old Faithful parking lot. Read all you can to know what is at each pullout. For example, we were told that Meyer Basin was a must see. So we went and walked a bit up the boardwalk and saw some thermal pots. Later I found out that you need to walk one mile up the boardwalk to see the biggest and most colorful of the thermal pools.We saw a number of bison, which was memorable. The animals are more active early in the morning - another reason to get there early.It is certainly worth a trip. It is very busy and hot in the summer though.","August 13, 2017",Have a plan,6,,5

We saw snakes, bears, buffalo and other wildlife all by the roadside so no need to hike to see them and all the magnificent geyser sights and wonderful.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone National Park should be on every American's list of places to visit. There are many breath taking sights and the wildlife is abundant. There is just too much to do and see, so you will need more than one day. Do your homework and take time to plan your visit. Check for road closures or construction beforehand to minimize delays. Pack a cooler and enjoy any of the pull off picnic areas. They start to fill up as early as 10:30. If you like to fly fish there are many accessible spots for beginners as well as experienced fisherman. Remember this is the real outdoors and not an amusement park!! Arrive very early and you will see wildlife. If you can't arrive early stay till late afternoon and early evening to catch a glimpse.

The Yellowstone paper had tips to make the trip through more enjoyable. One tip: Pack your Patience!!! There are a lot of people trying to see the same thing you are and it's not always easy to find a parking spot, a clear photo shot, or a place on the boardwalks around the features.

Yellowstone National Park,Due to long winters the park is mostly closed from October to mid May. That means everyone has to cram in there during 4 short months. There are long lines in restaurants and long car lines to get into parking lots to look for a parking place to get out and see some of the attractions. But it is worth all the aggrivation one you get out and see all the marvels nature has to offer. Get an early start to avoid the long wait to get into the park.

Yellowstone National Park,You can't go wrong with a trip to Yellowstone. The best time of year to go (I think) is August or September during the bison and elk rut. You are almost always guaranteed to see the bison but the elk are more scarce. I have seen several moose near Gros Ventre but even those are few and far between. No matter what the views are awesome. Just make sure to plan your trip accordingly to make sure to take in the views of the many lakes and the mountains.,"August 7, 2017",National Park Tour,19,"Stinesville, Indiana",4
Yellowstone National Park,"We visited Yellowstone on a family trip recently. It is a beautiful place, lots of geysers, hot springs and geothermic features. There are a bunch of American bison just wandering around, crossing the road in places and lots of elk, too. It is beautiful getting to view Nature up close. Just make sure that you don't get too close--these are wild animals, after all, and not tame house pets! We were fortunate enough to be able to view a black bear (from a safe distance), and we were able to get a bunch of good pictures with the zoom lens on our camera. Old Faithful and Midway Geyser Basin are super crowded, it's true, but totally worth seeing. I loved Grand Prismatic Spring in Midway Geyser Basin; it and was a highlight of the trip for me. So many different colors: blue, yellow, orange, brown. It was surprising to feel the heat coming off it blowing across at us, and then suddenly feel an intense cold. We also saw Mammoth Hot Springs (North Entrance) as well as the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone and we did the hike back to see Morning Glory Pool. (There were plenty of other geysers and pool and things to see along the way to see Morning Glory, as well.) There is some walking involved, but my 86 year old mother was able to do some of the shorter hikes with us, even though she couldn't get to the Morning Glory Pool since it was a mile long hike. We had about 4 days total to spend in the park. Not enough, but at least we were able to see some of the highlights.","August 6, 2017",Yellowstone National Park is Not-to-be-Missed!

Yellowstone National Park,"This park is absolutely amazing. I've never seen so much beauty in one place - and so much diverse beauty. Parts of the park looked like the forest, parts looked like Tahiti (Yellowstone Lake), parts looked like the prairie (Lamar Valley), parts looked like the moon (Mud Volcano), etc. We spent two full days in the park - one day doing the lower loop and the other doing the upper loop. The lower loop was my favorite of the two. But, in both loops, my favorite sections were the valleys - both Hayden and Lamar Valley. It was in these valleys that we saw an abundance of wild life. We saw black bears, elk, bison, and even a wolf! We're from Southern California - and we just don't get to see this in our everyday lives. To have a place like Yellowstone, where this exists, just makes me want to support our national parks as much as possible. These parks represent the ruggedness and beauty that is America! It is awe inspiring and a 'must visit' park at least once in every American's life!My favorite spots were the valleys (mentioned above), Mud Volcano including Dragon's Cauldron, Yellowstone River and Otter Creek. I'd recommend taking a full day to do a loop. We did the lower loop clockwise, ending the day at Old Faithful. The geysers on this loop are just awesome! We did the upper loop counter clockwise ending at Mammoth Hot Springs, which is also incredible!One thing that bothered us was how close people got to some of the wildlife. These are wild animals that must be respected. There were countless times when parents endangered their children by getting out of their cars and walking up close to get a good view of the animals. Be in awe, but be smart. Stay in your cars!","August 6, 2017",Best National Park we visited on our 5-Week Western US Trip,66,"Los Angeles, California",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Biggest tips for visitors to Yellowstone:- Set your expectations appropriately. It is pretty but (with the exception of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone) is not an ooooh aaaah majestic place, as Yosemite is.- the geothermal action is the unique part of it. You won't see this much of this anywhere else in the world.- Prepare to drive a lot- it's a very vast park- PLEASE add on Grand Teton National Park if you possibly can (it's very close) That will give you enough oohs and aaahs to last a very very long time","August 5, 2017",Set your expectations for Yellowstone appropriately- and go to Grand Teton too!,326,"San Francisco, California",4

Yellowstone National Park,"We had to cut our visit short, and ended up seeing some of the highlights of Yellowstone in a single day. (I had planned on another half day, continuing down to Grand Teton National Park for the remainder of the day, but had to move on.) While I can't really recommend any single point of interest as a standout, I could say that there were quite a few I enjoyed equally well. The driving can be tiresome (since we came in the east entrance), but the views are spectacular. Seeing Lower Geyser Basin, Old Faithful and Mammoth Hot Springs were among some of my favorites there. As others have stated, many of the national parks are busy in recent years and Yellowstone was no exception. However, we had little trouble finding parking at the attractions we visited, so, no worries there. We had stayed in Cody due to the closer towns being outrageously expensive, but I would say that if you really wanted to see all of Yellowstone, two or three days would probably cover most of it, and you'd want to stay in the park or at one of the nearby towns despite the cost, just to save a couple hours of driving time each day.

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone is one of those places that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. Be warned that this is a BIG park. The distances between interesting sites may be somewhat far apart. The first day we put on 200 miles looking at everything in the park to see what we wanted to explore more in detail the next day, In order to escape the crowds come early. As you explore the park you will see various wildlife but the Grisly was elusive. When you come be sure to bring lots of water. It seems that in the parks altitude (around 8000) you get very thirsty. I would also recommend bringing a picnic because Restaurants are few and they are very busy. Travel to restaurants outside of the park is prohibitive because of the distance. For example our motel was in Cody. That means that we had a 50 mile trip to and from. You do save in motel rates by staying a little bit further out. If you happen to have problems walking or are in a wheelchair you will find that some of the sights are difficult or impossible for you to see. Some things can be seen from the car. Some of the trails around exhibits are narrow and have no handrails and are somewhat steep if you are in a wheelchair. The park does offer wheelchair rental but you have to but down a $300 refundable deposit or Credit card. Even if you have some disability making walking difficult go and see as much as you can.Yellowstone climate is a little bit cooler than the surrounding area due to its altitude. We were there in the later part of July and the Mornings the temp was 50. It does warm up, but it may be smart to bring a sweater. We found that the most annoying part of the park was the number of tourists. If you come to a roadblock it is most likely that a Bison or other wildlife was close the road and both lanes stop to take pictures. We even saw people run out after the Bison to take pictures. No smart. That is what they make telephoto lenses for.This was the first time we visited the park and we will be back.","July 31, 2017",Everyone must see this park,28,"Brainerd, Minnesota",4

Yellowstone National Park,"My wife and I spent three full days and an afternoon in Yellowstone – and this I think was adequate time for visiting most of the major sights. We stayed one night in Gardiner near the north entrance and three nights in West Yellowstone at the west entrance.In West Yellowstone, we stayed at the old Madison Hotel Motel on Yellowstone Avenue. On the website, the hotel names itself ‘the Historic Madison Hotel’ –and this does sound more attractive than the immediate impression of something old and worn down. The look of the main building both outside and inside is dominated by old fashioned shiny and brownish fir logs and the carpets on the floors are so heavy that it feels like you are walking on a century old layer of thick dust.Compared to the marvelous attractions of the Yellowstone park itself, the tourist towns of Gardiner and West Yellowstone have hardly any charm whatsoever. Both have decent restaurants and good hotels – but other than that streets are overflowing with shops selling endless piles of T-shirts and tourist junk.When you are visiting Yellowstone, it is highly recommended to spend as much time as possible in the park. This is what you are here for. If you have a hotel room in one of the border towns you will only need these spots for places to eat and a place to sleep.It is important to be well prepared if you want to be sure to see the major sights. Lots of travel books are available and I have looked at many of these – but one in particular is highly recommended: “Yellowstone in a Day” published by the Yellowstone Association in 2014 and revised in 2016. The book describes 3 days in the park (plus some special interest trips) and it has excellent maps, photos and short descriptions of each location including suggested time required for the visit. This book is a jewel for any tour guide or attentive visitor – and it costs only $9.99.Yellowstone is very much worth a visit. The park has a lot of unique sights – including impressive geyser basins, rushing rivers and waterfalls, deep canyons and plenty of wildlife. During our visit we saw lots of bison plus some elk, a moose with her calf, a black bear, a coyote and a grizzly with her two cubs.The park area is huge but often quite crowded near the largest attractions, e.g. Old Faithful, the Grand Prismatic Spring and the Artist Point overlooking the magnificent Lower Falls of the Yellowstone. In some places, it is difficult or even impossible to find parking – and someday soon I believe access during high season for private cars will have to be restricted as it is already in other national parks like Zion and Yosemite.Yellowstone National Park is wonderful and a visit is highly recommended.","July 31, 2017",Yellowstone in three days,175,"Aarhus, Denmark",5
Yellowstone National Park,"What can you say about America's oldest National Park and the first National Park in the world. Yellowstone has so many world famous natural attractions and it is a must visit. There is just so much to see and do in the park, and there are so many unique and amazing things to admire. At 2 million acres, the park is huge and features several areas including Old Faithful, Lake Yellowstone Village, Canyon Village, Madison, Norris, Mammoth Hot Springs, Tower-Roosevelt, and West Thumb-Grant Village. These areas can be far apart and often require several hours of driving. Expect crowds in the summer, especially at the famous attractions such as Old Faithful and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, etc., but all of the tour buses and the vast majority of people will stay along the roads and in the developed areas. Even short hikes of 2-3 miles round trip will get you away from the crowds and bring you to some beautiful sights that most people will never see. Plan to spend as much time in the park as you can. You won't run out of things to do. There is just so much to see. Make your lodging and dining reservations as soon as possible, and for many places, this needs to be done at least a year in advance. Finally, there is no wifi available in the developed areas except at a very few locations, and there is very limited cell phone service, even at the resorts and visitor centers.

Yellowstone National Park,"If you are going to go to Yellowstone, you need to do your research well in advance to get the most from your trip. It is a stunning, eye watering geological creation of biblical proportions.Plan your trip and route in advance, yet be flexible as the needs arise. If you are considering staying in one of the park’s lodges, you will need to book well in advance, (probably the year before), but avoid the refurbished Canyon Lodge. Even if you cannot stay in the park, many motels, hotels and inns are available outside the park and the distance is not an issue in the mornings, if you start early.Admission to the park is charged by vehicle. We choose to buy an annual National Parks pass for our car (transferable between cars) at $80. This was a bargain, allowing us to visit more natural wonders on our three week road trip. As you enter any of the gates you are given an information sheet and map by the friendly rangers. Once inside call at any of the information stations for up to date information and advice. Here they were able to tell us when and where was the best chance to see bears and wolves and all the other creatures that live in the park.The best time to see wolves is dawn and dusk. Take binoculars or a scope with you because they will probably be very distant. However some animals, like the bison will be right next to you and your car. Look out for cars slowing or parked up for wildlife viewing opportunities.If you are going to be hiking in the park consider having bear spray, just incase. You can hire this in the parks trading stores, or you can buy it in local supermarkets outside the park at about $50-55.There is gas (petrol and diesel) available through out the parks along with garage workshops. You can buy food and drink at the parks trading posts, or eat at the lodges.Parking at the sites of interest can be slow because of the number of visitors. There is no one organising parking and it can be difficult. Because some car parks and turnouts fill up quickly you end up waiting, or parking on the road verge and walking. When planning your day allow extra time to park up. The main attraction for us at Yellowstone was ‘Old Faithful’ , this has a large car park, so large that after three or four hours looking around you can easily forget where you parked.There was no signal on my UK cell phone and the whole time we were there we had no mobile coverage. At the parks information centres there was some (slow) free wifi available.If behind one of the larger RV's it can be slow, especially if they stop to take a photo. Also give cyclists (there are a lot) a wide berth when passing. In July we had temperatures of 100+, so sun cream and hats are a must. We stocked up with a large two dozen pack of water before entering a the park at a supermarket.Yellowstone is a must if you are anywhere near, A great place for young and old alike.

Yellowstone National Park,"This is an amazing park, but also one of the most popular with huge crowds. Like any of the parks, just hiking a mile you can lose most of the crowds. Whatever you do, MAKE RESERVATIONS. Especially if you are camping. This would have saved my family time although what we did worked. All sites fill up quickly every day so we stayed inside the park once and outside once. The park is HUGE so either travel within and make reservations on both sides or centrally for the entire stay. We spent 2 full days in the park and were able to cover all paved roads, many overlooks and a few trails. We stayed just outside the park to fish and whitewater raft with Montana Whitewater as well, which was a nice change of pace. Have to see Lamar Valley in the evening on Saturday!! Amazing site of bison herds, bear and much more. There are who many beautiful sites to see here, you could spend a week if you can stand the crowds. We couldn't. Like all, arrive early to get a spot. MAKE reservations in Yellowstone if you know you are going 6-12 months in advance (however soon is allowed, do it!). It saves some time.

Yellowstone National Park,Magnificent and beautiful. This place has everything for those who enjoy the outdoors. Lots of animals and breathtaking views. We traveled here with two small kids and they both had a great time. The only drawback is the amount of people. Large crowds gather at animal sightings and popular attractions.

Drove in to the Fishing Bridge visitor center, just missed a grizzly sighting on the way - cars all over the place, crowd starting to break up. Caught an excellent safety brief from a Ranger at the visitor center, good timing to start our visit.Drove all over the park, saw all the wildlife & sights. Traffic can be difficult, especially if some bison walk in the road!Major construction between Mammoth & the south, that was fun.Take the little one-way side visit roads where you can; they are totally worth it. One place we caught a geyser eruption and we were the only folks to see it; everyone else was on the main road.Had dinner at the Old Faithful Lodge; walked in, got a buzzer, got a seat about 45 mintues later. Got to watch the geyser while we waited, cool. Dinner was good, and very reasonably priced!Do your research before you go, know what you want to see, plan extra time for traffic and for stopping & seeing.We spent a good 24 hours total in the park, and probably need another 12-20 hours to really feel like we saw it.","July 26, 2017","2 nights, 1 full day, 2 half-days - almost enough time for an overview",194,Mons,5

The loop roads are clearly signed and there are areas to get out and walk around the geyser trails or at the Grand Canyon area to see the waterfalls. If you head out early morning or late afternoon you will see plenty of wildlife. The Hayden Valley area is the best to see wildlife, especially Bison.

Yellowstone National Park,"We were blown away by our first trip to Yellowstone. We didn’t do a ton of research but navigated things okay overall. The Park is laid out in service hubs – Mammoth, Old Faithful, Canyons, Lake Yellowstone, etc. Each hub has a gas station, store, and other amenities, which was good to know as we drove up from Jackson Hole and panicked when we realized we were entering the park on less than a ¼ tank of gas! The Park is really about seeing the sights – all of which require driving, so you do spend a little time in the car. We spent one day driving up along the west side to see as many geysers as we could. The Grand Prismatic was simply breathtaking; Artists Pots was very cool; and Mammoth was amazing. By the time we got back down among the peak season crowds for Old Faithful, we weren’t all too inspired to wait around for it to blow. We stayed at the Lake Cabins and loved it (see separate review) and spent the second day hiking up Mt. Wabash, which was a good 2,500 foot ascent over 8 miles. We’re in generally good shape and did it in 2 hours up, ½ hour up top for a snack, and 1.5 hours down. It was basically a dirt road for much of the hike, which made it easy to navigate, but it did have some incline to it that may slow some folks down. The views are worth it for sure – what a great day hike. We then spent the afternoon driving to the various spots on the North and South rims of the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone to see the waterfalls. Again, the views were amazing and the power of the lower and upper falls were inspiring. I can see why Yellowstone is the granddaddy of all the Parks – absolutely a bucket list majestic experience for all of us.","July 25, 2017",Bucket List - Check!,53,"New Hartford, New York",5

Yellowstone National Park,"This is definitely a place everyone should visit. We went in June. It was a little cool but not uncomfortable. Of course, visit Old Faithful, but then drive the loop road, go see the mud pots, the prismatic springs, the water falls, and the other geysers. There is so much there and in the surrounding areas. Not much internet service and some of the bathrooms along the ride are very rustic. We spent 2 days there and enjoyed it all.","July 24, 2017",Historic and Unique,39,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Yellowstone National Park,"On our way home from Michigan decided to come here. A very long wait to get in the park. We were at the park most of one day. We saw a ton of bison, elk, rabbits, deer, and antelope but no bears. I must say people are really dumb getting close to animals to take pictures ...Not smart at all. We got to old faithful just in time for it to erupt. A must see. There are many places where they have geysers which smell like sulfur, but to cool to see. They have a few large general stores with souvenirs and food. It's definately a very busy park. And I think everyone should see it, so many breath taking views throughout. Mountains , lakes, streams, geysers, hot springs, trees and wildlife galore. ","July 24, 2017",A must see,67,"Bentley, Michigan",5

The long slow drives between popular attractions made it hard on the little guys, 10,4 & 2, but they thought it was cool to see old faithful and the paint pots. We didn't see any animals until we were leaving the park that evening, when we came up on a buffalo along the road. So i was pretty bummed out about that. Next time we go we will plan on staying a couple days so we can go slower and see more. Hopefully the animals will make an appearance next time.","July 24, 2017",Fun for the family,0,,3
Yellowstone National Park,"We visited the park in early June and were treated to a late spring snowstorm (amazingly beautiful as we can't visit in the winter,) a measurable earthquake (while at Old Faithful,) gorgeous spring flowers, minimal crowds, minimal traffic, and animals galore (we saw everything except a wolf.) We stayed for a week and the biggest thing people who have never been there before should know is that the mileage between various areas should be measured in hours - not miles. Traffic, even minimal traffic is slow and when the bison are on the road, forget it. It's a parking lot.Take time to plan where you want to go, and what you want to see before you go. For example, it took us 3.5 hours to get from Old Faithful area to Mammoth Hot Springs area. We stayed at the Fishing Bridge campsite and visited southern areas of the park, and took a day trip to the Great Teton NP - totally worth the time! Next, we camped in Gardiner and saw some of the Northern sites.Wear good shoes as you'll walk and walk and walk - everything feels uphill there! The danger of bears is very real there. This midwest family bought it on Amazon for half of what they charge in the park. You really do need to have it with you to feel safe walking trails or hiking - and not back country hiking.Bring binoculars, invest in a good touring book, don't rely on your phone's GPS as nearly everyone loses their signal there and without a paper book/map, you'll drive aimlessly. Bring bear spray, patience, a lot of water, food from outside the park if you can, and charger/batteries for however you're taking photos. My husband had a hiking stick and it made a huge difference for him and helped us stay out on the trails longer. For our family, it was a trip of a lifetime and we enjoyed every day there!!P.S. Back up your photos as soon as you get home - it'd be terrible if you lost half your trip photos because your phone died one day for no reason - as me how I know;(","July 23, 2017",A Bucket List Must-Do,48,"Chicago, Illinois",5

We slowed down our schedule so that we hit the major sites (Old Faithful, Artists Point) late in the day before sunset. We stayed in Silver Gate which is the least-used entrance and gave us early morning access to Lamar Valley and it's wildlife sittings before the mid-day rush. Also, if there are any activities you have your heart set on, be sure to check out the park website. Several of our favorite spots were closed this year because of the large amount of snow melt. I can't say enough about how friendly and knowledgeable all the park rangers and staff are, and the xanterra staff at the shops and restaurants are also very friendly.

Yellowstone National Park,"Most people would rate this as one of the outstanding global attractions and I would concur with this view. I have written separate reviews of some of the key attractions in the park, but I'm using this review to give a general overview. Firstly, as many have said, you need at least 3 days in the park to do it justice. The $50 week pass, including entry to Grand Teton, is exceptional value, as there are no additional charges once inside. Staying inside the park will cut down driving times, but the costs for this are very high, so you need to balance cost against convenience. Canyon would be a good option as it is very central. We stayed at Grant, which was convenient for the Geysers, but at least a 4 hour round trip to the Lamarr Valley.As many have said the crowds in Summer are huge, but the park manages to absorb these except for the parking lots at the major sites. Visiting these early or late in the day and using the intervening period to go hiking, cycling or similar would make good sense. As soon as you venture away from the attractions, crowds thin out rapidly. Early morning also offers superb light for photography. We reached Hayden Valley around 7am and there was little traffic. Our only disappointment was that despite all the mentions of bears, we saw not a hint of one! Overall An unforgettable experience.","July 21, 2017",Six Star Attraction,211,"Krakow, Poland",5

Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone National Park is a must-see for everyone at least once in a lifetime. There are so many incredible places within the park to see, and the wildlife viewing is unparalleled anywhere else I have been. One nice thing about the park is being able to tailor your visit to the amount of time you have to spend. There are several camping areas for those who want to take their time and see as much as possible. Or, you can select a few highlights and see them in about 3 or 4 hours.Those wanting to camp should make reservations well in advance. We've had travelers tell us they book their campsite for the following summer at the end of their trip during this summer! If you plan to visit the park during the summer, which is the best time to see everything, be prepared for frequent traffic jams and slow-downs at the more popular attractions like Old Faithful and the Upper/Lower Falls. Wildlife in the road also cause frequent stops, and in these instances, patience is advised. We have seen people nudge their vehicles forward to try and get the animal to move, and not only is this dangerous to both the animal and the travelers, but it is also illegal and can carry hefty fines. Best rule for animals in the park? Look but don't touch, and adhere to the park rules regarding how close you should get to them.Careful planning and patience will make a visit to Yellowstone memorable and fun. From Yellowstone Lake to the Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful to the Volcanic Mud Pots, the Hayden Valley to the Upper/Lowe Falls, the experience of visiting this majestic place is truly unforgettable!","July 16, 2017",One of the world's most incredible places!,16,"Rock River, Wyoming",5

Our other stop was the Grand Prismatic Spring. A thunderstorm was just passing through, so there was a lot of steam raising because of the rain-which blocked some of the view.

Yellowstone National Park,"Like others, this was a bucket list trip ... and well worth the time & money to plan. Planning this trip was no easy feat, but I came across a few sources that proved to be quite helpful:(1) ""Dirt in my shoes"" by Ash - - Ash is/was a park ranger and has great detailed itineraries you can purchase for a very modest price. I ended up purchasing the 4 day Yellowstone itinerary for $20. Suffice it to say, it was worth every penny. It got you to the top locations and in a logical order. Highly recommend!!!(2) GyPSy Guide App - - purchased the Yellowstone Grand Teton combination for $9. It was awesome ... since it's based on GPS, you don't need cell service :-) The guide gave us lessons in history, geology, etc. He told you when to pull off, when to turn, etc. We used the app in conjunction with the 4-day itinerary. They worked great together.Hotels:We moved every couple of days so we were closest to the park entrances (West, North and South). If we were to do it again, I would greatly consider staying centrally within the park (but you need to book 1+ years in advance, we started planning 6 months in advance). I would also recommend renting an RV, seemed to be the easiest way to move about as long as you had a car in tow. Either way, see below for my hotel stays:West: Yellowstone Under Canvas (Montana) ... see details under separate reviewNorth: Yellowstone Basin Inn (Gardiner, Montana) ... see details under separate reviewSouth: Jackson Hole Hideout (Wilson, Wyoming) ... see details under separate reviewActivities:In addition to driving nearly 1,300 miles viewing Yellowstone & Grand Teton, we did the following activities.(1) 1/2 day Wildlife Safari in Grand Teton ... see details under separate review(2) 1/2 day Whitewater Rafting Snake River ... see details under separate review(3) 2 day overnight kayak trip Lewis/Shoshone Lake ... see details under separate reviewThe overall trip was awesome - gorgeous in every sense, but very tiring.

Yellowstone National Park,"Words can't describe the expansive beauty of this natural wonder. Anyone and everyone should experience this at least once in their lifetime. It's a peaceful reminder of what North America used to look like before it was settled. The terrain, views, wildlife, and flowers are like nothing you can experience by reading a book, or watching it on Nat Geo. Kids loved it, but traffic can be crazy. My only complaint would be the loads of tour busses filled to capacity with visitors, each carrying selfie-sticks. Somehow, it just sours the mood that is so captivating within Yellowstone. Find a non - crowded road, and just stop, park, and take it all it. Lastly, the park restaurants were surprisingly clean, and affordable. Food was aveage","July 7, 2017",Bucket List Family Trip,14,"Austin, Texas",5
Yellowstone National Park,"Yellowstone was sensational. It is so many world's in one huge park. In the Old Faithful area, see the Lodge with great views of the geyser which spouts off about every 90 minutes. Walk the surrounding area to see many other geysers on the Geyser Hill Loop,and north of there, the Grand Prismatic Spring in Midway Geyser Basin. See the smoking Fumaroles, paint pots and many steaming pools. I loved the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The gorgeous height and colors of the canyon along with the gushing waterfalls is awe inspiring. The canyon is 23 miles long and can be viewed at various places such as Lookout Point andUpper Falls Viewpoint. Lake Yellowstone is one of the largest alpine lakes and is excellent for fishing for trout. The Lake Yellowstone Hotel overlooks the lake and is a lovely spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner. If animals are want you want to see, drive through the Lamar Valley to see bison, antelope and wolves. The Mammoth Hot Spring area is known for its natural terraces where mineral waters create beautiful colors and shapes in the terraces. Elk may come to visit in the area as well. Pick up a park map which will help you to navigate the loop roads. We spent two full days there and we were able to see most everything. Allow more time if you want to do more serious hiking. They had a lot of snow there this winter which made the Cascades and River even more beautiful and powerful. The wild flowers were in bloom and the weather was cool but perfect for hiking and sightseeing.","July 5, 2017",World of Wonder,11,"Media, Pennsylvania",5

Spent 3 full days driving the park to look for animals, and all we saw were a few elk, lots of geese, and a bazillion Bison! Now, we loved seeing that massive creature. But, not seeing even one bear in all those many hours at Yellowstone was hugely disappointing, especially for the kids! There was beautiful scenery to be viewed and appreciated by the adults.

Yellowstone National Park,"While entry roads were closed for 2 days due to snow and avalanche danger, we did get in the day we planned. The park feels prehistoric even today...it's field after field of geysers and pools, wildlife and mystery. While most people come just to see Old Faithful, it certainly isn't the most spectacular nor grandest of the geysers, it just has the most frequent/regular eruptions...about 17 time in 24 hours. But...please don't scurry away after seeing it.Take the time to walk through the entire park (2-3 hours) and be amazed how there are steam plumes everywhere, the earth seems so alive, and almost on the brink of total eruption...however, walkways and boardwalks make it easy to get up close and personal in safety. Check with the visitors' center or National Parks automated phone info to see when the other geysers are likely to erupt....they'll give you times and say ""plus or minus"" 30 to 90 minutes. Plan on being at the sites the 90 minutes before, because in our experience they went off early. Grand Geyser is the most powerful and angrily shoots 200+ feet into the air. Castle Geyser reminded me of Trevi Fountain, and erupts for over an hour, the last 40 minutes of which is just steam. We bundled up and went out for the 8:45pm viewing on night and were rewarded with Grand going off to our left, Castle in front of us 10 minutes later, then Old Faithful going off to our right another 10 minutes. AMAZING!Buffalo truly roam everywhere, and come close to the Lodge, parking, and geysers. Please remember they are wild animals, and don't let your kids wander closer than 75 feet the way one lady did with her 2 or 3 year old - she was within 10 feet when a passing ranger warned her away!!Enjoy, it's magical.","June 21, 2017",Old Faithful is just the beginning of great,76,Florida,5

We explored the route from the east entrance to the Lamar Valley where it's been referred to as the Serengeti of Yellowstone. We saw hundreds of buffalo on this trip and several black bear and elk. The real treat came when we least expected it while we were on our way out of the park back through the east entrance...a large grizzly sow with her cub hanging out on the hill top about 200 yards from the road in an area across from Sedge Bay where we've seen no wildlife in the past.

We enjoyed many geyser and hot spring sites ending the afternoon at Old Faithful. Timing for Old Faithful is crucial, check with the cafe's eruption chart & don't be surprised if it is a few minutes + or -. Day 2 was spent sightseeing the Northern area's.

Then there is wildlife to see: buffaloes walking down the middle of the road between the stopped cars, elk curled up on the lawn near the visitors' center, grizzly bears and black bears grazing in meadows near the road. My favorite was Beryl Spring, right next to the road - turquoise water boiling madly while steam roars out of two vents above the water. Mammoth Hot Springs area was another weird and wonderful place. The Old Faithful Lodge is an amazing log structure - the lobby atrium is huge. You can see most of the sights in a couple of very long days but better to make it three or four leisurely ones. It takes a while to travel through the park, and there are lots of places to pull off to enjoy the scenery.

Let me also say if you can pick up a copy of a book sold at the park ""Yellowstone in a Day"" It has I think every sight and how to get to them as well as things to do together, like near each other. It's $10. At the park. We joined Yellowstone Forever and became a supporter and one of the benefits is a discount at the stores, a tee shirt and a nice booklet. This is one of our (USA citizens) national parks and we should do whatever we can to make sure it's here forever. I won't go into each sight, but spectacular and outstanding goes a long way to describe this park and to see the animals roaming around is breathtaking. To stay in the park you need to make reservations a year in advance. We spent 4 nights and 5 days and saw a lot but you can stay much longer because you never run out of things to see and do.

It does not take as long to drive around it as you might think, though that could change if traffic is bad. Be careful driving along the winding roads, esp. at corners, because often you come around and there is traffic stopped to look at wildlife! To see: there is the waterfall, the geysers, esp. Old Faithful, which is within walking distance of the parking lot for it, wildlife, including bears, streams, a lake, tree covered mountains. Places to eat along the route, gift shops, and even a grocery store, near the North End.

We have hiked several times in the Alps in Switzerland and traveled all over Europe - and never realized such a treasure was right here at home.We spent two days in the Teton National Park and Yellowstone national park. We stayed in Jackson Wyoming and drove to Yellowstone each day.While Jackson is a nice town with a lot going on in the evening - next time I would stay at one of the lodges in Yellowstone to cut back on the time it takes to traverse the Park. The first afternoon we spent in the Teton National Park and it is incredible. This part of the Rocky Mountains is massive and majestic. We stopped by the information desk at the gift shop near Snow Lodge at Old Faithful geyser and asked one of the employees for help to determine our best routes to get the most out of our time. She was so helpful and gave us recommendations on places to go. Yellowstone is so large and the speed limits are very slow - you spend a lot of time driving so we wanted to make the most of the stops. We traversed almost the entire park in about 12 hours in two days. I have included the map we used with notes. The small loops that are side roads are all well worth the stops.If you're a senior (62 or older) you can get a senior lifetime pass to any national park for $10 and it admits your entire car. We entered the park this morning at 6:30 am and the gatekeepers were not there and notes on the window permitted vehicles to enter at no charge.The geysers are incredible - over 300 in Yellowstone (almost half of all in the world), saw old faithful erupt twice -the canyons and waterfalls are incredible and the lakes are unbelievable. The terrain is so different on each area that it's unbelievable.If you haven't gone - go! Plan to spent a lot of time driving - speed limits range from 25 mph- 55 mph with very few at 55.

Yellowstone National Park,"A must see destination for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. Very pricey to stay in the many lodges within the park during season but it must be weighed against the vast distances to be covered within the park if one chose to stay outside. many many natural wonders to see... at least a 5 day visit to do justice to see the whole park.

Yellowstone National Park,"I had been in Yellowstone thirty years ago. The memories had faded so it felt like it was time to see it again. I wanted to go say hi to my old faithful friend. I had forgotten about the animals, though.We ran into three buffaloes walking down the street like if they owed it. Then we saw a heard of elk, and wild turkeys. Then we saw two bears within 100 of the road. BIG bears too! The Revenant size bears!We saw one white wolf, eagles, more buffaloes, deers everywhere and an assorted number of furry creatures that we never figure out what they were. There are no fences, and these animals have NO fear of humans, which is awesome. They don't mind the people getting down of their cars to take pictures and they just keep doing what they do. The old faithful Inn and all the vents and pools of volcanic water boiling and stuff was just icing on the cake for me in this trip. The wild animals made it all worth it.","June 6, 2017",Another bucket list destination,28,miami,5
Yellowstone National Park,"We arrived with a small travel trailer, with a full-service reservation for 3 days. The counter staff put us in G section and said the water line was frozen due to another camper, so no washrooms and no trailer water. They did not offer another section where things were fine. They said that they were working on the water problem hopefully fixed 'tomorrow'. On that trust we paid full price.Each day they said that it would be looked at. Well, it was never fixed and we ran out of our own supply so I asked who appeared to be a senior manager for a credit. She very reluctantly, through negotiation, offered 20% discount. She said she'd do it later on her computer system. I checked my credit card statement later and found 20% for 1 day not three. Needless to say we feel cheated and feel the counter staff cannot be trusted.

Yellowstone National Park,"While Yosemite should have been the first U.S. National Park, this distinction goes to Yellowstone National Park. Nothing can compare to the uniqueness and beauty that is our first National Park. Old Faithful lifted high and long on time. Reservations for camping is a must! Reserve long before visiting the park or expect to camp elsewhere and drive to the park. Food and lodging are readily available in West Yellowstone which is just beyond the West park entrance. There are lots of visuals, visitor centers and wildlife to see. It is slow driving across the park due to speed zones and people stopping to view the many animals/attractions/scenery. As always, the bison were on the road and ""owning"" it. We saw many people attempting to get close to the bison and other animals for photos, viewing and selfies. People should heed the warnings to stay away from all the wild animals. We love this park! A must see for everyone!","June 3, 2017",THE First National Park,16,Somewhere Usa,5

All the visitor centers are nice and clean and have really wonderful people working at them! We did some short hikes to the falls in the canyon area. Trails were great! Mostly we drove around and stopped at most of the major points of interest! Cannot believe the diversity of the land of this park - wide open pastures, snow covered mountains and rocky canyons! It's such an amazing place! Every American needs to bring their family here at least once! And you will have memories that last a lifetime! And don't forget to stop and see all the wildlife! It's unbelievable! We were so lucky to see 2 black bears and a grizzly! Plus we also saw lots of bison, elk, pronghorns, moose and even more! Hope we can return again to this American gem!

We spent three days in the park and a day and a half in Grand Tetons...we should have stayed in Yellowstone. The wildlife in Yellowstone was much more abundant that the Tetons.

Yellowstone National Park,"Push the gorgeous park to the front of your ""Must See"" list. Do not wait! And don't be afraid to take children. We visited in July 2016 and our children were 15, 12, and 8. They all agreed it was their most favorite vacation EVER. And they are well traveled kids having visited Hawaii, Alaska, Costa Rica, Iceland and (of course) Disney World. Also, note that this was a 2 week trip, mostly unplugged from devices. In our current state of connectivity 24/7, this was truly a gift!Things I suggest:Bring a laser thermometer. Just how hot is the surface of that pool of water? Let's find out! The kids LOVED this!Bring binoculars. While elk and bison will practically get into your car, many other animals are (thankfully) a distance away. Wolves and grizzlies come to mind here.Pack warm clothes. It get cool at night! Even in summer.Stay INSIDE the park as much as possible and even change your location every couple of days. Yellowstone is HUGE and you don't want to spend your whole day in the car getting somewhere, just to get back in and drive back. There are several different ""zones"" in the park (Northwest entrance, Yellowstone Lake, Upper Geyser Basin) all with hotels. Stay in them 2 nights if possible to allow exploring in those areas without having to drive too far. I can't stress this enough. Yellowstone does get crowded in summer, but you just need to walk a 1/2 mile in off the pavement to lose many of the crowds. Find those trails and check them out.Visit the more popular sights EARLY or you'll wait for a parking space. We visited Grand Prismatic Spring at 6:30am, pulled right into a parking spot and did the boardwalk loop around the various sights. By the time we left at 7:45, the lot was full and folks were already parking along the roadway.Due to the time of our visit, it was light quite late into the evening....well after 9pm. So don't be afraid to visit things late in the day as well. it's not as crowded and hot, and animals are more active in the later hours of the day.Ask where you can spot the wolves. We stopped at a pullout in Lamar Valley when we saw folks with long distance viewing scopes. Turns out they were the nightly ""wolf watchers"" waiting for the pack to come out for evening activities. It was interesting asking them about their experiences (many come to the park annually for several weeks at a time just for wolf viewing). And folks were generous letting our kids look through their scopes, even though we didn't spot any wolves that time.Visit Grand Teton NP on your way south if you're heading that way. It's also beautiful and a short drive away.Have a great time. We truly fell in love with this park and will certainly be back.","June 1, 2017",Amazing Family Vacation,25,"North Reading, Massachusetts",5

After finding out the major cities in WY are 200 miles apart I found out what the cowboys were up against.We entered the NE entrance after discovering that all the entrances are not opened all the time and had to drive there from Cody (which was a great place to stop anyway as well).The park was great. The open country the animals the scenery and the kids loved it all.We stopped many times along the way to see the sites and take pictures.Finally got to Old Faithful quite far but a must see.As advertised every 70 minutes and wonderful. Plenty of places to stop nearby. We also ate there at the places that were opened. Had a Bison Brat, what was very different but tasty. Unfortunately the trip to the facilities later smelled like it followed me there. I highly recommend this to everyone.

Yellowstone National Park,"Ours was a 5 day trip. The most memorable trip of a lifetime. The Memorial Day long weekend. My husband and I drove from Minnesota.Day 1 - We took a rental car and drove from Minnesota and halted at Rapid City, South Dakota. One our way we saw the Sioux falls, 1880 Town and Badlands. It was a good start. Day 2 - We drove from Rapid City, SD to Cody, Wyoming. We took the US16 scenic drive and it was the most beautiful think we ever did. It was a long ride but very rewarding. I felt like I was in God's paradise. Such was the beauty of the mountains. At one point we saw snow, immediately rain and sunshine all within 30 seconds. We wet quite lucky.Day 3 - we drove from Cody to the east entrance of the park. Another magical scenic drive. We covered the Yellowstone national park in a day. We first saw the black pool, the boiling mud at the entrance of the black pool. Then drove to see the old faithful geyser and took the grand board walk there to see the morning glory pool. On the way we saw many other geysers and thermal pools. It was a 3 mile walk very rewarding. We didn't see the grand prismatic spring as it was too crowded and we thought it's going to be like morning glory so we skipped it. We next saw the fountain paint pots. And then we drove to see the Mammoth hot springs. It was so cool. Throughout we saw many animals along the way like elks, bears, bisons, birds etc. It was the best time ever. We also saw people come with their new born babies, old couples and people in wheel chairs too. They took the trouble to see this natural wonder. It was an inspiration. Once in a lifetime experience. I want to go again. And we returned back to hotel at Cody, WY.Day 4 - Back to South Dakota. I was so excited to see US 16 again but bad luck we took the other route and it was so dry and lifeless unlike the past 3 days of our trip. I was so hurt for not being vigilant. I will also say just because we took the wrong road we knew the beauty of US 16. I still regret missing that road in a matter of seconds. Instead of taking a right I drove straight into the desert I would call it. That evening we saw the cosmos mystery area, Mt. Rushmore and the drive in zoo 'Bear country USA'. It was good. We wanted to visit the Jewel cave one of USA's best rated caves. We went there but we learnt that we need to book in advance. So we missed it.Day 5 - We saw the Wonderland Cave and Reptile Garden in South Dakota and drove home back to Eagan, Minnesota.At the end of all I just realized the ethereal creation of God. We are a tiny speck in front of the huge mountains and thermal lands of Yellowstone. I strongly recommend the US 16 scenic drive from Rapid City to Cody. Do this trip and I'm sure you will make the most beautiful memory of a lifetime.","May 11, 2017",Just Beautiful Memories😊,11,,5

We weren't able to get a room inside the park, so we had to get through in the time we had left before the park closed.We drove thru the south entrance of Yellowstone straight to Old Faithful. We caught a break in that we no sooner parked and walked to the geyser area before Old Faithful began to erupt. We witnessed the entire event without any wait time at all! We then drove northeast to see the upper and lower falls and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. Very spectacular!We were hoping to be able to drive from there out of the park thru the northeast gate, but we had to change our plan as heavy snow was predicted that evening for the higher elevations that we would encounter. So we drove instead to the northwest to Mammoth Hot Springs before exiting Yellowstone through the north gate. We stopped to take a break at Mammoth Hot Springs. As we were leaving the general store, we saw that a herd of moose was making its way across the town square. We hurried and got in our car and watched.

Yellowstone National Park,"Back in the day, when vehicles were less trustworthy than they are now, people used to make long journeys to see the world's first national park - and they hung signs on the vehicle saying: Yellowstone or Bust! It's easier now, thank goodness, and last year more than 3.8 million people made the trip. But not everybody sees Yellowstone at its best, which is what this review is about.It's a common question, ""When's the best time to see Yellowstone?"" For many, if not most people, the answer is: ""When you can."" The park is beautiful and awesome any time of the year, but travel is restricted in winter (Nov-May) and each season has its highlights. What I'm talking about here, having lived in and near the park for forty years, is ""The Best Time to See Yellowstone - Depending on What You Prefer.""For example, if you really want to see Yellowstone at its peak in terms of scenery, then mid-to end of June suits most people. There's plenty of water in the streams and waterfalls, the flowers are coming into their prime, many of the big animals are still in areas where people can see them and the crowds aren't overwhelming. Snow in the higher mountains adds contrast for great photography.On the other hand, if you really want to avoid big crowds then the fall shoulder season, essentially from the first through third weeks of September are ideal. Some park services (hotels etc.) have closed, but the weather is generally good (cold nights, warm days), and there's some fall color around.If your goal is to see as many animals as possible, then you should come early, as in the first three weeks of May. It can be cold and wet, even snowy, but the elk, bison, pronghorn, bears and most other wildlife are still in the valleys where the roads are. This is also the time of the year when the bison have their calves (""red dogs"") and their antics are fun to watch.If you're into wildflowers, the end of June, early July (depending on elevation) are the prime weeks. This varies some year to year.For people who like to fish (license required), Yellowstone is ""catch and release"" territory with a general season from May to September. Best fishing, in general, is May-June, but you have to put up with bugs. Yellowstone is as big as the state of West Virginia. Waters and fish vary with location and season.You can hike in Yellowstone any time or ski in winter. It's wet and muddy in May-June and there may be forest fires and/or smoke to avoid from July - September. Like fishing, where you go makes a big difference in the hiking experience - as well as the season.You'll notice I didn't mention much about July and August. Nothing wrong with those two months, except, there'll be literally about a million visitors each month, it gets hot and dry; and many of the big animals have skedaddled into the high country away from roads and people. But, like I said, you come when you can and ""high season"" is usually a good experience.Finally, there's winter. Not everybody's cup of (frozen) tea; but for others it's the purist, most quiet, most subtly beautiful season of all. If you like to cross country ski or snowshoe, this is one of the great destinations in the country. Most services, except in the Old Faithful area, are closed but gateway towns such as West Yellowstone and Gardiner are active, especially for snow coaches and snowmobiles. I supposed everybody has a favorite season, wherever they live. Yellowstone has great seasons - and to each their own. (Me, I love the fall - no bugs, few people, decent if nippy weather, great scenery.)","March 13, 2017","The ""Best Time"" to see Yellowstone Park",9,"Livingston, Montana",5
