Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This park had us singing. Beautiful walking trails and great drive even though a portion was closed. At this time of year, we had some areas to ourselves. Watching the sunset is now a cherished memory. Be sure to take time to watch the antics of the prairie dogs.","October 16, 2019",‚ÄúWhere the Buffalo Roam‚Äùüé∂,8,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Theodore Roosevelt National Park is not to be missed. Start with film @ visitor center. Loop drive is great and you may encounter close up views of bison. Due to time constraints I was not able to visit the North section. Amazing Badlands views ,"October 14, 2019",Not to be missed,0,,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I have been to Theodore Roosevelt three times now. Every time I go the experience has been unique. There is a variety of landscapes and I always see wildlife. Still haven't seen the elk, but I hear them. You can see a lot of stuff from the car or within short distances from the car. If you want to hike more there are also more lenghty hikes, so really there is something for every skill level.","October 12, 2019",Always Unique,0,"Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Theodore Roosevelt Park was amazing. We only explored one day and wish we had more time to see other areas in the park. It was incredible to see the Bison and the views at the overlooks were grand.,"October 11, 2019",Loved the park!,2,Massachusetts,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a large and scenic national park with bison, deer, prairie dogs in abundance. We did see some snakes also. The area is beautiful and holds a lot of history. There are trails and roads throughout these northern badlands and we liked the vista called Buck Hill. The tiny town of Medora was mostly closed up for the season when we were there, so we stayed in Dickinson. It is well worth the trip. ","October 9, 2019",A beautiful place with an abundance of wild animals,3,"Cottage Grove, Minnesota",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We had the opportunity to tour most all of it and it was enjoyable. We tried not to miss anything. Most all was self guided and the rangers set us up in the trailer to watch the video which both of us thought was good. Would Teddy stay here before the South Park is my question, I do not think he would. I believe he would first stay at the south end where the farming and the animals where probably more plentiful.","October 8, 2019",Rough Rider,4,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Wildlife and wild rock formations are the great attractions of this park. One woman near me said, ""I guess I'll cancel my flight to Mars, because I'm already there."" This was in the North Unit. Walking right through the middle of prairie dog colony on the way to the old entrance was a treat. Best of all was the Petrified Forest, which involves a bit of drive over gravel roads outside the park, but is a real wonderland. Camping was fine.","October 6, 2019","Far away from most things, but worth the drive",13,"Cedar Falls, Iowa",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"It was drizzling most of the time we were there. The sun came out just a bit to see the beautiful canyon rocks of the North Dakota Badlands. It was a pretty drive through the park. We only saw a few buffalo on our drive, that was the only disappointing thing of our time spent here. ","October 5, 2019",Rain or shine,6,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Beautiful visas, but soggy day in Park today. Saw black birds, prairie dogs and bison, but that was it. Boo hoo. Think the critters were hunkered down staying out of the rain. Didn‚Äôt blame them. ","September 29, 2019","Beautiful visas, but soggy day in Park",35,"Los Osos, California",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We didn't expect this. This is a nice park with a lot of wildlife including bison, pronghorn antelope, many raptors and other birds along with Praire Dogs. The Little Missouri River runs through the park. Just off the interstate so it doesn't take anything to stop.","September 27, 2019",Didn't Expect This,160,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We entered the park - which honours President Roosevelt who established the National Park System and also lived for a while in the area - via the Medora entrance. The first stop is the visitors' center, with its helpful Park Service staff, its small museum, and Teddy's log cabin. There is also a movie shown.Our travel experience was strictly by car, stopping at the recommended lookouts with their explanatory signs. We saw lots of prairie dogs and not too many of the other animals inhabiting the park. The visit was still very worthwhile.","September 26, 2019",Worth a visit,357,"Zug, Switzerland",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The south part of Theordor Roosevelt National Park is located at Medora, North Dakota. If you are going west you will get off at exit 27 on I94. Strange exit as it curves to the south as a one lane and goes into Medora. Watch the speed limit. When we were there part of the loop was closed but most of the roadway was open. We saw wild horses, buffalo and a whole bunch of prairie dogs, In fact we saw 3 different prairie dog towns with the last one being the biggest. Those little devils will come up to the car begging from food. Some of them are very fat. There was some color there and the pullouts are well space and large so you can get good pictures. To see the north side, you need to travel toward Watford City, ND. There is no connection between the two sides. be sure to abide by the buffalo petting guide.","September 21, 2019",Two sided park,91,oklahoma,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,I truly enjoyed this national treasure! Roosevelt's vision for this amazing landscape was spot on. I would recommend watching the movie inside the visitors center. ,"September 19, 2019",Road trip,17,"Springfield, Missouri",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My husband and I went to the north unit (south of Watford City) and south unit (near Medora). The south unit is more accessible (along I-94). The north unit is 60 miles farer north along US-85. We spend a half day at each unit. If you have time, I recommend seeing both units. We drove the 14 miles (one way) road in the north unit. The landscape was beautiful. We saw lots of bison, longhorn cattle, turkeys, deer, prairie dogs, a bald eagle and one snake. The visitor center is in a portable building. Restrooms are in a separate portable building next to the visitor center. We watched an informative 15 minute movie in the visitor center. There was not much else at the visitor center. We stopped at all of the pullouts and overlooks. The Oxbow Overlook had a short trail and a gorgeous view of the Little Missouri River. The north unit has a pretty campground and picnic area. There are no hookups. The north unit had fewer park visitors than the south unit.In the South Unit, the main loop road was closed about 23 miles into the park. We drove the 23 miles then returned the same way. We saw beautiful landscapes, lots of bison, pronghorn, wild horses and thousands of prairie dogs. We enjoyed hiking the Boicourt Trail and the short Buck Hill trail. The south unit has a wooded campground and picnic area. The painted canyon is very pretty.","September 17, 2019",Beautiful North unit and South unit. 60 miles apart.,631,"Austin, Texas",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The scenery was nice in the Medora end of the park but Medora is very touristy. So if you want to be entertained Medora is the place. But for my money the North piece of the park is the place to go. In the morning there were few vehicles and many, many bison. But, beware, it was very hot in mid-September.","September 15, 2019",the North part of the park is where to go,0,"Jersey City, NJ, United States",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a beautiful park. We saw a lot of Bison as well as lots of prarie dogs. The loop road has a nice variety of places to get out and see the views.The ""south unit"" is the one accessible from Medora. The North Unit is a totally different entrance that is a significant drive.","September 14, 2019",Beautiful park!,6,"Franklin, Massachusetts",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park," If you are used to Zion, Yosemite, Bryce, etc.. This park is underwhelming. I would not go out of my way to see this park again. I would avoid if it recently rained. ","September 13, 2019",Average National Park,3,"Grand Forks, North Dakota",3
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Road trip! The scenery is unworldly. It is basically the Badlands of South Dakota with way more wildlife. We saw bison, prairie dogs (thousands), wild horses, wild turkeys and mule deer. You really should take the time to see both the north and the south units.","September 13, 2019",Wow!,54,"Alpharetta, Georgia",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Home to just about every prairie dog in the United States. Even the bison got along with them lounging in the middle of their field. Nice places to stop and walk and see some sites better. Road was closed so the loop drive was not possible for the southern tier.,"September 13, 2019",Great place.,37,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a must for those who love our national parks, but enjoy much fewer people/crowds. This place is beautiful. Make sure that you don't skip the North Unit! Caprock Coulee Trail is a must for avid hikers. Beautiful scenery and gives you just enough of a challenge to make it interesting. Also, saw a herd of buffalo at Oxbow Overlook! At the South Unit, as everyone says, don't miss the sunset at Wind Canyon or sunrise/sunset at the Painted Canyon. We stayed at Medora. Nice little tourist town with friendly people. Indian tacos and buffalo burgers...not a real find (skip). Also, if you need a place for your 4 pawed pals that are traveling with you...Boomers Boarding @boomersboarding1(on Insta) in Dickinson, is a safe, clean, friendly place to board your pup(s) for the day. We love to hike, but our Bear isn't allowed on the trails, but she was loved and cared for at Boomers! Highly recommend.","September 13, 2019",Beautiful Theodore Roosevelt National Park,1,Missouri,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Not as dramatic as it‚Äôs neighbor, Badlands National Park, this park offers views of wilderness, geologic land features, and wildlife. See Buffalo up close from your car. See prairie dogs frolicking in their natural environment. Just a wonderful place for all ages.","September 12, 2019",Another beautiful park!,73,"Marietta, Georgia",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I love America's National Parks. I came here in early April so it was still pretty cold, but well worth the visit. I spent time at both the South and North portions of the park. The South Park had tons of Bison and many short (less than 1 mi) trails to hike. The North Park had dramatic views of the river. Both are open 24/7 and well worth a stop if you're in the area.","September 10, 2019",Off the Radar Great National Park,6,"Denver, Colorado",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Really impressed by the badlands, especially on the northern section of the park with the unique cannonball formations. Saw bissons, wild horses (only the south section),turkeys, big horn shoes from the road.","September 9, 2019",Well worth a visit,10,Ottawa,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We had decided to only view the south unit due to time. By chance we ended up near the North Unit and decided to drive through. I'm so glad we did. Both units have incredible views,and abundant wild life. Be ready for a few geology lessons as you drive.","September 9, 2019","Great Wilderness Park, Great Vistas",33,"Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We drove through both the North and South parks. The landscapes are unbelievable, but the parks are different: south is more green. We saw bison, horses, antelope, turkey, hawks, and prairie dogs.","September 8, 2019",Amazing!!,72,"Abbeville, South Carolina",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a really incredible park! The South and North sections are different and separate, but you should visit both. The South is a drivable loop with a variety of wildlife to see (buffalo, prairie dogs, turkey, deer), and the North offers stunning views and hiking trails. We spent a lot more time here than we were anticipating and can't wait to come back! ","September 7, 2019",Amazing park!,6,"Monroe, Wisconsin",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt Park is close to I 94 in western North Dakota. As with many parks there is a driving loop which allows for a short visit, but numerous hiking trails and a North loop if you are able to stay longer. The entrance to the park is in the town of medora which provides places to stay and eat. The park has bison and wild horses which we saw in several locations. Prairie dogs are in several locations and try not to run them over. The rock formations, and the winding Little Missouri river provide excellent viewing of beautiful natural formations.","September 6, 2019",This is beautiful park which is less visited,27,"St. Paul, United States",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Have seen turkeys, bighorn sheep, buffalo, wild horses, prairie dogs, and many different birds. Have heard elk but haven't seen them. Some visits haven't seen much and some visits have seen an abundance of animals. My toddler loves visiting the prairie dog towns. Visitor center/gift shop is nice. A couple restrooms and trash cans available along the drive. Trails for everyone from accessible to experienced.","September 5, 2019",Animals,89,"New England, North Dakota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"While this park cannot compete with the grandeur of parks like The Grand Canyon, it‚Äôs beauty lies in it‚Äôs ruggedness, open plains, and badlands terrain features. This park is accented with small herds of American bison, pronghorns, wild horses, and amazingly large, black-tailed prairie dog towns, which are fun to watch as they flitter about. This park is also co-located with the township of Medora, which also offers a great deal of things to do... museums, hot air balloon fest, pitchfork steak fondue, a musical with fireworks, etc. well worth the trip. Love this place.","September 5, 2019",Another Beautiful National Park,57,"Box Elder, South Dakota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"For those who enjoy winding roads, marvelous scenic stops, & less crowds than at more well-known National Parks, you'll enjoy Theodore Roosevelt National Park. With a sharp eye and a little luck, you'll see wild horses, bison, mountain goats and bighorn sheep. Be sure to pull over safely when you spot others stopped to see what they are gawking and photographing! Definitely get out of your vehicle and stretch your legs walking on a variety of short trails for a glimpse beyond the views afforded from the road. The Badlands here are very different from the Badlands in South Dakota. Be sure to include BOTH in your adventures. You won't be sorry! Tip: Take snacks, drinks, and a picnic lunch. There are no restaurants or gas stations within the park.","September 4, 2019",Stunning Views!,13,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"There are two units: North and South. We drove through the South Unit only and could not drive the entire loop as one of the roads was closed. The scenery was nice, but nothing breathtaking. The thousands of prairie dogs were a big hit as they are fun to watch. Visitor center, gift shop typically priced ( a vinyl sticker is 4 bucks) and Teddy Roosevelt's first cabin is very interesting to see.","September 4, 2019",We only saw the South Unit,217,"Chandler, Arizona",3

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt National Park it's one of our favorite places to go. We love the north unit the best. The camping has potable water available but you must use your camper electricity and sewer. Although there are restrooms. It is a beautiful park for hiking and seeking out animals in their natural habitat. The campground hosts are good to warn when the largest of the animals are roaming nearby but sometimes ya just gotta be alert. Most of the animals are born in the park so the animals are used to us humans, but be cautious they are still wild animals.An early morning or late evening drive is a good viewing time. Some of the animals we have been privileged to see are wild turkeys, rattle snakes, wild horses, mule deer, prairie dogs, kestrel, golden eagles, bison, mountain sheep, bats, fox, badger, elk, white tail deer, coyotes, long horn steer. Hope I haven't missed some. The hiking trails are unique, one follows a crevice in the ground, one crosses flat land to a prairie dog town, several hikes stay on high ground with beautiful scenery all the way. Some call it the bad lands, but it doesn't look bad to me, it is gorgeous. The south unit has its unique hiking trails also. So hard to explain, ya just have to go and experience it all yourself. The south unit has the tiny town of Medora nearby. Don't overlook this amazing National Park. It is...well just amazing.","September 3, 2019",A Camping Must,4,,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Wow! Beautiful park with no a lot of people. A true gem. I had a backcountry permit for two days. My first morning was a beautiful sight of about 50 head of buffalo. Nice, quiet, not a lot of noise pollution. They had an astronomy night with volunteers who brought their telescopes. Everyone had the treat to see Juniper with its 4 moons and Saturn with its rings. Again, that was a treat. Awesome trip!!!","September 2, 2019",Backcountry Permit,41,"Glasgow, Montana",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Is a wonderful place to visit. Only draw back was the first place we stopped was gift shop at the overlook rest stop. Park employee who worked they was rude and not very nice. So went to see the lower section of the park and stopped at that gift shop. Was night and day difference staff was very helpful and friendly. The park itself was fantastic. Saw lots of wild life and the views were great.,"September 1, 2019",Anniversary Trip,4,Minneiska,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Surprisingly beautiful park. Very accessible for families - easy hiking paths. Fun wildlife. The north unit is less busy but was even more beautiful in our opinion - definitely worth the drive if you have time. Caprock Coulee trail was really beautiful and one of the longer hikes. Many other hikes are in the 1-2 mile range. ,"August 30, 2019",awesome,0,Minneapolis,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,I stayed at Theador Roosevelt cottonwood campgrd in the park during my stay. Nice campgrd with georgous scenery on the little Missouri River. The buffalo herd occasionally wander thru but don't bother anything. It's especially exciting if you weren't aware it can happen (like my first time) but that makes it so unique. They have a great wildlife loop where herds of buffalo or wild horse can be seen. You won't be disappointed if you go.,"August 30, 2019",Beautiful country,1,,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,We had three full days at Theodore Roosevelt NP. It is a beautiful park. We spent one day in the north unit which was loaded with bison -- they were everywhere! We did the scenic drive and took several short hikes. We spent a lot of time in the South Unit. Part of the scenic drive was closed which was not an issue; we just went back and forth. There were so many prairie dogs - adorable! We did get to see the feral horses and a coyote. Definitely stop at Painted Canyon and take all the hikes you can to get amazing views of the beautiful landscape. We also attended the ranger-led talk about Theodore Roosevelt which was very interesting. A wonderful national park and gem!,"August 28, 2019",Wonderful National Park,62,"Wantage, New Jersey",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We drove both the South and North Parks in the same day. The loop road in the South Park is closed between Mile Markers 7 and 11. It is believed that the road will not be open for another 1 to 2 years, and if you look at their pictures, you'd understand. So basically you can drive 24 miles, turn around and drive 24 miles back...that's ok, but it takes time if you want to go the entire distance. We did see a few bison, prairie dogs and a few deer. It took about an hour to drive to the North Park entrance. That drive is 14 miles out and 14 miles back the same way. We did see a rather large herd of bison, right up close to the road; babies too! Both parks are in Badlands and beautiful in their own special way.","August 26, 2019",Good Park,28,"Maple Grove, Minnesota",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We had a good time visiting the North unit of the park. The scenery is dramatic. It was interesting seeing TR's cabrin and learning about his time there. We drove the scenic loop (minus the part that is closed because the road is out). We stopped several times and took some short hikes. We didn't see a lot of wildlife. We saw prairie dogs, a herd of bison, 4 solo bison, and a few hawks. If you want to see a lot of wildlife, I recommend you go to Yellowstone. No other park has come anywhere close to all of the animals that we saw there.","August 26, 2019",Dramatic scenery ,75,"Sunnyvale, California",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This park has beautiful scenery and nice hiking trails. There is a good loop road around the southern unit, but the last portion of the loop is closed so that visitors have to retrace their path back to the entrance. There are lots of parking areas along the loop and many have hiking trails. We saw lots of bison in several herds. We met one herd of about 100 bison on the road. We stopped the car and the critters just sort of flowed around us. It was very impressive. We also saw some wild horses and lots of prairie dogs. The prairie dogs here were the tamest I have ever encountered. They weren't bothered at all by tourists. There are several prairie dog villages.","August 26, 2019",Very good park with lots of wildlife.,76,"Amite, Louisiana",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This park is a good visit, especially for Teddy Roosevelt history and his conservation efforts. The film at the visitor's center is worthwhile, and there is where you will see the actual cabin that T.R. lived in (very humble). The best Bison (Buffalo) sightings we have ever had were in this park at the Peaceful Valley Ranch site. Many cars, we noticed, breezed past this location, consequently missing this spectacle of so many up close and personal Bison sightings. The scenery was good, and we did not take advantage of the available trails.","August 25, 2019",Best Place To See Bison Up Close,15,"Fort Myers, Florida",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Visited late in the afternoon around 4pm until late evening in early August. There weren't that many wildlife during the afternoon aside from the prairie dogs and rattlesnakes on the road, but plenty of wildlife as soon as the sunsets. Be careful when driving at night as there were plenty of feral horses, porcupines, jackrabbits, and rattlesnakes on the road. Hard to see when there's no light out (aside from your high beams) and bug residue on your windshield.For night photography, the parking at Coal Vein Trail was perfect for it as there was very little light pollution.For sunset photography, Wind Canyon Trail has great scenery for this.A section of the scenic drive was closed off when I was there, so you'll need to loop back when you get to the end of the trail.Best time to view Bison is early in the morning just before 7:30am as that's when they start to migrate across the prairie dog plains.Please drive slowly as there were a number of prairie dogs that were run over on the road (not by me).","August 25, 2019",Coal Vein Trail for Night photography,61,"Toronto, Canada",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Visited here on a Friday in August with friends. The park was not crowded at all. We had great weather which really made the visit that much more enjoyable. We went around the south end and got to see so many stunning vistas. I was just in awe of how beautiful and wild the badlands are. We visited the visitors center and TR‚Äôs cabin behind it. Well worth the $30 for our car to get in the park. Highly recommend! ,"August 23, 2019",Lovely national park,27,"Huntsville, Alabama",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent 2 days in TRNP and our favourite was the North Unit, about 1 hour north of Medora and the South Unit. Whilst in the North Unit, we hiked the stunning Caprock Coullee Trail, which provided a wonderful views and a real experience of the landscape of the park. It is a 4.2 mile round trip and we did it as a family (me, wife and 2 tweenager girls) and is a MUST DO hike if in the region. We saw the bison herds in both South and North units, happily getting stuck in traffic jams. Our girls did the Junior Ranger program in the South Unit. We saw the wild horses in the South Unit and multitudes of prairie dogs in the many towns. We also hiked the Painted Nature Trail one afternoon, a smaller hike that gets you down amongst this colourful canyon.","August 22, 2019",Loved the North Unit,327,"Doylestown, Pennsylvania",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Museum inside the visitor's center had a lot of interesting displays. When I visited, part of the loop road was closed due to a road collapse. This made some parts of the park inaccessible and traffic heavier than usual. Lots of places to stop and take photos. The prairie dog town was my favorite. I would have liked more pull-off areas, as I felt like I was missing out being the driver in my vehicle. I toured the cabin at the visitor's center and the ranger leading the tour was knowledgeable and interesting.","August 20, 2019",Hidden gem,1,"Clarksville, Tennessee",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The park is thirty dollars ($30.00) to enter and it is well worth it. Currently, one can use twenty-four (24) of the thirty-six (36) miles of the park loop in the southern part; there is road construction on the the last twelve (12) miles. There are many vistas to pull over and to enjoy the amazing panoramas of the badlands. I did some great hikes, as well. I wish I saw more than only a buffalo, but I was happy to get a picture of it. I also saw many prarie dogs. Interstate 94 is right by the park.","August 20, 2019","I am visiting my last few states of the fifty (50) states, and I am happy that I chose this location for North Dakota.",80,"New York City, New York",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We pleasantly surprised by touring this National Park. The scenery was beautiful and we encounter herds of buffalo in both the North and South units. We had to wait some time to get past one herd, as they took over a roadway at the North unit.","August 19, 2019",Buffalo Oh My!!,1,"Cumberland, Rhode Island",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We had a weekend available and decided to head to North Dakota. We are big national park visitors so while this park isn't as dramatic as the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, we are so happy it has been preserved for everyone to enjoy. This park is great if you like to feel as if you have the area all to yourself! Even when we ran into a long line entering the park on Saturday morning, once inside the park (and past the massive bison viewing) everyone spreads out and you won't see many other visitors. Be aware that there is only bathrooms at the visitors center and campgrounds. The south unit had an additional toilet between Buck Hill and Coal Vein. Be sure to take food, water and sunscreen with you. We spent about five hours at the North Unit. This included the 28 mile round trip drive, visitor's center and short hikes. You could probably do it in half the time. It is about 1 hour and 15 minutes from the South Unit entrance to the North Unit entrance. We stayed about 8 hours total in the South Unit but you could probably do it in about 3 hours depending on stops. If you can only make it to the Wind Canyon Trail, it's worth spending the time. We stayed in Dickinson as ours was a last minute trip but if you could stay in Medora it would save time. Staying in Dickinson added 1/2 hour to South Unit and it was 1 hour and 15 minutes to the North Unit.","August 19, 2019",Stop and Enjoy!,153,"Johnston, Iowa",4

We wanted to stop by for an hour here but ended up spending half a day and that was just not enough. The park has 2 areas - north and south - and we only got to do a quick drive on the south loop and it was incredible leaving us to want to spend more time here but we could not. Wildlife is near, views are scenic - well worth a day or two to spend here. wish I had researched this more and planned more time.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited TR last year and camped at Juniper, in the Northern Unit. I would like to tell you the park is a horrible place and to stay away, and therefore keep it to myself, but I cant lie. We adore Northern Unit; it has less of the drive-by nature tourists and more hikers and campers. There are so many hikes you can take and the views on the Caprock Coulee Trail are spectacular. Be sure and always sign the trail register. Government runs on statistics. If you want to see wildlife the best time is at sunrise.We hiked the Petrified Forest in Southern Unit. The bentonitic soil is like ice if its wet so avoid that; the Visitor Center keeps track of humidity and can advise. We saw several herds of wild horses this trip, and the Longhorn cattle, in addition to bison, whitetail deer, mule deer and Bighorn Sheep. It is easy to imagine the park in Teddy's day when you are exploring. This park is such a gem, I hesitate to say too much....","August 16, 2019",Cant wait to return!!,13,"Black Creek, Wisconsin",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"TR Park is divided into three sections and we were only able to explore the southern part of the park. Accessed via the town of Medora, there is a visitor center as soon as you enter the park. Oddly there were lines in both the male and female restrooms both times that we were there. There is a large loop road that takes you through the park and provides an opportunity to view prairie dogs, bison, wild horses, deer, etc. We were not able to drive the entire road as road construction was going on. However, the parts of the park that we were able to see offered stunning vistas. Anyone in North Dakota should make an effort to go and visit.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The Theodore Roosevelt National Park is a huge park spread over three separate sites in two time zones. The more popular South Unit has its entrance at Medora, ND, which itself is a charming Western town with several restaurants and lodgings. The South Unit Visitor's Center is like a mini-museum devoted to the namesake President. There is a wonderful exhibit of Teddy Roosevelt's personal hunting and adventure items, plus a marvelous wooden sculpture of him on horseback.The 36-mile Scenic Loop Drive is a great way to experience the highlights of the South Unit. Unfortunately, a large section of the drive was closed for repairs in July 2019. This reduced the scenic drive to about 15 miles each way. There are still plenty of scenic view points and hikes along the way, and plentiful prairie dogs to see. I did not see any large wildlife, such as, bison, elk, badgers, bighorn sheep, or bears.If you just want a quick and free visit to the Park, there is the Painted Canyon immediately adjacent to I94, 6 miles east of Medora and the South Unit Entrance. This overlook offers excellent views of the colorful hues of the topography in what is actually the Badlands of North Dakota. I visited the Badlands National Park in South Dakota on the previous day so as to make a good comparison of the two somewhat related parks, at least geologically and topographically. The Theodore Roosevelt National Park will remain, in the end, a unique and expansive space, different from the one in South Dakota, and dedicated to the person who spearheaded the National Park system and who sought to the preserve these unique American spaces.","August 13, 2019",North Dakota Badlands Dedicated to the President Who Made the National Park System Possible,44,"Goleta, California",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This national park is so isolated that very few people visit the park annually. That makes it so pleasant, open and uncluttered. In fact, there are no concessions and only 1 bathroom in the entire park! We were able to see bison, wild long horn cattle, deer, mountain sheep to name a few. It is small compared to Yellowstone but very nice for getting away from crowds. The landscape is beautiful including the badlands area. You can easily see the park South section in a day and then travel to the north section the following day. However, in Medora, just outside the entrance to the park on the South side there is plenty to see so staying in the area for a couple of nights would be best to take it all in. While in the park you can imagine the early days of settlers, their way of life and the beauty of the land they settled in.","August 11, 2019",A gem of a national park,14,"Nashville, Tennessee",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Loved this park. We were on our way home from Glacier National Park and stopped here for an overnight. We visited the South Dakota Badlands two years ago so it was great to see how different the northern Badlands are. The rangers at the South Unit Visitor Center were super helpful and let us know about the top trails and sites to see in our short amount of time. Due to our limited time we were only able to visit the South Unit, which was super disappointing but we will save something for next time! We camped at the Cottonwood Campground and were able to listen to coyotes throughout the night. The campground was full so reservations are helpful! We drove the Scenic Loop Drive for as far as we could (a small part of the road is closed due to a wash out). Along the way we saw lots of wildlife (so many adorable prairie dogs) and hiked many of the shorter trails. Would definitely recommend hiking through the prairie dog town to the Old East Entrance Station. On the way out the next day we stopped at the Painted Canyon Visitor Center and hiked the nature trail. This seemed to also be a rest area so if you don't have a lot of time this is a great stop to at least take in the views and get a very small idea of what this park has to offer.","August 11, 2019",Beautiful Park!,60,"Des Moines, Iowa",5

Both the north and south units are well worth the drive. Each has a visitor center with knowledgeable rangers and lots of info about hikes. Each unit has a drive with lots of places to stop and hike, both short trails and longer. There are also tons of viewpoints and scenic vistas.

North unit not very busy. South unit is accessed right in Medora and is much busier than the north unit. The loop road was no longer a loop but an out and back.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Until we started planning a trip to the Dakotas, I will admit that I had never heard of the TR National Park. It was well worth the stop at the South Unit right off I-94. There is a loop route that you can drive, with all sorts of trails - short and long - which are well worth it. The two best viewpoints were at Buck Hill, where you park and climb up on a very tall mound, and then off I-94 at the Painted Canyon Visitor center, where you get a feel for how big this badlands area is. We stayed in Dickinson, and it was an easy 30 minute drive to the park. There were all kinds of bison, wild horses, prairie dogs, and other animals.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My family and I visited Theodore Roosevelt National Park as part of a 14-day, 3,200 mile adventure. We spent one night at the Cottonwood Campground in Site #55 which was situated along the banks of the Little Missouri River. Not all sites have such proximity to the river. I actually called the park months before to ask for a recommendation on a good campsite and I was very pleased with our site. Odd numbered sites can be reserved in advance, even number sites are available on a first come, first served basis. The campground was maybe 2/3 full, bathrooms were nearby and clean (flush toilets, sinks, no showers). Pro Tip: for a little extra privacy, check out the picnic area bathrooms located inside of the Cottonwood Campground as you first turn in... they were clean and completely unoccupied. There are no fire rings on campsites but a grill is provided for cooking. Not feeling like cooking? It‚Äôs okay, the town of Medora has a few dining options but just be aware that many stores and shops close at 7pm. That goes for ice cream shops too, my kids were bummed!The park itself reminded me of a cross between Badlands and Wind Cave National Parks. During our visit, a section of the loop road was closed but there was still plenty to explore. We saw wild horses, bison and prairie dogs. I‚Äôm told big horn sheep, coyotes and many other species can regularly be seen. The Maltese Cabin in the rear of the visitor center (in Medora) is worth checking out and I‚Äôd recommend attending the brief ranger-led presentation detailing Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs cabin and personal belongings/replicas contained inside. While on the topic of ranger programs, the evening program in the Cottonwood Camprgound Amphitheater was fantastic. The program discussed the native Indian tribes and homesteaders and compared both cultures. This trip was eye-opening to the injustices against the Native American people.The badlands of this park are beautiful and complimented by ever-changing skies. Storms can roll in quickly or blow over just the same. The night sky was awesome for star gazing, with shooting stars and dark night skies that make viewing a treat.Happy to answer any questions, feel free to drop me a note or share your experiences.","August 5, 2019",Theodore Roosevelt National Park,2,"Baltimore, Maryland",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The park is easily accessible from Medora but once inside you are mostly limited to follow the road and observe the wildlife from your car. Only a few car parks on the loop road. This sometimes leads to roadblocks when a dozen cars or more stop on the roadside to take photos. Some motorists don‚Äôt even bother pulling over - they just stop their cars. There is a circuit road which allows visitors to do a complete loop, but when we were there the road was closed in one section so we had to double back and retrace our route. The signs say don‚Äôt pull over onto the shoulder of the road but most people do it anyway. Maybe the Parks Service could provide more areas for cars to pull over and not damage the natural vegetation? A balance needs to be struck and if people are going to do it anyway maybe this would minimize futuredamage?Limited wildlife compared with other parks eg. Grand Teton, Yellowstone. Smaller herds of bison but plenty of prairie dog towns. My overall impression is of a lot of traffic in a relatively small area and less wildlife than other parks.Worth a look but you wouldn‚Äôt go back, unlike other parks which are more spectacular interns of scenery and more densely populated by wildlife.","July 22, 2019","A unique, beautiful park but with limited access",5,"Thirroul, Australia",3

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I visited Theodore Roosevelt National Park with my family for the first time last week and couldn't believe how beautiful and peaceful it was. In my opinion, this is one of the most unspoiled National Parks in the country. Perhaps due to it's remote location, the park isn't nearly as crowded as most National Parks that I've been to. Since I only had time to visit the South Unit and Painted Canyon, I can only speak for those 2 sections. The South Unit Loop road is wonderful. There are dozens of scenic viewpoints with trails. Although the road is partially closed right now, you don't miss much. You just have to turn around and go back the way you came. Unfortunately, although we did see some wildlife during our visit, we didn't see any buffalo. We talked to a few ""regular"" visitors who said they usually see buffalo when they visit but hadn't this time for whatever reason.The Visitor Center has an informative video to watch, and you can also visit Theodore Roosevelt's Maltese Cross Cabin directly behind the Visitor Center.The cabin may not look all that impressive, but it's a real piece of our nation's history!The Painted Canyon is worth a quick stop.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent a full day seeing the South Unit, Painted Canyon visitor center and overlook, and the North Unit. We enjoyed the film at the visitor center very much, giving background on Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs passion for this land and for US conservation. At the S. Unit Visitor Center, we did a quick tour through the museum; this was very interesting with a number of Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs personal items on display. We were happy to catch a park ranger giving an informative tour on Roosevelt and his Maltese Cross cabin, located right outside the South unit visitor center. We took the scenic drive at the South unit; right now, you cannot do the scenic drive in a loop, because part of the road is closed due to a road failure. So we had to drive about 26 miles in, and then turn around and do the same drive to go out. We stopped at all the overlooks and hiked all the South unit short trails. We then went to the Painted Canyon Visitor Center and Overlook, and took some photos. From there we drove about 60 miles north to get to the north unit. I liked the scenery better there; it reminded me more of the Badlands that we visited last year in South Dakota. The north unit has nicer scenery, but the road condition is not quite as good, the visitor center is a trailer versus a building, and there aren‚Äôt as many turnouts; it‚Äôs also a shorter scenic drive (you drive 14 miles one way, then turn around and go back the same way, so it‚Äôs 28 miles round-trip.) We did not see much wildlife: we saw a small group of bison along the road of the south unit and one bison way down hill at the North unit‚Äôs Oxbow Bend. Overall, if you are in the area, it is definitely worth seeing Theodore Roosevelt national Park. We did not rate it five (excellent) because it‚Äôs enjoyable, but not as amazing as the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, for example.","July 7, 2019","We are thankful for Roosevelt, the conservationist!",164,"Lambertville, New Jersey",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My husband and I drove through this south park. There are signs all over on i94 and it's really not difficult to find at all. It's a slow winding road. Due to the road washing out, you cannot drive the full loop, so they turn you around about half way. We saw a lot of prairie dogs, wild horses and bison. The animals get right next to the road (especially the little prairie dogs), so be very careful driving. Besides the wildlife, the scenery is gorgeous. They have several places to hike and camp if you're into that. This park wasn't even on our list of places to go when we first started planning our trip, but I'm very happy that we went.","July 6, 2019",Stunning,110,"Columbia, Maryland",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This may not be the largest or the most majestic of our national parks, but it defwarrants spending time in it. Be aware that the only place to picnic is at the campground area. That said, the tables are set up in a lovely wooded area. You can hike as much or as little as you are inclined to do. There is plenty of wildlife to enjoy.. My only complaint is with the visitor center. I found a lovely scarf with the image of the park on it. However, it was made in China! Really?

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We scheduled a visit to the Theodore Roosevelt National Park as a tag along stop after Yellowstone since we traveled I94 back to Michigan. We were delighted to visit this beautiful park. An underrated gem. I highly recommend seeing both the south and north units. The colors and rock formations at the north unit are stunning. We had been to the Badlands in South Dakota and in comparison the Badlands in North Dakota seemed a bit more of a mixture of Badlands and Prairie woven together. There are campgrounds at both north and south units we drove through. I thought the campground at the south unit adjacent to the Little Missouri River lovely. Would love to camp there. The park is best viewed after a visit to the visitors center. Wildlife is there to enjoy...bison, wild horses, prairie dogs, mule deer, longhorn cattle. The north unit features an outstanding view of the Little Missouri River. North Dakota in general was well worth the visit. The state is beautiful and I think often underrated or overlooked.

Much less crowded that the southern part its a beautiful scenic drive with beautiful overlooks. Though not so much animals.The more visited South Unit (easier reachable) is compared to the northern part much less spectacular regarding the landscape but has much more animals. Came across a herd of wild horses with goals and saw several times buffalos- once a herd of at least 80 I counted.And was crowded in by some on the street as they were happily munching aloung the roadside.

The prairie dogs didn't like our presence and made sure to let us know with their barking. Still it was fun to watch the young ones playing and running about. Not many pull offs and very little shade, so bring a hat and plenty of sun screen. Also be sure to carry lots of water. There are only a couple of spots to picnic being few tables or benches.

We saw buffalo including a large herd and also individuals scattered around We saw a large pack of wild horses a cayote and several pronghorns. These sightings were all during the day when not many animals are supposed to be out. We took a 3 mile hike in the western part of the park to see petrified wood. It was a nice hike if a little steep at times and there were no other people around. We did see a rabbit and a wild horse as well as exploring lots of petrified wood.

The trails are shorter, less than a mile, and fairly easy to walk along.Part way into the park we encountered a herd of bison running along the road on the other side of the fence, then had to stop for bison further down who were on the road. We also encountered wild horses and even a cow on the road.

(There were no trail guide at the start of the trail, but was able to get one at the visitors center.) The views at the Painted Canyon Visitor Center were well worth the stop.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This ""badland"" landscape in western North Dakota along the Little Missouri River is resplendent with intricately eroded canyons and carved buttes that are striped with colorful layers of sediment. We liked this park even better than Badlands National Park because it has more vegetation, giving it a richer palette and more variation in the scenery. We visited in early June and it was an incredibly beautiful time of year, with bright green grass sprouting and many wildflowers blooming. We saw bison with newborn calves, wild horses and multitudes of prairie dogs.Theodore Roosevelt National Park contains 3 separate areas along the Little Missouri River: South Unit, North Unit, and Elkhorn Ranch. The South Unit is the most accessible and most-visited because Interstate 94 passes along its southern boundary. The entrance, visitor center (daily, 8:00-4:30 Mountain Time with extended hours in summer), and Roosevelt's restored cabin are located at the town of Medora at exit 27. A 36-mile paved scenic loop drive serves this south section of the park, providing access to numerous viewpoints and trail heads, as well as a picnic area and campground. The town of Medora offers some tourist attractions of its own and provides services like food, lodging, and gasoline. During the summer months, a second visitor center is open in the South Unit at Painted Canyon Overlook, which is in the southeast corner of the unit at exit 32 on the Interstate. This site offers a panoramic view of the valley below, a picnic area, and a nature trail. The entrance to the North Unit of the park is located 48 miles north of Interstate 94 on US Highway 85 (driving distance between the North and South Units is 68 miles). This unit features a 28-mile (one-way) paved scenic drive with several viewpoints that culminates with breath-taking views of the Little Missouri River at the Oxbow Overlook. A visitor center with information, exhibits, and restrooms is available near the entrance (open 9:00-5:00 Central Time Friday through Monday, daily in summer). A picnic area and campground are located about 2.5 miles west of the visitor center on the scenic drive. The closest food and lodging to the North Unit are at Watford City about 10-15 miles north. Gasoline is available at Watford City or Grassy Butte, about 20 miles south of the North Unit Entrance. The third unit of the park is the former site of Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch. Only the foundation remains, with educational panels to recount the history (no services). It's located in a remote area between the North and South Units (about 30 miles north of I-94) and is accessed via a steep, unpaved road that is prone to wash-outs. Check with park staff about road conditions before attempting to visit it.We were able to visit both the North and South Units in one day. It's a lot of driving but possible if you aren't planning to do much else. We were traveling with a wheelchair, which limited the activities available to us. Because of the difference in time zones, we started with the scenic drive to Oxbow Overlook at the North Unit, then returned south to Painted Canyon Overlook before taking the scenic drive at the South Unit. The most wheelchair-accessible areas for us were the visitor centers, picnic areas, Oxbow Overlook, and Painted Canyon. Many of the overlooks had accessible parking and a short sidewalk so you could at least get out of the car if desired. If you only have time to visit one unit, we preferred the North Unit because it's more remote, less developed, and there were fewer people.If you don't have a NPS pass, the entrance fee for Theodore Roosevelt is $30/vehicle, $25/motorcycle or $15/hiker, biker or horse. The admission is valid at all 3 units for 7 days. (I'm not sure, but Painted Canyon may not charge admission.) The North and South Units are open year-round, but sections can be closed intermittently due to dangerous weather or road damage/repairs. It's always a good idea to check the park website before visiting. Keep in mind that the North and South Units are in different time zones; the time at the South Unit is an hour earlier than the North Unit.A note about pets: be aware that dogs are allowed in the park but must be leashed or contained and kept to developed areas like sidewalks, campgrounds, parking lots, and picnic areas. They are not permitted on hiking trails.","March 26, 2019",Marvelous Wilderness and Wildlife,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt National Park is one of the lesser known and visited national parks but this is certainly due to its way out of the way location and not due to any lack of interesting features, wildlife or scenic beauty. Composed of three distinct units, the South Unit, North Unit and the Elkhorn Ranch, each have their own character. The Elkhorn Ranch unit preserves one of two ranches in the area that Teddy Roosevelt owned interest in but can only be reached by a long drive on unpaved roads.The South Unit, located just north of I-94 near the small, historic city of Medora, is by far the most visited of the park‚Äôs units and is a great blend of history and nature. The excellent visitor center has a good park film, lots of information, much of it oriented around TR, and, behind the visitor center, is TR‚Äôs relocated and restored ranch home, the Maltese Cross Cabin, which is available for tours. The South Unit also has an excellent 36 mile (58k) scenic drive where one will certainly see lots of wildlife including many bison, prairie dog towns and wild horses. Along the scenic drive are numerous pullouts, offering beautiful views of the North Dakota Badlands and trailheads for one of many trails of varying length and difficulty.The North Unit, located on US-85 about 68 miles (110k) from the South Unit, is much less visited and one will find the overlooks and trails much more peaceful with few other people around. Along the North Unit‚Äôs 14 mile (22.5k) scenic drive one will find even more spectacular views that include the Little Missouri River and huge swaths of Badlands, interesting geology at the Cannonball Concretions pullout, and fewer, but in general, better trails. While the density of wildlife is not as great as in the South Unit, you will certainly see bison, excellent prairie dog towns, and a heard of free range longhorn steers that the Park Service maintains to commemorate the ranching heritage dating back to Roosevelt‚Äôs time.","January 20, 2019",A Lesser Known Treasure,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

They handled it well.","November 15, 2018",Most beautiful spot in North Dakota,13,,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"On a trip through the west my wife and I decided to tour TRNP. We are sure glad we did. The north and south units are completely different but both worth the visit. Each can be viewed with an easy day for each. The north unit has more grassland with the Little Missouri River meandering through the canyon. Plenty of opportunities to see wildlife, bison, deer, and turkeys for our visit. Make sure to stop and view the ""cannonball"" concretions. The south unit is similar to the South Dakota badlands but has more plains type of areas. We did see bison, deer, and wild horses in this unit. Of note, there are no place to eat in either unit so it would be a good idea to pack in a lunch, drinks, and snacks. Well worth the visit!","November 7, 2018","Give this national park a chance, you won't regret it.",9,,5

Unlike many others, he saw opportunities to graze cattle and bought acres for ranching. ‚ÄúTeddy‚Äù was the president who started our national parks and gave ranch land so everyone could come and enjoy the land he loved.Native to the park are buffalo, elk, mountain goats, wild horses, prairie dogs, mule deer, plus many other animals and birds. The park has great trails for hiking and horse riding. Dogs are only allowed on paved roads & trail areas because buffaloes hate dogs. We enjoyed the park and surrounding area.

Some acted as lookouts, chirping away, while others scurried around. They were very close to the shoulder of the road, at times. We saw bison along the shoulder of the road, too. The views from the overlooks were great, especially the one overlooking the Badlands.

There are hiking and horse trails besides the roads that meander through the park, and also campgrounds and picnic areas all around the area.

There isn‚Äôt much between the two, so plan to do the drive in one setting. The park itself was gorgeous, well worth the drive. Plan to spend about half a day doing the drive around the park. The visitor centers are both pretty small. The one in Medora has a nice exhibit on Theodore Roosevelt that‚Äôs worth a few minutes to check out. The drive around the park takes you through a couple prairie dog towns and short walks. We saw a lot of wildlife including prairie dogs, prong horns, and bison.

The SOUTH entrance to the park is located in the small town of Medora and if at all possible I would recommend staying here. We arrived on a Saturday early afternoon and after stopping by the Visitor Center and Roosevelt's cabin, we traveled part of the 35+ mile drive through this part of the park. There were areas of unpaved roadway due to the current construction project, but work was apparently finished for the weekend so we had no delays along the route. We returned on Sunday with a picnic lunch and spent the day exploring.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The park is great. We saw a lot of animals including about 10 wild horses total but they were all at a long distance. Saw one pair off alone that looked to be a black stallion with a speckled paint mare. The only reason we thought that was because she looked like she was ready to pop she was so big in the belly. We also saw 2 male prong horn sheep sparring. They were a few hundred feet away but thankfully the wind was right and we could hear their horns clicking and them snorting a bit. It was like watching a nature show on PBS but really far off. A pair of binoculars really enhances the experience. Lost count of the number of bison and prairie dogs we saw. If we hadn‚Äôt seen one animal it still would have been worth a visit because of the views in the park. The painted rock walls are something to behold.The only bad experience we had was with the road construction crew. They have a system that includes a ‚Äúpilot car‚Äù that is supposed to set the pace through the construction zone. Trouble is, the person that was driving it was going over 20 miles an hour above the posted speed limit making it hard to keep up and impossible to take in any views while they were hauling a** down the road. I had just paid $80 at the gate and we couldn‚Äôt see anything while they were driving that pace. Then we got yelled at by some road crew flunky because we stopped following the idiot that was driving reckless in the ‚Äúpilot car‚Äù. To add insult to injury, the road crew flunky decided to take a picture of our license plate when we were exiting the park.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Teddy Roosevelt credited his time in western North Dakota in the 1880s for rejuvenating him after the death of his wife and mother, preparing him for the presidency and developing a deep sense of appreciation for nature and wild landscapes of the country. Teddy went on to become the greatest ""conservation"" president in the history of the U.S., designating millions of acres of national parks and national forests. The park that bears his name is a pleasant surprise. Unknown to most Americans, this lesser visited park is nonetheless quite spectacular, with stark landscapes and lots of wildlife. The Southern Unit is the more visited (due to its proximity to population centers and major highways). But the North Unit is not to be missed either, if possible. Both units have wonderful drives: the North Unit a 14-mile road with several fabulous overlooks; the South Unit with a 37-mile loop drive. Lots of wildlife in both: bison, mule deer, elk, wild horses, prairie dogs, and more. Very nice visitor center at the Medora South Unit entrance; enjoy the 17-minute introductory movie.","October 10, 2018","Thanks, Teddy!",1176,"Bangkok, Thailand",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The scenery in this park is simply stunning. The park has three units - north, south and the Elkhorn Ranch - and is important to the study of Theodore Roosevelt. Here you learn how his stay in the area molded him for the presidency and led to his legacy in conservation. The south unit features the Painted Canyon visitors center and overlook as well as a driving loop - scenic views, trails and wildlife abound. Stop at the prairie dog towns - it's entertaining to watch these critters go about their daily lives. The south unit also features the Maltese Cross Cabin (where TR originally stayed) and a visitors center (on the edge of the town of Medora) which highlights the story of TR in North Dakota. You experience a dramatic scenery change on the drive to the north unit - from prairie/grasslands to canyons. Magnificent! The road from the unit entrance leads to the Oxbow overlook of the Little Missouri River. There is a hiking trail leading from the overlook through the grasslands to another a high spot above the river. Spectacular scenery! But be careful where you step - remember, buffalo do live here. The Elkhorn Ranch is a bit more off the beaten path as far as road quality but there were good wildlife sightings long the way - a lot of pronghorns and deer on my visit. There is not a lot to see at the interpretive site itself (you walk a trail to reach the actual ranch site) - no buldings left but you gain a sense of why TR chose this as a living spot. He liked to sit on the veranda of this cabin - and the gentle breezes at the site show why. (If you are going to this site, check with a visitor center/ranger for directions, etc). Lots of opportunities for camping and picnics and hikes throughout the park. Comparatively speaking, not a lot of visitors travel to the park (or North Dakota itself, for that matter). However, the park is a national treasure - with striking scenery, history and wildlife viewing - what's not to like.","October 10, 2018","Calling all Theodore Roosevelt, National Parks and Wildlife Viewing Fans",29,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

The uniqueness is that it has very little plantation, especially hard to see woods or big trees. In addition, it has lots of rocks or rock hills that has a variety of shapes and specific structures - I believe, this is how the beauty of the park is embodied. Because of little plantation, wild animals such as deers are also not so many in the park as in other places or national parks.

Unfortunately it was a cold and rainy day for late August and our hiking was limited. The park's views are timeless and serene. We hiked the Painted Canyon and Upper Talkington trails and viewed the cliffs and badland formations from Skyline Vista, Boicourt Overlook and Buck Hill among other spots. We saw plenty of wildlife including buffalo, prairie dogs, a herd of about 10 wild horses, pronghorn and loads of mule deer. The park was not crowded at all due to bad weather and its out of the way location.One other highlight of the visit was seeing the Maltese Cross Ranch Cabin where TR spent an entire year in mourning for his late wife and mother who passed away on the same day in 1884. He wanted to be alone in his grief. The cabin was moved from its original location to the rear of the visitor center in Medora. Those of us who love our national parks owe it all to TR whose idea it was to establish the national parks.We stayed in Dickinson, ND which was about 25 miles east of Medora, but a fast drive away on I-94.

This is definitely one of our favorite national parks for the sheer scope of its beauty and abundant wildlife.","September 13, 2018",Remote and Majestic,631,"Naples, Florida",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We stopped here on our way to Glacier National Park. We arrived here about 8:45 am on a Sunday morning. It felt like we had the park to ourselves! We drove through and made a few stops in the Southern Park first. We completed the loop which was about 36 miles. It was very beautiful and saw quite a few buffalo. We then headed to the Northern portion. Which is quite a drive, but a decent and kind of pretty one at that. I‚Äôve heard from others that this one has a lot less traffic. However, since we were there so early this one almost seemed like more traffic. This park is not a loop but a down and back road which I believe is about 14 miles each way. We did not enjoy this portion as much as the other but still beautiful. We would definitely go back!","September 11, 2018",A Pleasant Surprise ,5,"Monticello, Iowa",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Early September is a perfect time to visit. The land is still lush but evening light comes early and quite quickly. The south loop, despite its construction, was a treat to drive with plenty of short hikes getting exercise and fresh air. Sometimes too fresh as the bison leave their calling cards everywhere. The north had some road issues that seemed pretty new but they did not stop us. The bison seemed to love the fact that the park was quieter and took advantage of the lush grass by the road. We loved every moment and are glad we made the effort to go. ","September 10, 2018",This is a gem hidden in a state not know for a lot of tourist attractions,22,"Maplewood, Minnesota",5

We drove through the park and did several trails. Most were well marked. Twice we saw another ranger. One time he was answering questions about one of the trails. The other time he had spotted a herd of big horn sheep and was showing people where they were.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,My wife and I visited this park on our way to the Badlands. It was definitely worth seeing and distinct enough from its neighbor in South Dakota.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I had a debate in my head about whether to give this a four or five star rating. While not as marvelous, scenic or splendidly as the Badlands of South Dakota, Theodore Roosevelt National Park has beautiful scenery and good wildlife viewing opportunities, as does the South. There are several views of the Little Missouri River in the North Unit that are gorgeous, especially, at the end of the highway, where the Little Missouri takes a radical bend.There are prairie dog towns, bison, longhorns(North Unit) feral horses(South Unit) and a fantastic petrified forest in the South Unit, to say nothing of Theodore Roosevelt's Ranch. I have yet to see any, but there are also pronghorn and bighorn sheep.In all my visits to both units, I have seen at least three bison, and in my visits to the North unit, have seen sparring bison bulls, a bull trying to court a cow, and a herd running across a narrow ledge of the Badlands.I note that the sometimes rough condition of the roads is a complaint for many, but to me, that is part of the draw to the park. It is less developed than some and has less visitors than most National Parks.","August 17, 2018",Small but extremely Satisfying,1,,5

Don't get me wrong, TRNP is definitely worth a visit, and if it had been one of the first parks we had visited, I would have given it 5 stars. The badlands here are interesting in their own right, plus we saw a huge herd of bison, prairie dogs, and two herds of wild horses, not something you see every day. The loop road runs through very interesting scenery and the scenic overlooks are very well marked and maintained.Although we didn't stop, there is a place along the road where the rangers talk about all the fossils that are found in the park.

I am so happy we found it! This park is now at the top of our favorites list (with Denali, Arches, Badlands) This Park is extremely accessible for all ages. (As someone with a fear of heights some parks are best viewed between fingers from a backseat, this is not one of them) we drove through the South unit in several hours taking our time. Bison, prairie dogs, horses abound in this park. All are family favorites. We took several short hikes. The coal vein trail had an interesting interpretive brochure at trail head. The markers were like a scavenger hunt for the kids. This park is physically reminiscent of Badlands in South Dakota however peaks are gentler, landscape is a little greener, and softer. Our children joyfully completed the junior Ranger program. We loved the history and connection to Theodore Roosevelt. The visitors center in South Unit is small and packed with interesting information about flora, fauna and TR. the crowds are small in this park and it adds to the appeal and access. This park is divided into three units and the highway cuts right through part of the South unit. A few exits up from Medora you can visit Painted Canyon. This offers a beautiful vista.

We saw one buffalo and 4 wild horses - oh, and about 30000 prairie dogs. It was 96 degrees out so that might have accounted for lack of animal sightings.

It didn‚Äôt take me as long to go through the South Unit as I thought so i definitely had the time to do the North Unit in the adternoon. There was some rain during the afternoon but not enough to deter my visit. I returned to the park two days later. I went back to the South Unit closer to sunset.

The 33 mile loop is an easy, beautiful drive. We saw hundreds of prairie dogs, a number of wild horses, and large numbers of bison (at one point, the car was completely surrounded by about 75-85 of them), and (of course) a few idiots who for some reason decided they'd be safe getting out of their cars to take close-ups of the bison. The scenery is gorgeous, especially early morning or near sunset (which is when we were there). There is also an overlook area at the eastern end of the park, completely separate from the 33 mile drive through ""loop"" which is beautiful.

The temperatures were high during the visit so a mid-day break was perfect. Returning after 6 to drive the loop road again was perfect: wild horses, bison, deer, and elk were all out enjoying the lower temperatures.

Take lots of water and some food. Wear a hat and use sunscreen as most trails are exposed.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a park you rarely hear about but it offers so much. We spoke to a ranger who recommended the Pleasant Valley Trail. The trail requires crossing through the Little Missouri Scenic River twice along with creeks and since we had appropriate footwear with it provided the adventure we were looking for for our family of four (kids 12 and 13). We went after a rain so the trail was somewhat treacherous and due to the mud and slippery nature I would not recommend doing this trail after a rain again since there is a lot of up hill meaning lots of potential for injury if not careful (we all fell a couple times). That being said it was totally worth it. We ended up in a huge prairie dog town with hundreds of prairie dogs plus a herd of prong horn and amazing views. We felt totally alone here and a million miles from anywhere - it was amazing and is difficult to find in many parks. After our hike, we enjoyed the scenic loop with more amazing views along with bison and wild horses in the middle of the road. The park was not overly crowded and had more areas to be explored that we did not have time for. We can't wait to go back and explore both parts of the south unit and the north unit too.","July 24, 2018",Wow! A hidden gem of a park,36,"Sterling, Illinois",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt National Park was an amazing place to visit. The scenery is unlike anything I've ever seen and the wildlife was everywhere. As we drove to the park on the interstate from Bismarck we had grown tired of looking at farms and flat grassland. As we reached the visitor center we were amazed by the site of the Badlands. The landscape looks like it was made for pictures. As we explored the park over the next 4 days we came across prairie dogs, bison, wild horses, deer, pronghorn and snakes all in their natural setting. We were able to explore in solitude as if the park was there just for us as we rarely saw other people on the trails. After several days in the south unit, we traveled to the north unit and I wondered how different it could be. Again, I was blown away by how beautiful it was, and while there were similarities between the two units, each one was also unique. Tell people you are going to North Dakota for vacation and you will probably get some looks from people but I'm so glad we came here as it was a wonderful adventure.","July 20, 2018",Beautiful Landscapes and Animals In Nature,112,"Freeport, Pennsylvania",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We especially enjoyed the Painted Canyon and North Units, but the more popularly visited South Unit was also great. The drive in the North Unit was amazing. It is hard to beat the view at the Painted Canyon at Exit 32 from I-94.My brother in law and I hiked on three of the 1-2.5 miles hikes in the North Unit and one in the South Unit. In the North Unit, the Oxbow Overlook was AWESOME, as was the hike to Sperati Point from the terminus of the drive route. In the South Unit, we hiked the 3 miles to the Petrified Forest area.We saw many bison in the North Unit, some on the road as we drove, and one that we encountered while hiking. He was close enough for a good photograph, but we maintained a respectful distance for safety sake.We also had opportunities to catch good photos of wild horses.This park was not as insanely overcrowded as some of the more well known National Parks, and that added to our enjoyment.Overall, this was a very enjoyable retreat and place to relax and reflect.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"On our summer road trip, we stayed in the campgrounds at both north and south units of the park. We found out that camping in summer heat, without electricity or showers, can be challenging. The temps over 3 days ranged from mid to high nineties. If you tried to sit out in the shade, bugs attacked. Flies, gnats and mosquitoes mostly. Some folks seem not to be bothered. My wife and I have red itchy welts over any exposed skin, and some not so exposed. Be warned that tiny biting gnats, or no-see-ums, will get through tiny openings in hats and love to attack scalp. Bring repellent or protective clothing, as the whole point of being there is to be outdoors.  Before going, check the website for facilities, etc. For example both units have flush toilets, but only the north has an RV dump station. There were no fire rings, but there are raised charcoal grills that people made small fires in. We saw loads of poison ivy near the sites in the north unit, but not the south. The south has some reservable sites. Neither unit has any hookups for RVs. You can't even plug in a shaver or hair dryer in the bathrooms, and the tap water is cold. So people who stay for any length of time tend to have self-contained big RVs or portable generators. I use a battery with inverter and solar charger for running small things and charging phones, etc. The best thing about the parks is not the creature comfort. It is roughing it if you have a rent or small camper. The best thing is the beauty that surrounds you. That and the wildlife. From little prairie dogs and bunnies to majestic wild horses and enormous bison, it is hard to miss. We saw bison daily in both parks, sometimes in a distant herd; other time along or on the road. The horses and prairie dogs are only in the south unit, and that is where we also spotted a golden eagle. There are supposed to be bighorn sheep in the north unit, but I didn't see any. The best times for wildlife viewing seem to be early morning and late evening. We drove the roads several times, also looking for great light on the scenery. We were quite disappointed that two of the good scenery viewpoints are closed in the south unit. They are posted with signs warning of criminal trespass charges if you pass the sign to take a picture. If the viewpoints needed work, perhaps they could have closed one at a time. Most of us will only get to visit once in our lifetime.  Also, some of the roads are currently under construction or in need of it, like the first 4 miles entering the south unit.  Don't let any of the downsides deter you from coming. Just plan and prepare appropriately and you will have a great visit. Plan on more than a few hours or one day. The weather and wildlife don't always yield rewards the first attempt. Persistence and preparation will win out.","July 15, 2018",Summer camping in Teddy Roosevelt NP.,2,,4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"As I continue adding checkmarks to my ""All National Parks"" list, I stopped at TRNP on a road trip home from Yellowstone/Tetons; born and raised in SD (with an amazing Badlands park of our own), purely out of home-state loyalty I was totally prepared to be underwhelmed... then I arrived and it turns out TRNP is actually pretty wonderful :)The park has three sectors to it (drive-able between them but not actually linked by NP land). We did the South Sector (the one right off I-90) over several hours, leisurely driving the scenic loop at sunset. The landscape is dynamic (dry, yet so green this year, with mesa and hills and valleys and the classic wide open spaces you expect from Middle America). The wildlife opportunities are fantastic--we spotted a bazillion prairie dogs, elk, white tailed deer, bison, and an entire herd of beautiful wild horses.The scenic loop can be done well in two hours, and there are plenty of great hiking paths to help you fill more time if you have it. There are plenty of pulloffs for wandering, pictures, and animal-spotting (though the best ones were annoyingly under construction when we went). I've heard the camping is good and that the North sector is wonderful, too (I hope to get back there sometime soon).Lodging nearby in the touristy town of Mandan is plentiful, and prices are lower at nearby Dickinson if that's what you're looking for.Overall, definitely recommend getting yourself to TRNP (with your hiking shoes and camera!) to enjoy some of the Northern Plains beauty at its finest.","July 12, 2018",Surprisingly Great National Park,215,"Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a fantastic National Park with Natural beauty around every turn!We spent 2 days at the park, one in the North Unit and one in the South Unit. Each unit can easily be seen in 1 day. I would think it would be difficult to enjoy both units in one day.NORTH UNIT: It is completely worth the drive to see the North Unit! We went there first and the beauty of the badlands is unmatched. We were only about 100 yards into the park when we were greeted by a group of 5 bison right on the side of the road! We saw several other small groups of bison (between 3-6) throughout the park. The rock formations are gorgeous. We did the Caprock Coulee Nature Trail (grab a booklet at trailhead to read info at number markers. We also walked out part of the Buckhorn Trail to the prairie dog town (access from same parking/trailhead). We enjoyed this walk more than the Nature Trail. The prairie dogs had holes right in the trail! And they didn't seem very bothered by us being there. Note: There are restrooms at the visitor center AND in the picnic area. To access the public picnic area, take the road to the campground. It's not well marked, but it's there and it's a nice picnic area with clean restrooms.SOUTH UNIT: This unit has a much larger visitor center than the south unit. The loop drive is beautiful. I wish they had more areas to pull over and take pictures of the landscape. The unit offers several short trails. We hiked the Ridgeline Nature Trail, Coal Vein Trail, Boicourt Trail, and Wind Canyon Trail all in one day. Our favorites were Ridgeline and Coal Vein. At Coal Vein make sure to take a brochure from the trailhead, it had fascinating information about the Coal Vein to read at marked areas along the trail. Drive up the short road to Buck Hill for some of the most amazing views of the Badlands. Make sure to take the little path to the top - it's steep but SO worth it!Also Note: The North Unit is on Central Time and the South Unit is on Mountain Time.","July 10, 2018",Beautiful Park,82,"Palm Harbor, Florida",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"thanks for reading.I need to divide this review into two parts as we did the south unit which was great but also drove out to Elkhorn ranch (Roosevelt ranch site) and would give that one star. We knew the original ranch was gone but as teddy fans and we were happy just to see the location. However the problems with Elkhorn are many a) the site is tick infested. Don‚Äôt go unless you have 40%+ DEET and even then, wear long pants. B) The location is a huge disappointment. Although near the river, the river is fenced off with no access. At the site pretty much no view at all. C) The directions on the park map are totally insufficient. You‚Äôll need to download the google maps (there and back) b4 you leave the interstate as there is no cell signal once you are off the highway. D) You‚Äôll be passed by multiple oil trailers with the stones and dust that involves. E) There is absolutely no signage so again, make sure you have google maps. On dirt roads its takes over an hour to get there and then you have a 2 mile roundtrip hike thru the tick infested grass so it‚Äôs a huge time suck. In summary, unless this is an emotional pilgrimage, do not bother. Make do with seeing his cabin at the visitor‚Äôs center. As for the rest of the south Unit, beautiful. This is where to spend your time but if you are after animals then go early morning (or better yet) late afternoon (we saw mustang, elk, rabbits, mule deer and Coyote). During the rest of the day you will only get bison and prairie dogs. Spend the mid-day hours by the pool or perhaps drive to the north unit to see the scenery. But what ever you do, skip elkhorn.","July 9, 2018",4 stars BUT read this review b4 you go,239,pennsylvania,4

Also, if you are planning on going to more than one national park (or go back to same one repeatedly), recommend the annual pass, which is $80.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This was the 11th national park we have visited over the last 4 years and one of the more unique and enjoyable. We only visited the south unit which can easily be done in 5 - 6 hrs, longer if you want to explore a little more. In reading some of the other reviews I understand the frustration with the construction - in the south unit during work days they are rebuilding a large portion of the road. There is only one way in and as a result they have a pilot car that cycles leading a group through, turning around and repeating. If you miss the pilot you may have to wait as long as 15 min for the next grouping but, as frustrating as it mayseem, it is a necessity because of the length and scale of the project. My take is it is great to see them being proactive and taking care of bettering the park for future visitors. This info is clearly posted on the parks home page and for those that complain about the fees, they are the same for every single national park or national historic site in the country. Best bet is to buy an annual pass for $80 and you don't have to sweat the daily fees for a year. The area itself is magnificent - the scenic loop drive is 36 miles and depending on the number of stops can be done in an hour or so or several. We loved the numerous, short trails that lead to beautiful views. The Ridgeline Trail was one of our favorites but Coal Vein trail, Buck Hill and Wind Canyon Trail were all worth the stop. Only one we didn't do which we wish we had was the Old East Entrance. The visitors center near Medora was great - some shaded spots for a picnic, great movie introducing the park and the rangers there were very helpful in planning some hikes. Lot of wildlife - especially prairie dog towns. We did the loop counterclockwise and saw most of the buffalos toward the end in a big herd against the Little Missouri River though we saw a few stray ones along the rock formations earlier in the ride. This park may not pack the big wow factor that Grand Canyon, Yellowstone or Yosemite does but it was not very crowded at all (we had several trails to ourselves) and the views and scenary were breathtaking and thoroughly enjoyable. One thing to keep in mind - not a lot in Medora. Even the gas station there, though reasonably priced, used an old, analog pump (hadn't seen or used one like that in over 30 years!). Make sure you gas up before you head into the park and plan ahead for food. Nearest real civilization is about 30 miles away in Dickinson, ND.","July 5, 2018",Thoroughly enjoyed it,63,"Alpharetta, Georgia",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This place absolutely exceeded my expectations. North Dakota was the 49th of the 50th state that I have been to and I suppose it's because the state doesn't have a lot of attractions. Well, when you visit ND you need to stop here.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I had the absolute best time at this park for two days. I don't even know where to begin!Let me first address the complaints on the construction. First, I think part of it is luck. We were in the South Unit multiple times on two days. The longest we waited was five minutes. The other times we drove through were no wait (during the day, even, and they stop working at night). However, the NPS page for TRNP clearly states there will be long delays under ""alerts."" There is also a huge sign regarding this matter at the gate before you pay that you can't possibly miss, so you can decide if you want to pay and enter or turn around. From what I have heard from rangers, the roads were deplorable before and this is desperately needed. How do they fund stuff like this? From our fee dollars. The national parks are absolutely something we should be happy to invest in.We visited both the South and North Units. The South Unit is a much longer drive and it's a loop. 36 miles and you can drive it either way. This takes about 90 min to drive straight through without hiking and minimal stops. We did the Ridgeline Trail, The Boicourt Trail, and the Wind Canyon Trail, as well as a short walk through a prairie dog town. Our first afternoon was very hot and we saw minimal wildlife. Our second day was cooler and we had the most amazing wildlife encounters! In the afternoon, near the Upper Jones Creek Trailhead, we saw a huge herd of buffalo including babies from about 100 yards away. We saw even more near Boicourt Trail, running right across the road. Both nights we were in Medora we drove to the park for sunset. The first evening we had a lightning storm come through (cool in its own way if you view from the safety of your vehicle). The second night we not only had a sunset, but had buffalo grazing mere feet from our car on the side of the road. They ran right in front of our car! How humbling to come mere feet from a 2000 lb animal and look them in the eye. Our planet is amazing! We also saw several wild horses, prairie dogs, a fox, and some huge elk during our time in the South Unit. If you have only one day for TRNP, I would probably do the South Unit. You can go in the visitor center and read the board to find out where wildlife has been spotted that day.We also drove a little over an hour up to the North Unit. This is less-visited and more rugged and wild. Be prepared that the only restrooms are at the visitor center. This scenic drive is an out-and-back and 14 miles long. We didn't do much hiking, but we stopped at all the overlooks. I do think the North Unit has the most amazing views. We also saw a few buffalo. The real gem of this unit is the solitude. Yes, we did see some other people, but at each overlook maybe only one other person was there with us.I would happily come back to TRNP over and over again. This is an amazing park that many people don't visit and it's a shame.","July 3, 2018",This park is an absolute gem. Magical!,228,"Peoria, Illinois",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Wow! What a terrific place. The ranger advised early morning or evening visit to see the most wildlife so we went at 7:30 pm and were amazed at what we saw.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My husband and I visited in June, 2018. We were coming home to Ohio from the West Coast and thought we would stop, since we love the National Parks. This was above and beyond our expectations. We stopped at the visitor center and saw the movie. We spoke with a ranger about wildlife and which hikes to take. Ranger was very helpful. We wound up taking a wrong turn, so did a scenic driving route. We did stop to hike up to the top of Buck Hill and the view from on top was fantastic. (Short, 10 minute hike from the parking lot of the trail to the top of the viewpoint.) We were able to see Prairie Dogs galore. We saw a wild horse right at roadside and saw a group on the mountain side. Saw several individual bison and also saw two herd of bison.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Our first stop was at the free Visitor Center just off I-94 just east of the Medora exit. Spectacular views - everyone passing by should swing in to this stop for an enjoyable break. We officially entered TR National Park at the south entry in Medora. There were two of us in the car, and as one was over 62 years old, we purchased a one year national park pass for $20. Be sure to stop in at the visitor center to watch the 17 minute film about the Park history. We then took the 38 mike loop drive. It took about 2 hours with a few viewing stops. There are many places you can also stop and hike. Be sure to reference the map you‚Äôre given upon entry, so you can note where you are. Construction caused about a 30 minute delay, but we enjoyed talking to the construction ‚Äúflag‚Äù person. We saw 7 wild horses, a herd of buffalo (off in distance), and many prairie dogs. This trip through was about 10 - Noon. The next morning, we returned at 7 am - then saw 4 deer, 1 mule deer, many prairie dogs, and 2 buffalo close up! One even crossed the road in front of our car! The early morning visit was worth getting up early for. The Park is open 24 hours!","June 28, 2018",Bully! What a beautiful National Park!,21,"Plato, Minnesota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"At $30 a car, it should have been more pleasurable on a quiet Tuesday (June 26th 2018) afternoon. It wasn't. What I don't understand is the unbelievable amount of construction going on in the park on the relatively short loop. At least 3 of the scenic lookouts were closed completely (nobody working on them) and quite a lot of roadway that was unpaved with construction markers all over making driving tricky. After the loop towards the end - there was a guy in yellow jacket that stopped cars for a good 10 minutes while they did something and then let cars through one lane at a time.Look if I wanted to spend a day avoiding construction and waiting for workers to let you pass the cones, I would have stayed in (name your urban city) and not been in the great outdoors of ND. Granted this may be find for hikers and there looked to be some good trails to hike, I was driving. But with the sonic overlooks closed and views that were frankly similar to what was a the free beautiful highway rest stop further up the highway, it was not significantly more spectacular. Yes there were buffalo and some wild horses in the park, and they are fun to see.... but there are better elsewhere.Look - I get parks need work, but how about warning folks this might be the case right now? How about dropping the rates while this disruptive work is going on? How about working on one section at a time to minimize the overall impact. I went to Devils Tower a few days prior and due to it being cloudy and raining, it was a ""free day"" and the park was amazing. This one keeps the same steep prices and then makes the journey irritating bringing a little bit of city annoyance to an otherwise serene park experience. Felt it was not time or money well spent.","June 27, 2018",Rip off... $30,104,"Denver, Colorado",2

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"If you look this place up you‚Äôll find a lot of great reviews and beautiful pictures...non of which do the actual experience any justice. If you have to travel across the country to see it then do it, it‚Äôs worth the journey. We camped a few minutes away at Sully Creek state park because TRNP was full. Sully was a great place that caters to horse owners who can bring their horses and go riding through the badlands. During the day we toured TRNP. The two days we spent in Medora were incredible. We were all super pumped at the sheer awesomeness of the whole place.Something that the other reviews don‚Äôt say though is the ticks here are crazy. Before arriving in Medora we stayed for a couple days an hour away at Fort Lincoln state park. Spent hours walking grassy fields and no ticks. The two days we were in Medora we found six ticks, one we pulled out of the back of our son‚Äôs head. We were careful to avoid long grass and kept a close eye on the kids as well.

We ran out of time or we would have spent another hour or two on some longer hikes.We also spent around 3 hours in the North Unit. We drove the main road and did some short hikes., including a nature trail that was very informative. (We also had a great lunch at JL Beers in Watford City.)

The scenery is a great blend of Badlands and Prairie, which attracts an abundance of wildlife. The Prairie Dogs were out in force, and very active, despite the heat (temperature reached 91). There were plenty of Bison as well- numerous photo ops. I also was lucky enough to encounter a trio of wild horses a mile or so from the gate. What a great day that was.

There is a gift shop and information as wells as bathrooms. Our main goal was to drive the scenic drive of the South Unit. The entrance is located in a cute cowboy style town called Medora. When we arrived we were told that there was road construction going on in the state park and we could experiance delays. This was on a Wednesday and almost immediately outside of the parking lot we were stopped as the road was torn up and one lane. We waited about 20 minutes for the lead car to bring the people in the opposite direction down and then to lead us up. Unfortuantely because of the road construction we did not have enough time to drive the whole route. Right after the the construction we started towards the Skyline Vista Trail and was greeted by a bison on the road. He was not the largest one that I have seen but still impressive. After he passed we continued on and walked the short trail at Skyline Vista. We then started towards Wind Canyon Trail. Along the way there were many prairie dogs and we got out to view many of them. They were fun to watch and all of my children wanted to bring them home as pets. We stopped along the way to walk trails and only made it to Wind Canyon. And then we had to turn around because the youngest had to use the bathroom. Again on our way back down we had a wait, only about 10 minutes but it seemed like an eternity when a child is crying that she is going to pee her pants. We will be making a trip back to explore this park further at another time.

Teddy Roosevelt eventually would write three books about his ranching days. More importantly, he would as President, preserve over 230 million acres. Such places as Yosemite, Mesa Verde and Crater Lake were protected. From the Visitors Center is a 36 mile loop road through the Painted Canyon. We were treated to seeing wild horses, thousands of Prairie Dogs and free roaming herds of bison. There were a number of vistas that presented superb photo opportunities.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Visiting Teddy Roosevelt NP was a surprising, and enlightening experience. We spent nearly an entire afternoon traversing the 36 mile scenic loop of the South Unit, located adjacent to Medora, ND. The Badlands topography is unique and attractive for travelers who love new places. The rolling hills, barren exposures as opposed to the usual heavily wooded NPs was something to see. The many Prairie Dog towns and wild Buffaloes make the venture more fun. Hiking the dozen shorter walks like the paved Skyline Vista is only a twenty minute mild jaunt with the result of a breath-taking scene of many peaks and valleys from the Park's highest point. If you love our National Parks, then you would live this one, complete with a tour of the Roosevelt's cabin, which has been relocated to the park entrance in Medora. But if you go, bring food, snacks, and water, as there are no venues for those, especially on a hot summer afternoon. Also we learned that when we travel to many US National Parks as seniors, we can gain free entry with a simple senior pass which we received at the park's entrance, and which we used over again at other stops on our two week trip.","February 1, 2018",Discovering A Lesser-Known National Park,123,"Ave Maria, Florida",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Stopped in on our way to Glacier. I was expecting something like Badlands National Park. And it was, but somehow more spectacular. We rolled in our first night, set up camp, ate dinner, and then I went to watch a sunset with my oldest son (4 at the time). We shared the sunset watching with a bison. It was an unforgettable experience.The next day, we drove the loop, stopping to do several short hikes or to climb short trails to the tops of landforms to take in the view. It was far more stunning that I could have imagined. I was expecting to find a box to check off as ""I'd been here"", instead I found one of my favorite National Parks (and I've been to 29 of them!). On the back end, we ran into a large herd of bison, which we sat and watched from the car, our four year old in ecstasy over seeing them so close. Another big hit was Teddy Roosevelt's cabin by the visitors center.I also can't recommend the Junior Ranger Program, our older one loved it, and learned more about the park than he would have by doing it.That night, we camped again. Our site was on the edge of the campground, with a fantastic view from the picnic table of the hills.Our third day, we packed up and headed for the North Unit of the park. This one was nearly empty, and the views were even more spectacular than the South Unit. This one is also more rugged, as the visitors center is NOT big or fancy. It also seems to receive far fewer visitors, so come here to avoid the crowds. We were even held up by bison in the parking lot, as they got between the visitors center and our car, and we had to wait them out. It was great.My only disappointment was that there weren't any Ranger programs in the campground the two nights we spent there, which are one my very favorite parts of camping in national parks.","January 17, 2018",One of my favorite National Parks,171,South Jersey,5

It was in the morning about 10:00. I didn't see any prairie dogs up, nor any tracks, so I think the prairie dogs may have all been hibernating. Mostly what I like about this park is the ruggedness of the scenery. It has some great trails too but I cut one hike short today because there was a herd of bison near the trail. Better to be safe than sorry, right? I did take another trail which was a very nice hike.","December 7, 2017",Awesome park. Always something new to see here.,10,Colstrip,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,The park has 2 units which you need to take a day to do each one. the south unit has a lot of prairie dog towns and wild mustangs. We also saw buffalo.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent a month touring the US national parks; this was our favorite. Seems most of the crowd haven't heard of Theodore. Our admiration for Teddy was reflected in the park's visitor center. The trails are well-maintained but not overly modernized. Wildlife abounds - bison, antelope, beaver, coyote, and of course the adorable prairie dog. Such a greener version of the Badlands in South Dakota. The primary campground is situated along the river in a cottonwood grove - very pretty. The entire park reminded us of the national parks from the 80s - maybe a little too old-fashioned for some visitors but exactly what we like. If you only have a few hours break from the interstate, take the time and at least do the drive through the park. Sunset hour is unearthly beautiful.","November 15, 2017",Best park in the Dakotas,62,Kansas,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I love love l o v e d it here. The park has a surprising amount of variety in the landscape - rock formation and grassland and tree, all of which you can readily see while driving through it. Also a great amount of wildlife which you can actually see; so many prairie dogs, birds and even the odd pronghorn. Wonderful hiking trails of differing difficulty, even the easiest of which lead to incredible, stunning views: we hiked the Wind Canyon and Boicourt trails, and at the end of the latter we were able to gaze down from a mountain top at a whole herd of bison!Compared to the Badlands National Park in South Dakota, this park has more variety in scenery, more hiking trails, and simply makes you feel more involved; while driving through it you don't just stare at big rock formations from afar, you feel the nature and the life within it, you become part of it almost, you explore. It's more personal. In my opinion, it is the superior park in the Dakotas.Things from the gift shop are quite nice, albeit very expensive. I would love to return there and hike more trails, as well as see the nature at different times of the year. An absolutely unique and unforgettable experience, would recommend to anyone and everyone!","November 13, 2017",Absolutely breathtaking,32,"Konstancin-Jeziorna, Poland",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"First...Theodore Roosevelt National Park is green. It has foliage, and at the time we were there in September, the trees were already turning yellow. Very pretty. Starting from the Visitors Center, there is a loop that goes through the park, taking about 90 minutes depending on how many stops you make along the way. It winds along the ""valley"" floor between the colorful hills and mounds of rock. Much to our delight we saw a host of animals from a badger to wild mustangs and several herds of buffalo. All were close-up and did not need binoculars to see. They seem to have a healthy animal population. The park was not as hot as the South Dakota Badlands, nor as desolate. Restroom facilities along the loop, but no food...if I remember correctly. Camp grounds available as are hiking trails. It was well worth the visit...very glad we made the effort.","November 11, 2017",Different from the Bad Lands of South Dakota,143,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5

There were hundred if not thousands of very cute prairie dogs, many deer even a mother deer feeding it fawn and loads of bison. The bison would be standing in the road and you would have to wait for them to move so you could move. We saw on young coyote chasing something but he didn't get it. There was one wild horse that we saw. And some wild turkeys. It was a great place to see was so glad that we came across this park and decided to go through.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt NP is remote, not many visitors come here. But it is worth while a visit; it is even nicer than Badlands in South Dokata. Unfortunately, there is no lodging. Most hotels are at Dickinson, a half an hour drive. Medora is closer but has a small number of hotels (expensive too). The park consists of 2 units, the larger South Unit, located direct at freeway I-94. The North Unit is half an hour driving north. Through both parks, the Little Missouri River is flowing. Best visit the 2 units on 2 separate days to fully experience the beauty and to do some hikes. We did the 4.2 mile Caprock Coulee trail with a large variety of landscapes (woodlands, prairy, bare rock), but there are many others. The South Unit has a scenic 35 mile loop drive.

We were able to see a lot of buffalo, wild horses, prairie dogs of course and a few porcupines walking down the road at night. If its wild life your looking for, a great place to see it.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt National Park is quiet, isolated and absolutely beautiful! Here you‚Äôll find the Badlands of North Dakota, which are greener and just as dramatic as the dryer, harsher ones of South Dakota. That alone would make this a great place to camp and hike. But honoring Theodore Roosevelt and his legacy of conservation make this a must stop for any lover of national parks. TR spent several years around Medora, ND as a cowboy, hunter, and rancher and from this experience, he affirmed his great love of the outdoors and began his understanding of the need to save America‚Äôs wild lands and wild creatures (bison in particular). Speaking of bison, this is the place to see them if you didn‚Äôt find them in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming or in the Black Hills of South Dakota. We stayed in Cottonwoods Campground which is in the southern unit and is the closest to the visitor‚Äôs center and historical areas, including the loop road with many great short hikes and views to the Little Missouri River. (There is also a north unit with its own loop road and campground but we did not venture there.) Cottonwoods Campground is one of the more beautiful campgrounds in the National Park Service because the rangers have left it to nature ‚Äî so you are surrounded by cliffs, river, cottonwood trees and prairie grass. It is so natural that we were visited by a flock of wild turkeys every day and on one memorable afternoon saw a herd of wild horses graze through the campground until early evening; bison are also known to visit the campground as evident from the large ‚Äúpats‚Äù or ‚Äúchips‚Äù. Of the two visitor‚Äôs centers the one by Cottonwood Campground has more to offer - a short film, museum and gift store plus the Maltese Cabin, which is one of TR‚Äôs ranch buildings. The visitor‚Äôs center off I-94 at Paintbrush Canyon had a gift store but the reason for visiting it is the great view of the canyon, which is one of the more colorful areas of the park. There are also some short hikes with their trailheads here. The loop road (which starts just beyond Cottonwood Campground) is the best way to see wildlife and to get in some short hikes. Here are the 3 trails that we walked (all less than half a mile roundtrip): 1. Wind River Canyon - my favorite for the views of the sculpted cliffs as you walk along the top of them and the sight of the meandering Little Missouri River at the bottom of the valley. 2. Boiscourt - more dramatic views of the Badlands with sculpted hoodoos at the bottom of the cliffs. 3. Buck Hill - the second highest point in the park (the highest is only 5 feet taller) from where you can get a panoramic view of the badlands - it‚Äôs windy! We were lucky to cross a herd of a dozen bison with 3 calves on the loop road - usually this time of September the herds are in the interior and you usually only find a solitary male bison grazing near the road. We also sighed several wild horses, pronghorns, a coyote or two and of course the ubiquitous prairie dog towns. There are longer trails within the park, but we did not have the time (nor anymore the young bones and energy) to attempt them. This is a great place for getting away from it all, and you can get backcountry permits for camping in the badlands - just make sure to take along good maps, a compass and plenty of water. Be warned that the town of Medora just about shuts down after Labor Day. You will only find a convenience store, gas station, couple of restaurants and one or two gift shops open. One really great store is the book and music store ‚Äî The Western Edge Book Store ‚Äî it had the best collection of western books I‚Äôve ever seen. Some older reviews of TRNP call it one of the less visited national parks and the campground wide open for casual stays - this is not true anymore. TRNP gets plenty of visitors in the summer and well into the fall and unless you‚Äôre a tenter, you should make reservations at the campground. None of the campsites have electricity but they do allow you to use generators during the day. All sites are close to a water spigot. The bathrooms have flush toilets and cold water.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited this park as part of a week long loop that included the Black Hills/Custer State Park, Badlands, Mt. Rushmore, Crazy Horse and Devil's Tower. The scenery in the Northern Unit, especially the Oxbow Overlook (with the Fall color) was spectacular. We saw more wildlife overall in Badlands, but here we saw several small groups of wild horses, a few bison and of course several prairie dog towns. The southern unit was closer to our lodgings in Medora, but compared to Badlands N.P. The scenery was not as impressive. If you are a big T.R. fan you can't miss the Maltese Cross cabin at the visitor center in Medora, or the interesting visitor center in Medora (southern unit). While planning our trip we debated whether to drive the 75 minutes each way to the northern unit, then spend another hour plus on the loop and another 75 minutes on the return, but it was worth it and we easily did the northern unit, southern unit and painted canyon all in one day, with time to walk around Medora before dinner. Even if you aren't a history buff or know little about Roosevelt, you will be impressed with his adventures in the Dakota Territory (explained in excellent displays in the southern unit).

After a little research, we planned a stop in Medora to visit the park on our return trip. What interested us was the 39 mile Scenic Loop Drive that the park offers. We were not disappointed. We were travelling from a car meet with a '50s convertible in our luggage and a perfect day for a drive in the park. The badlands are beautiful and there are a number of short hikes that were fun to do. Our favourite was the bison herd that roamed freely adjacent to the road. Medora is also a great visit.

We saw feral horses, bison, lots of birds, and a coyote!The North unit is far less visited and is pretty rustic. The road is 14 miles out and 14 miles back. Very few facilities - but proper planning makes it work. The rock formations are very unusual - you get a great sense of Mother Nature and the geology of the area. We saw lots of bison in the park including a group of 30+ crossing the road right in front of us. We also saw lots of prairie dogs in both units.

The park is open 24h and if the ranger station isn't open, you can pay via the honor system at their drop box. I entered the North Unit at 0830 and covered the entire park in about an hour, pulling off at most overlooks to take pictures. There was barely anyone else there. Very peaceful.Next, I drove an hour to the South Unit. I recommend filling up on gas at the one gas station along this drive. If you wait until you get to Medora, you run the risk of waiting in line to access 2 pumps at the town's sole, semi-vintage gas station where you have to leave your credit cards inside and go in to make the transaction after pumping.I didn't stop for lunch and completed the South Unit by 1430 ish. If I wanted to, I could have easily added 6-8 miles of hiking into the same day. In comparing this park to other NPs I have visited, I cannot go higher than a '3'' rating. Although I thought it was beautiful and enjoyed being here, it does not have enough wow factors to compete with the 'big boys' of NPs.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent two days exploring TRNP - one day seeing the South Unit plus the Painted Canyon area and the second day in the North Unit. We spent the night after the first day in Medora at Badlands Motel and the night after the second day in Watford City at the Roosevelt Inn. We saw more wildlife in the South Unit (wild horses, bison, prairie dogs and mule deer). In the North Unit, we only saw one lone male bison, but we enjoyed the solitude of the North Unit. The Painted Canyon area was the most crowded of the three areas, since it is right off the interstate and it is free. For the other areas, the cost is $25 for a 7 day pass, which is good for both North and South Units. Compared to other large National Parks we have been to (Glacier, Yellowstone, Smoky Mountain, Grand Canyon, the Utah parks), we found TRNP even at the height of summer season to be refreshingly uncrowded. In the South Unit, late in the afternoon, we cautiously followed a male bison walking on the yellow line about a mile on the Scenic Loop Drive and not one car came from the other way the entire time and only two cars came up from behind us. In Yellowstone, this would have caused a huge bison jam with 30 cars in each direction, tourists running from their cars with cameras and three park rangers trying to keep them safe. Other than in the Visitor Centers, we saw no park rangers while in the park. Take some snacks and lots of water, even if you are just driving around and don't plan to be hiking, as there are few facilities beyond the visitor centers. You can fill up water at the campgrounds and we found one pit toilet on the Scenic Loop Drive in the South Unit. The Visitor Center at Painted Canyon has a small store and a few displays, bathrooms, and water. The Visitor Center at the South Unit has a film (we recommend), several exhibits, Roosevelt's Maltese Cross cabin, and a gift shop along with restrooms and water. The North Unit Visitor Center is just a trailer - good to stop and ask any questions, get your NP passport stamped or get a map, but not much else other than porta potties. It was very hot and very dry the two days we visited in late July; luckily, there was an almost constant breeze. We were a family of four with a 10 and 13 year old, so we mostly did the overlooks and the drives with a few walks. Unfortunately, there aren't many short hikes in either unit. We did the Painted Canyon Trail, which starts near the picnic pavilions at the opposite end of the parking lot from the Painted Canyon Visitor Center. This is a well marked loop that is 0.9 miles if you stay on the main trail, but you can make it longer by taking some of the side paths (we were on it for a little over an hour, because we did take several side paths). You start at the top of a cliff and work your way down to the canyon floor - so this is steep at the end and the beginning, but fairly flat in between, unless you choose to clamber up one of the rocky areas once down to the floor. Take water and wear a hat and sunscreen, as it can be dusty and there isn't much shade. In the South Unit, we drove the 36 mile Scenic Loop drive with several stops for wildlife and overlooks and we also took a few short walks and this took us 4 hours. The short trail to the old East Entrance Station is very flat and goes through a prairie dog town. Buck Hill is not really a trail, but a very steep walkway with several stairs to a great overlook (you are seeing the other side of the Painted Canyon from the Painted Canyon Visitors Center). The Biocourt Trial is also very short; takes you out to a point where you are looking down into a canyon. Wind Canyon is a quick loop that takes you to a point to see a bend in the Little Missouri River. In the North Unit, we drove the Scenic Drive (14 miles out and 14 miles back) mid-day and spent about 4 hours. We walked the Caprock Coulee Nature Trail (1.6 miles out and back) - there are brochures at the trail head that tell you about the things you see on the hike. Some of this trail was shaded, but most is not, so take water with you. We also did the Little Mo Nature Trail, but found this one not very interesting and can't really recommend it. We did enjoy going down to the river near the entrance to the Juniper campground (the beginning of the South Achenbach Trail) and wading in the river/mud (it is really muddy, so plan footware accordingly) and looking at all the animal tracks. There is a nice picnic area with restrooms (but no water spigot that we could find) near the Juniper campground, too. In the North Unit, you are mostly on the floor of the badlands, looking up at the formations. In the South Unit, you are on top of the badlands, looking down -- so there is a difference in the two units from that perspective.","August 27, 2017","Great wildlife viewing, amazing badlands scenery and thankfully not crowded",207,Maryland,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We went to TRNP primarily because my husband is a huge TR fan and has read a number of biographies on him. We arrived from the north (Williston) and went first through the North Unit, although many reviews had said all the activity was South Unit. North Unit consists of a 14 mile in-and-out scenic road. There were a couple of very beautiful overlooks. We didn't do any of the hiking, just short walks from the overlook. Great views of the Missouri River. We saw a herd of bison on our way out--lucky, because we did not see any in the South Unit. The Visitor's Center in the North Unit was not much (the restrooms were port-a-potties).After checking into our hotel in Medora, we explored the South Unit, making the entire loop drive. First, we checked out the Visitor's Center (very nice, small museum) and the Maltese Cross Cabin. We hiked on the Coal Vein Trail--quite interesting (where the lignite burned beneath the ground for about 25 years) although not as strikingly beautiful as other parts of the park. The CV Trail is in a sunken area which collapsed as a result of the fire. We did the Buck Hill Trail, which is short but steep and leads to a really spectacular overlook, and Boicourt Overlook Trail, where we hoped to (but did not) see elk migrating.There were several prairie dog towns along the loop. They were more active earlier (around 3pm) than later (6pm), which surprised me. Then we wound up the day at the Cottonwood Campground, where Ranger Brian gave a good 70-minute talk about Teddy Roosevelt's life.

Rushmore or Yellowstone, but it is spectacular in its own right. I was blown away watching the introductory movie at the Visitor Center before driving into the park. It gave me an education on Teddy Roosevelt---who he was and why he was important. It was ironic that as some things always change they always remain the same. In the 1900s, Congress refused to bring in the Grand Canyon (and others) under Federal Protection. Teddy Roosevelt, by Executive Order, created protections for them, pointing out in the process that greed and industry were a clear and present danger to the wonders of the world. Through his efforts so many of our National Park Lands were created.","August 22, 2017","A very wonderful park to visit, especially the pre-park visit Movie in the Visitor Center",270,Cincinnati Ohio,5

I've been to many National Parks and I really, really enjoyed this one. There are a lot of short hikes and options for extending the hike, so if you go out on a loop and the kids are cranky and complaining about sore feet, you can cut the hike from 1.8 miles to 0.8 miles - very nice for a younger family. The loop tour is great - the rangers will tell you it takes 2-3hrs but if you want to do it right it should take you 2/3 of a day. Spend the last 1/3 day and drive out of the park up to the Petrified Forest trail head - the trail is absolutely gorgeous particularly in the late afternoon, hiking through the waving golden grass. We saw all the park's ""great"" animals - elk, bison, mustangs, mule deer, and of course the prairie dogs.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The National Park Service list this as one of their least known parks but one of the best ones to see. I agree. It contains plenty of wildlife and spectacular views of the North Dakota Badlands. They are totally different from the South Dakota Badlands. We only took the south loop scenic drive. There are two others. We saw plenty of buffalo and beautiful wild horses. One had just had a colt a few days earlier and we loved watching them together. You can travel the south loop in about two hours, including stopping for numerous pictures along the way. Don't forget to visit the Painted Canyon Overlook located off the interstate. It has some of the best views around. ","August 16, 2017",Great hidden gem,61,"Nashville, Tennessee",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,This park is one of the less traveled national parks. But its worth is if you can manage to get here. I only visited the southern section of the park and really liked it. I did 3 short hikes. Ridgeline trail had very nice views over bad lands of ND. Coal vein trail goes to a coal vein section which was burnt in past. The auto guide booklet was very interesting in regards to the whole process of burning of the coal veins. Beef coral pullout gave a nice opportunity to look at the little Missouri river. The river was running very low when I visited but I would only imagine how beautiful it would be when the river is high especially around sunset. This was a very nice park and would be worth a visit for sure. I enjoyed my day visit here and will return if in the area again.,"August 15, 2017",Secluded and beautiful,55,"Portland, Oregon",5

But, if you have the time, go to the Northern part of the park. It's a little over an hour north but has completely different scenery and we actually saw bison closer there than in the south. Both parts are worth the stop, but I'd skip the Teddy Roosevelt cabin and just take the time for the drive through the park.

We were stopped on the road by a large herd of buffalo for some time. It was fun to take pictures from the opened car window. They seemed to be going the same direction we wanted to go so it did slow us down quite a bit. MDH passed several cars looking longer than we wanted to and that helped us keep on schedule.

We went late to see more animals and I mean 7:00-7:30 pm. We saw the most animals during the evening when it's cooler. We saw deer, prong horn, feral horses, prairie dogs, and a badger.

At the park we took the loop drive and walked to the top of Buck Hill - our favorite place in the park.

I like both the south and north units about the same as far as scenic quality, but the south loop is 36 miles long while the north is a one-way street that is 14 miles long. So if you can only do one, do the South. I also suggest going after it cools down; the park says they are open 24 hours a day, but I imagine you have to buy your pass during visitor center hours?? It gets very hot in the summer so I enjoyed the twilight visit more than the middle of the day.

TRNP is located on the western edge of North Dakota about 35 miles from the Montana Border and about 335 miles west of Fargo, ND. This Park is really two parks separated by about 70 miles of National Grassland. The South Unit of the park is located on I-94 with the main entrance in the town of Medora, ND. The North Unit is 70 miles north and is smaller and has fewer visitors. The main attraction in this park is the hikes and views of the North Dakota Badlands and the wild animals (including about 400 bison and lots of wild horses). I visited both units of this Park with my entire family on a weekend in mid-June and really enjoyed it. We went on a few hikes and drove the scenic drives in both the North and South Units. My favorite hike was the 4.2 mile Caprock-Coulee Trail (especially the last mile if you hike this loop counterclockwise). This trail is located in the North Unit. I actually liked the North Unit better than the South Unit. I also liked stopping at the Painted Canyon Visitor Center in the South Unit, right off of I-94. There is a cost to enter this National Park but you can stop at this Visitor Center for free and hike the 2 trails that start there. The views of the Painted Canyon of the Badlands from the Visitor Center are fantastic.Overall I really enjoyed this National Park and think it is one of the more underrated National Parks in the US. I also enjoyed seeing a large herd of Bison near the end of the scenic drive in the North Unit (but they ae not always in this spot). If you visit TRNP I recommend that you get a list of hikes and make sure that you go on at least one of them.","July 4, 2017",Underrated National Park,833,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The park pass is a bit expensive ($25) but it is unlimited ins and outs for 7 days, both the northern and the southern units, and for as many people as you have in your vehicle. The drive around the southern unit took us 2 or 3 hours (I didn't look at my watch when we started), because you drive slowly and you stop often. It is common for wild horses or buffalo to wander into the road, and you have to stop and wait for them to pass. Don't be in a hurry....it should be a leisure event.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We specifically visited this NP because of the wild horse here in the south unit. We were not disappointed. There is also a large herd of bison. Rugged country. Many trails. The north unit is located about 60 miles north and is extremely rugged. There one can glimpse bison, elk, big horn sheep, mountain lions, bobcat, deer and the ever present prairie dog. Well worth visiting.","July 1, 2017",Exceeded Expectations,32,,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is one of the reasons we stop at medora besides the musical. For some reason the town does not support this national park the way it should. That's my opinion. We were driving back from the west so stayed in Glendive Montana for $99 bucks, instead of the $220 a night in medora. If you want to see good wildlife you need to see them at dawn or dusk. On that note Glendive is 60 miles away. But yes we did get up at 5am and got to the park at 6:25am. During the summer dawn is 5:45am and dusk is 9:45pm!!!!! This park is beautiful. We saw at least 100 bison and there babies on the prairie. It was a North Dakota picture for sure. Then we went on one of the gravel roads and up the hill right on the road side were 5 wild horses. They were staying in a circle and in the middle was a foal. That was magnificent. The thing you notice the most is how quiet and I mean quiet the park is. President Roosevelt wrote how peaceful the park was and how he wouldn't have become president if it wasn't for the peaceful prairies of North Dakota. Lots and lots of prairie dogs. We also saw a male pronghorn and his lady friends with babies. When we turned a corner on this 36 mile road we looked up the ridge and on top was an elk!!!!! One thing to keep in mind is there is one bathroom in the whole park. Not to user friendly so what how much you drink. I could go on and on and on. Do the 36 mile drive listen to peace and quiet and relax. ","July 1, 2017",Awesome,47,Minnesota,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This National Park is in very rugged country, but extremely beautiful. We camped 2 days in the Cottonwood campground in the South unit. In the early evening we drove part of the loop and hike the Wind Canyon trail to the overlook of the Little Missouri River. There we saw a herd of about 200 bison grazing and drinking along the river bank. It was an awesome sight! The next day we saw a smaller herd along the loop drive, as well as 8 to 10 wild horses roaming the hills. There is a lot of wildlife to be seen along the loop drive, and the scenery is magnificent. Since the park is right by the quaint town of Medora, it's convenient to go for supplies, a meal, ice cream and souvenirs. There's also a lot to do there, but that's another review.","June 30, 2017",Huge Bison herd and wild horses,77,"Cape Girardeau, Missouri",5

We were disappointed in the lack of animals that were seen, we noticed one bison and a group of wild horses, but no elk or bison herds. The park also has a petrified forest, which involves a drive down an unpaved road and then about a half mile walk which some would consider steep.","June 27, 2017",Beautiful landscapes but animals were not visible,24,"Pensacola, Florida",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This park is excellent and I'm not sure if it is always uncrowded, but on a Saturday in mid-June, I would have expected more folks. Not that I was complaining to have trailheads to ourselves and no congestion the loop road. Saw lots and lots of bison, a few deer, a small herd of horses, and a pheasant. We were there from 9a to about 2p and did about four really short hikes and one 2-miler while driving the loop road. About the only improvement the park could make is to have a shuttle for folks that want to hike some of the semi-circle routes that start and end on the road.","June 25, 2017","Excellent, quiet park",119,"Louisville, Colorado",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I actually like this park and really admire Theodore Roosevelt's vision to preserve natural land in his time. However, after visiting Badland, Wind Cave, Arches, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Teton, and Yellowstone in an intensive road trip, I feel Theodore Roosevelt National Park does not have the WOW factors as compared with the rest on the list. By all means, it's a very nice park - well curated and preserved, but it just does not have the same magnitude as the other National Parks do. In my very humble opinion, it is more like in the level of a State Park. Regardless, I enjoyed my visit there. The hike is nice, and the view from Painted Canyon Visitor Center is nice. Maybe I will try to visit the north unit next time and see if it would change my opinion.","June 15, 2017","Good, but lack of WOW factor as compared with other National Parks",415,"Chicago, Illinois",4

Those are definitely on the list for a return visit. We've always ended up doing the loop in a clockwise direction... next time I want to go counter-clockwise since it seems like there are more overlooks and trails that we keep missing because we spent too much time looking at prairie dogs at the start.","June 14, 2017",Get Off the Beaten Path!,117,"Mandan, North Dakota",5

Loved the history around Teddy Roosevelt visiting the area after the tragic death of his mother and wife on same day; how the beautiful, stark country of ND saved and comforted him. Must admit it was difficult for me, a city girl, to understand why folks settled this part of the country, but came to deeply appreciate North Dakota's beauty, exemplified by the park, and the kindness of the people of North Dakota.

We stopped at the visitor center in the South Unit in Medora, ND, where you can view the cabin TR lived in during the 1880's. Most people don't know that Teddy was a real cowboy who ranched in North Dakota as he tried to overcome his intense grief over the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day, Valentine's Day 1884. This tiny cabin, which he shared with his two ranch partners, includes his writing desk, bed (covered with a buffalo robe), kitchen and rocking chair. It's a very interesting display.

Gorgeous day for the scenic drive along with a couple of small hikes to check out the vistas. At one point we were worried about missing seeing some buffalo but at the scenic overlooks we spotted a herd. Then while traveling along the road we spotted more and more - each one a tad closer until we came around a corner and there they were! Walking down the road with a smaller herd of about 10 with little ones in tow. What a treat. We stayed a respectful distance away and waited for them to cross over into a field before passing.

It was well worth the time. Our visit began with a stop at the Painted Canyon Visitor Center. We spent about 20 minutes in the visitor center watching a video about Theodore Roosevelt. It was very interesting. The center also has a spectacular viewing area of the badlands. It was a 10 minute drive to Medora, where the entrance to the South unit of the park is located. The ranger at the visitor center had provided a map with suggested stops along the 30 mile loop. We were rewarded with sightings of bison, prairie dogs, wild horses, and deer. One of the stops required a short and easy hike to a beautiful view of the little Missouri River. The loop took about 3 hours to complete with frequent stops along the way. We decided to skip the town of Medora, because it looked pretty touristy.

Also saw 1 badger that jad successfully caught a Prairie dog & was heading down its own hole.Our 3 oldest kids 11, 10, 7 years old did the Junior Ranger stuff lile we always do @ the National Parks.

The visitors center at the south unit was a great start containing displays on Roosevelt and an informative video on the park. There are also helpful park rangers to answer questions. A gift shop is also there. We headed out on the loop road in the south and it was not long before we encountered a clearing with about 50 bison grazing and mothering their young. The badlands scenery and green grassland is really spectacular and also views of the Little Missouri River. There are a number of hiking trails available with difficulties varied to meet anyone's needs. Road turnouts are marked to show special aspects of the park. As we continued along the road, we encountered another group of about 100 bison on both sides of the road and on the road. It took us about 20 minutes to get thru the area as the bison surrounded our car and were in no hurry to move on --- it was a fantastic experience for us! The next day we headed to the north unit. It is a bit of a drive to get to this part but it is well worth it and the badlands and grasslands were different than In the south. There are more vistas and view opportunities of the Little Missouri River. We saw about 10 bison total but what you see varies from day to day.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Most wildlife viewing happens in the wild either early in the morning or late in the day. First thing in the morning is always a crap-shoot on what we as humans think early is and what the wildlife think early is (think dawn or just before and you will be close). But, late in the day is easy - just be there about an hour before sunset and the wildlife will be out feeding for the night.The buffalo at TR NP are no different and are so accustomed to people that they don't really pay much attention to you - now that does not mean that you can crowd them, touch them or get physically close for pictures - keep your distance and remember you are visiting in their home and all is well.While setting up camp in the campground my truck suddenly lurched and I was surprised to find a buffalo using my front bumper to scratch some winter hair off his shoulder. Made for some nice pictures and I will probably name the small dent in his honor! TR NP was one of the nicest National Parks I've been to, it seems like a lot of people don't know about it or it is just not on their path, too bad for them!

South unit of the park has loop road with various trail heads and vantage points that afford great views of the varying landscape.North unit is a bit more remote, but not a terribly long drive from Medora. It is a bit different from the south unit and would really recommend spending a day (or part of a day) exploring. But make sure you have water and supplies you need - as there is not much by way of visitor amenities.","May 13, 2017","A ""must"" visit! WOW!!!!",58,"Albany, New York",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"If you want to see Bison up close, this is your stop. We went to the South Unit and did the 36 mile scenic loop drive. Right off the highway and took us about 2 hours (with stops) but if you don't plan on stopping it still takes about 1 and a half hours. Saw at least 20 Bison, 5 of them right along the road (one of them on the road) and horses and prairie dogs as well. Great stop for travelers through North Dakota.","May 10, 2017",Great Wildlife,12,,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This little known park is where TR turkey came of age and gained his appreciation for conservation. We turned into the south unit from 1-94, parked our RV and unhooked. Unless you are camping the ranger was very happy and supportive of us not taking our RV on the loop drive. We drove the loop drive and saw prairie dogs, bison and wild horses. The views were breadth taking. There are tons of hikes of all lengths. The campground is very nice, but I would probably not take a ""big rig"" in. Be sure and ask a ranger first. All told we spent about 4 hours and really saw a lot","May 4, 2017",Breathtaking,36,"Tucson, Arizona",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Hidden only by the shadows of more notable National Parks that are relatively nearby like Yellowstone, Glacier, and The Badlands - this park (we experienced the Southern half vs the Northern half) was delightful. During off season we were able to ease our way along admiring the thousands of prairie dogs, numerous bison, mule deer and wild horses. The scenery is very Badlands-esque. Very nice ""loop"" road with many scenic views. We thoroughly enjoyed The Visitor's Center exhibits and seeing the President Roosevelt's cabin that was relocated here as well. What a great American!This park receives nearly 3/4 million visitors per year so make it a point to stop in off season if possible. It is located just a few short minutes off of I-94.

But the main park visitor center was open and the park was not crowded. The Park Ranger was very helpful and gave excellent information on the Park and help with bird identification. The hiking trails are wonderful, saw lots of bison and even more wild horses. Would love to return in the summer when the grass is green, I am sure it would be even more wonderful!

The expansive views continued to impress us. We spotted at least 30 deer in the park, countless prairie dogs scurrying along the ground, an eagle, and a few bison. We visited on Thanksgiving day so the park was nearly empty. We only passed a few other cars. It was incredible to have the park nearly to ourselves while we enjoyed a picnic overlooking breathtaking views. It was one of my favorite Thanksgiving meals.","January 19, 2017",Vast Unsettled Wilderness with Abundant Wildlife - Simply Incredible,344,"Boynton Beach, Florida",5

Every minute, the colors would change, turning new shades of orange and red. The site was not very crowded and there were trails that were there to venture down into the canyons. Very free to roam wherever, but watch your footing, because the canyons are like sand and crumble in some places!Must do if you're in the area!!","January 4, 2017","Relaxing, Beautiful Sights.",13,New York,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"One of Teddy Roosevelt's friends told him that the area looked like ""hell after the fires went out."" That is part of the truth, for sure, but having been to many national parks, I can suggest that this park has a beauty all its own. There are so many interesting formations to wonder about, lots of trails for hiking from easy to well, you won't catch me on them, and we saw so many different kinds of animals in pretty close proximity (but nothing dangerous when we were there). To do both parts of the park--north and south--takes a full day even with only limited hiking. This is a pretty unpopulated part of the country, so if you are not camping, I suggest you have reservations somewhere close to the south end before you start and near the north end after you finish. Or vice versa. If you have only time to visit one of the two, the southern park, much larger than the norther one, should be your pick so you can see Roosevelt's cabin.","January 4, 2017",Unique and interesting,37,"Kalamazoo, Michigan",5

The weather was windy and there were thunderstorms in the area. Even so, we had plenty of sunshine to take in the natural beauty of the park. As the park's name suggests, this is somewhat a tribute to Theodore Roosevelt, the 'father' of the U.S. National Park system. Theodore Roosevelt had a ranch near the park and if you visit you can discover the history that is related to this former U.S. President.","December 11, 2016",A Remote Place of Beauty and History,19,"Brecksville, Ohio",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"In the month of October we visited Theodore Roosevelt National Park. For those that are only interested in seeing the wildlife i assure you that around the fall time is the best. The reason why is less people and tourist are out there during the colder months of North Dakota. So if you do not like the crowds or like the long lines then during this time is the best time. We took the vehicle tour and we loved every moment of it, from the millions of Prairie Dogs to the wild Buffalo's. We took our three year old, who was in awe during the time of seeing these beautiful creatures. In some area's you can get out of your vehicle and walk around in the designated area's and in those areas of course you will and can see the wildlife there. Also another perk for those with Military Service Members, all National Wildlife Parks allow members and family members in the Parks for free of charge. You will be given an card that can be used not only here in TRNP, but also in other National Parks. So to those families and Active Duty Service members here is something you can do with the family. Now the downside of visiting during the fall months. Most of the tourist area's to include the souvenir shops will be closed during these months. But a few shops are still open.","November 11, 2016",The Great Plains of North Dakota.,3,,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited in July along with many other people. Yet the park is so large that we did not feel crowded and the vistas were wide. The Badlands are really interesting and we saw the prairie dogs and a marmot. The herds of buffalo were amazing. One large male one came right up to the car and just stopped, as if he were waiting to be admired. Females and their calves were grazing along the road and he was on patrol. They are safe as long as one does not harass them and stays in their vehicle.It was also interesting to see the Maltese Cross Cabin where Teddy Roosevelt stayed part-time for several years. It has been restored now and is decorated in period furnishings.I recommend this for children, especially so they can get to see some of the buffalo.","October 28, 2016",Really enjoyed visiting this park.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We loved our visit to Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We started at the Painted Canyon's Visitor Center, right off the interstate. Here there is plenty of parking, bathroom, small gift shop, and a beautiful overlook. The gal working there wasn't very cheerful but maybe she was having a bad day. We then went to the South Unit's visitor center, which was right off a charming, little town with cute shops. This visitor center had plenty of parking, bathrooms, a theater which played a movie every half hour, a gift shop, a small museum, and one of Teddy's cabins, which you could enter for a self-guided tour. The gentleman here also wasn't too friendly, which is the only negative thing we encountered really. Most national parks I go to, the rangers are so informative and friendly. We then drove the whole south unit scenic byway, which was beautiful. We stopped at every overlook and took lots of pictures. We saw about ten cars the whole time, so very quiet compared to other parks. We saw prairie dogs, wild horses, lots of birds, and only one buffalo.Tons of trails with varying degree of length, too.

Lots of oil workers and the landscape is littered with tons of oil rigs. Also stayed in Dickinson about 30 miles from the southern unit. Like staying there better.

We hiked the Painted Canyon Trail and part of the Lower Paddock Trail in the South Unit of the Park and the Riverbend Overlook Trail in the North Unit. We camped in both places. The starry skies at night were amazing. A docile bison wandered through the campsite in the South Unit. We saw many, many bison (more in N. Unit), wild horses, deer, coyotes, countless prairie dogs, a rattlesnake and more. Mid-September the trees in the canyons were brilliant yellow and we were pleased with the warm temps.

But there are many places to stop and enjoy the views. Take photos. Read about the wildlife and history of the Park and surrounding areas. Also there are several trails you can try if you have the time, some of which provide expansive views of the Badlands of North Dakota.

Got out and walked part way on the Wind Canyon trail to see the river.That night we drove very slowly and carefully (so many deer) into the park to look at the stars, be sure to have a flashlight to avoid snakes and Prarie Dog holes.The next morning we looked the visitors center, saw the movie, and Theodores cabin.","October 7, 2016",Spectacular,10,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5

Starting at the South Visitors Center We took the loop road stopping periodically to admire the scenery. We took one of the easy trails a short distance to an overlook and it was worth the time. The area around the Little Missouri river was already in high fall color. There is abundant wildlife. We saw bison, a pack of wild horses, and numerous prairie dogs.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Who knew that there was an excellent National Park on the western side of North Dakota? The park has two sections (south & north). We visited both parts. It was off-season (late Sept) and the weather was spectacular (high 60's and sunny). This is the Badlands of North Dakota and looked similar to the Badlands of South Dakota. Beautiful vistas and views of the Little Missouri River. We walked a few of the trails. These walks are not for those with disabilities. One said that it was wheelchair accessible, but it was over a gravel path. At one point it became narrow & steep and there was no sign saying that the wheelchair accessible part had ended.We saw some animals (bison, deer, antelope, lots of prairie dogs). The Visitor Center had said that we could walk anywhere we wanted.We drove around the 36 mile loop and stopped along the way. Since there were no people around, it was easy to find parking at trail entrances.The entrance to the north section is over an hour from the south section. The south section is right off of I-94. The north section is 50+ miles north on a two lane road with absolutely nothing to see. Flat open landscape. No place to get gas or make a bathroom stop, so do that before heading up there. It has a 14-mile road (28 miles in & out). We did not walk any trails, but stopped at most of the viewpoints. Very pretty. Saw more bison and prairie dogs here. Short movie about Teddy Roosevelt in the Visitor Center in the south part of the park is worth seeing. One of his cabins has been moved behind the center and is interesting.If you like the Badlands of South Dakota, you'll enjoy Theodore Roosevelt National Park.","October 4, 2016",Worth a detour - similar to the Badlands of SD,69,New Jersey girl,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Didn't really know what to expect. The park is open 24 hr a day. There is a 36 mile looped road thru the park and takes about 1.5 hrs to drive. I started to drive the park about 5pm. So I had about 1.5hrs of sun light left. It was worth the time. I was by myself so I was trying to drive and look at the same time and was able to see a lot. When I saw something I stopped right on the road. Not much traffic at all. Saw lots of Buffalo. Saw 2 pheasants, Farrell horses, a coyote going after prairie dogs and a baby elk. Saw most at dusk. Staying in Medora overnight and planning on getting up at sunrise and drive the park again. Great way to end the evening and with a cup of hot tea and a drive thru the park and maybe a quick hike it will be the perfect way to start the day. There are campsites and hiking trails in the park also. If you have a chance come see the park.","September 30, 2016",nice,47,Minnesota,5

It is very quiet but also beautiful. There are multiple trails here of varying difficulty. We saw lots of bison. I have never seen cannonball concretions before and the view where the Little Missouri turns is amazing. This park is not epic like Yellowstone or Yosemite.

We camped with our teardrop camper at the Juniper Campground there -- the place was practically overrun with bison wandering throughout the camp sites. The scenery was breathtaking. We liked it so much that on our return trip west, we went a more southerly route so we could visit the South Unit of the park. There, one big bull bison hung around the various Cottonwood Campground sites continuously, it seemed. The Scenic Loop Drive was amazing -- incredible geologic vistas, hiking trails and view points as well as huge prairie dog towns and wild horses.

We left that road and traveled highway 21 south on what is called the Enchanted HIghway. There we saw 7 large structures manufactured from metal along the way. The gentleman who did these sculptures has a wonderful eye and sense of humor. There are geese, deer, fish, pheasants, people and Teddy riding a rearing horse. It was worth the drive. We then headed over to Amidon ND which took us on the scenic gravel road through the Little Missouri Grasslands and ND Badlands. It was well worth the extra time to go through these places. We arrived in Medora, which is almost a ghost town in late September, but that was okay since we were headed for the TRNP. It was a great 1-2 hour drive through the park with many beautiful vistas and trees and draws. We did see some bison along the road, and also a rattle snake that was in the grass, just off a hiking path......But the highlight of the trip for me was seeing one of the small bands of the wild mustangs that roam the park. I have been following this group on a web site called Wild in North Dakota, and when I actually got to see some of them in person, made my whole trip!!

There are plenty of observation points and vistas, miles of hiking and walking trails and even an RV park. You will be able to observe bison (American Buffalo), mule deer, elk, prairie dogs, and, our personal favorite, wild (feral) horses. There is something very special about seeing horses in a wild state. We saw a mule deer doe chasing a coyote (she probably had a fawn), and we've seen buffalo without the tons of cars blocking the roadway as in Yellowstone and others.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We went to this National park because it was the highest rated attraction in North Dakota according to Michelin travel guides. This place has badlands, canyons, interesting rock formations with unique erosion patters. It also has grand vistas, hiking, and a lovely, woody river running through it. Unfortunately we had just visited the magnificent Badlands National Park near Rapid City , SD and so this park rather paled in comparison. I still do not regret having gone though as it was different than the badlands in many ways and we experienced the largest concentration of cute Prairie Dogs imaginable.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"There are 3 units in Theodore Roosevelt National Park ‚Äì Painted Canyon, South and North Units. If you‚Äôve come this far you need to see all 3 because they are all different. The Painted Canyon visitor center is merely an overlook and rest area just off of I-94 Exit 32 and will take less 30 minutes, but the views are nice. The South Unit is near Medora ND. It has a nice loop drive where you get nice views of the Badlands, prairie dogs, bison and we saw a coyote. It is an easy half day visit with plenty of time to take a hike. The North Unit is located 1.25 hours from Medora but you shouldn‚Äôt miss it. Views of the Little Missouri River at the end of the road are spectacular as well as views of the prairie grasslands.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"T. Roosevelt N.P. has three tracts: north unit (near Watford City, ND), south unit (near Medora, ND), and the Elkhorn Ranch unit (northwest of Medora). The three units are quite different, although they are all strung out along the Little Missouri River. Of the three, the South unit has the best accommodations and restaurants nearby. I visited the South unit on a rainy day in early September. There is a great film at the Visitor Center, which gives insight into Teddy Roosevelt and why he came west after great personal loss. The restored Maltese Cross cabin (which he had built) is adjacent to the VC, and seemed quite simple for a man of great wealth and political connections. Departing from the VC, the Scenic Loop Drive took me into the badlands with stunning views over the Little Missouri River, lots of prairie dogs, groups of bison, and a few mule deer. I hiked the Ridgeline Nature Trail (about 1/2 mile), which had fabulous views over the convoluted badlands landscape. I found the Coal Vein trail (less than a mile long) most interesting, as numbered stops explained the landscape geology (both depositional environment, and how it came to look as is does today). There are lots of pull outs along the Scenic Loop Drive, and several trails intersect it, if you want to explore on foot. I ate lunch at the Boicourt Overlook, and watched rain showers hover over the multi-colored rock layers. The trail which starts from Roundup Horse Camp rambles along the river bottomlands, offering a close look at the river. Due to the rain, the trails were a bit slippery, especially those which crossed volcanic ash deposits, which turned as slick as ice. I was grateful for log steps placed in many of the trails. If you decide to hike, it is good to wear sturdy hiking boots or walking shoes. Teddy Roosevelt came west to heal his spirit; you can refresh your outlook on life in this place of rugged beauty.","September 20, 2016",A less-visited National Park with badlands vistas and abundant wildlife,496,"Marietta, Georgia",5

Along the scenic loop drive we hike several trails and saw great fields of Black-tailed Prairie Dogs, a few herd of bison and over a dozen wild horses.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This National Park was so unexpected. Had done our research but didn't expect to see what we saw. We went to the north entrance. It was a nice paved scenic drive to the top of the mountain. We did see 1 bison but it was a very hot afternoon, was glad to spot the one off in the distance. The rock formations were very impressive. They were out of Junior Ranger books but it was on the 4th of July weekend. If you are adventurous there are a number of trails for you to use. If not, the drive is very scenic with a number of overlooks with turnoffs.

Our last visit to the north unit was blessed with lots of bison and even big horn sheep. The vistas are gorgeous, the roads in good condition, it has a good number of pullouts but also be prepared for some wildlife jams. Definitely start your visit with Painted Canyon Visitor's Center and the Visitor's Center as you enter the park. It has a display about Theodore Roosevelt and his cabin.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I consider TR to be somewhat below average among United States national parks, due to small size, comparatively limited visitor services, and recreational opportunities that are interesting but not very diverse. To us it felt more like a national monument in scope, and would stack up well against almost any of the monuments. The South Unit is the largest and most accessible of the park's three units, easily reached from I-94; in fact, the highway runs right through the unit, with a somewhat negative impact on the ambiance and get-away-from-it-all feeling. The 35-mile loop drive through this unit gives a good overview of the scenery, with several prairie dog towns en route and opportunities to see larger wildlife. (A caveat: restrooms are few and far between on this loop. Make sure you're ""prepared"" for the loop before leaving the rather basic visitor center.) Trails range in length from quick, 15-minute walks, some of them wheelchair-accessible, to day-long, 10-mile outings into some wild country. However, they are also few in number, and the scenery is less varied than at most parks. All told, I certainly can recommend an afternoon's visit for the I-94 traveler, but it's not nearly on the scale of the grand national parks like Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Grand Teton, etc.","September 12, 2016",So-so by the standards of national parks; would be a great national monument,143,"Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States",3
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I've been touring the national parks this year and my expectations for TRNP were not very high. My expectations were exceeded. I explored the park's scenic drive and offshoots, but there are other sections of this park to explore if you want to make more than a day of it. This park is a badlands park, but is better than Badlands in South Dakota. It is more lush and has more wildlife. My favorite thing about the park is that it is one of the less popular national parks. The wildlife experiences you get here are more special than they are at places like Yellowstone because it is very often just you and nature. I came across bison and wild horses on trails by myself.

The park is divided into two sections, North and South, and we got to both in our 4 days. The North unit is smaller and less crowded. The South unit was definitely more crowded (it was Labor Day weekend) but we also saw more wildlife here and did a great hike to the Petrified Forest with buffalo grazing not far from the trail.

We were there on the anniversary weekend so we didn't have to pay the insane entry fee of fifteen dollars per motorcycle. The National Park fees have gotten out of hand and at fifteen dollars per person we probably would have skipped seeing this natural wonder and that would have been a shame. It was a very nice ride with lots to see. The visitors center is informative and has a lot of memorabilia as well. Much like the Badlands of South Dakota it has Prairie Dogs and Bison living on and roaming free on the land. It was well worth the price we paid.

Few facilities - only at the entrance station - just a loop drive and some walking trails. I guess better if you just want to drive and see, but after spending 3 days mountain biking and getting intimate with the terrain and landscape - a drive through seemed rather plain and boring - best to get out and ride or walk through to really get the feel for this unique landscape.

There are not enough places to eat in town, and the shops and restaurants close at 7:00 p.m. Definitely a tourist attraction for people who like a quaint style atmosphere. I think some of the hotels connected with the Foundation must be very expensive. The musical and pitchfork steak dinner in Medora were not open on Mondays.

We watched the film in the visitor center, talked with the rangers and then drove the loop road completely around the south park. We saw over 100 buffalo, over 50 mustangs and countless prairie dogs (darn, they're cute!) The landscape is varied, rugged and wild with the Little Missouri river running through the area.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My husband and I had no idea what we were going to see before we approached this park and when we reached the first lookout at the easternmost entrance overlooking the painted canyon, we were overwhelmed. We thought we were looking at the painted desert. Someone said ""Look, there are buffalo,"" and I had to squint to see several small dots in the landscape that I blew up in my 200mm lens to see. Sure enough, there was a herd of them. Unfortunately, we didn't come upon any in the park, but we did see plenty of wild horses and prairie dogs and unbelievable painted-rock scenery in the 38-mile loop we drove. We never tired of looking at the varied compositions of views of landscape at every turn and, of course, kept looking for those buffalo. It was a delightful afternoon and we would love to see it again on another trip. That day they were issuing a Theodore Roosevelt Quarter on the 100th anniversary of the National Parks. It's a park you don't want to miss.","August 27, 2016",Breathtaking Colors,34,"Middlebury, Vermont",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent a full day exploring the south unit of the park. The 38 mile auto loop takes you through wonderful scenery, with multiple prairie dog towns and wandering bison and wild horses. Although the overlooks are nice, as always it's best to get out and walk. A short walk to the top of Buck Hill offers spectacular views. The Coal Vein trail is less than a mile, but plunges you directly into the mounds and vegetation. The Petrified Forest was my favorite hike, but you have to drive outside the park on well graded dirt roads to get to the trail head. You can reach amazing areas of petrified tree stumps in about 1 mile of easy to moderate walking. One important note: unlike many other national parks, there are no toilets or drinking water along the loop road.

Be sure you have plenty of gas as its about 60 miles between N. and S. units. Take water and a picnic as there are no amenities in the park other than the campgrounds where there is water and toilets.

It would have been helpful if there were more trail-specific brochures/maps to tell you what you were seeing as you hike. Several of the trail head signs had slots for these, but they were always empty. I was disappointed to find that none of the visitor centers had passport books or 2016 Stamp Series sheets available.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Teddy Roosevelt NP is remote, but worth the trip. The North Dakota Badlands within the Park are more colorful and dramatic than the South Dakota Badlands. There is more green vegetation and wildlife here. Buffalo Herds are easy to spot and numerous short hikes lead to spectacular overlooks.- The drive to TRNP from any direction is spectacular. Definitely drive between The Black Hills and TRNP for some gorgeous country with a few attractions (tallest peak in ND, geographic center of the United States, Crow Buttes, and more).- There is a $20 fee per vehicle to enter, but the NPS waives the fee several days each year, so check ahead.- If you have only one day, drive the South Unit Loop Road and stop at some of the overlooks. Some require a short hike, but most are very easy. You'll drive right through several Prairie Dog Towns.- If you have a second day, take a longer hike. Visit the petrified forest!- Don't miss the desolation and beauty of the North Unit. It's an hour away and worth every minute of the beautiful drive through grasslands. The North Unit is basically a huge valley of the Little Missouri through more Badlands. Wildlife was more prevalent here that in the South Unit.- If you have an extra day, Drive even further North through New Town and back across the Garrison Dam for the best of what North Dakota has to offer. You will see an absurd number of oil wells and equipment, but they don't spoil all the beauty. Watch for Nuclear Missile Silos along the way!- This part of North Dakota is very desolate, so plan ahead. Fuel and food are available in Medora for a premium.- Camping is available inside the South Unit at the Cottonwood campground, but no reservations are accepted, so arrive early.

We visited the park in July and were surprised that it was so quiet and peaceful. We took a drive through the park starting early in the morning and saw several bison right up next to the road, wild horses, elk and plenty of prarie dogs and watch out for the rattlesnakes. We also took a horseback ride in early afternoon, which was absolutely wonderful. Don't forget to stop in and visit Theodore Roosevelt's Maltese Cabin.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Having just been to Yellowstone, we came here really just to experience the remoteness of this park. Because it was due to be raining the day after we arrived in Medora (making cycling impossible) we had to settle for the car-driven loop in the evening. It was brilliant, teeming with buffalo, deer and prairie dogs (and less happily a baby rattler, which made us wonder where its mother was...). The landscape changes back and forth from the most bucolic green meadows to pink and yellow badlands. Even though it was the peak tourist season and Fodor's recommended as their main must-do thing in the park, we were the only people on Buck Hill to witness the sunset. Beautiful - wish we'd had more time or better weather to walk or cycle the trails the next day.","August 21, 2016",Wonderful varied landscape and plentiful wildlife,52,London,5

The south part of the National Park is crowded even during the week in the summer but the north part of the park is not. We did both and enjoyed both loop drives.

The Theodore Roosevelt Visitor Center near Menora was convent for us as it featured a large, easily accessible parking lot to maneuver our motorhome. We decided to take the short walk to where a small crowd of spectators were and we were glad we did. What we saw was an enormous expanse of terrain that stretched for as far as the eye could see. It was a miniature version of the Grand Canyon. We took in the vista for much longer than we had allotted for our rest stop. The Visitor Center was stocked with the usual National Park souvenirs but it also had interesting displays and maps that told the story of why Teddy Roosevelt loved the area. You should definitely schedule this spot if you are in North Dakota.","August 15, 2016",Hidden Gem,4,"Souderton, Pennsylvania",5

The Badlands of North Dakota are beautiful and much different than the Badlands in South Dakota. We were so happy that we made the effort to see this beautiful park. I am so glad that Roosevelt thought ahead and helped to make this available to everyone.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We stayed in Medora, ND for 3 nights for the purpose of visiting Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We absolutely loved both the North and South Units and highly recommend going to both. If you are looking for a relaxing national park experience without tons of visitors, then this is definitely the place! We ran into, maybe, a dozen people over the course of our visit. Such a special place - it is also perfect if you enjoy wildlife photography! I try and visit all placed where bison roam free, so this was perfect for me. Highlights from the South Unit:Of course we drove the Scenic Drive. In fact, we drove it twice on our all-day visit. We completed short hikes along the way. - We hiked to the Old East Entrance Station that is no longer in use. This is a beautiful, flat, easy trail with a prairie dog town along the way. The landscape was beautiful, and I recommend for folks looking for something non-strenuous. - We hiked the Coal Vein Nature Trail. More up/down with steps. Very pretty. - We hiked the short Wind Canyon Trail. About half-way up, we realized that there was a perfect view of an enormous bison herd. I would say there were more than 200 bison. It was so lovely, we went back to the car to get our folding chairs and went back up the trail. We ate our lunch watching and listening to the herd. The grunting was easily enjoyed as it echoed through the canyon. - Lastly, we did the Ridgeline Trail. This has a very steep beginning. It was hot, and I was cranky. However, it was worth it. Once at the top, you walk along the ridge line. We saw a wild horse. - If you love prairie dog towns, then this is the national park for you! They are everywhere. Highlights from North Unit:We dedicated a full day here as well. We did not want to rush either unit. The Scenic Drive is shorter than the South unit - almost half. The landscape is different, more rugged. We drove to the end of the Scenic Drive and parked our car to hike to Sperati Point. - Sperati Point Trail: This is about 2.4 miles out/back. It is relatively flat and doable for people not in shape. You can see that you are sharing the trail with bison, although we did not see any. The views, wide landscape are beautiful, relaxing, and calming. Highly recommend. - Caprock Coulee: When you park your car, you realize that different trails begin at what is called Caprock Coulee. We did not do the Caprock Coulee Loop, so I cannot comment on it. We did the trail that takes you to the Prairie Dog Town via the Buckhorn Trail. This is a 2 mile trail. Again, it is relatively flat and easy. It is very ""open"" so I needed a lot of sunscreen. We loved it! The scenery was amazing. Highly recommend. There is a nice picnic area in the North Unit where we ate lunch. We then went to the Cannonball Concretions. Of course, everyone stops here. They were interesting to admire. I do strongly feel that both Units deserve a full day. We also spend a lot of time trying to take good pictures of bison. Please note that there are no bathroom facilities at any of the trail heads. This was a surprise for us - something to factor in. I know I will be back to this remote National Park some day!","August 14, 2016",Absolutely loved this National Park!!!,110,philadelphia,5

If you've never seen prairie dogs before, take a few minutes to watch. They are quite comical. One of the prairie dog towns has a set of benches for observing.

We camped in the Cottonwood Campground (south loop). Well shaded and the tent sites were right by the river. Nice and quiet camp ground with an interesting ranger talk about the bison. Took a five mile hike from Pleasant Valley ranch. Great way to see the scenery, but it starts (and ends) with a knee high wade through a calm river. Saw a rattle snake- that was exciting. Drove around the south loop in the morning- certainly worth an hour. Got pretty close to a bison and saw a heard in the distance. Also saw some wild horses and of course the prairie dogs.

If there was a downside, it was other travelers! Park direction is don't stop in the middle of the road! Can't tell you how many times we came upon cars stopped in the middle of the road with people in the car taking pictures. Geez - go to the pullout (there are many) and walk back to the picture site.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,The first day we visited the Visitor Center which was very informative -- take time to watch the movie. We then spent 3-4 hours driving the loop stopping to take many short walks and tons and tons of pictures -- no Buffalo seen however. The next day I rode my bicycle from town and did the loop --- it was one of the best cycling trips for scenery I have ever taken and I have biked across the US. I did see buffalo in fact a bull was coming right down the center of the road so I quickly got of the bike and waited on the side to take pictures etc. He could have cared less that I was there. The next day we did the North part of the park and saw a lot more buffalo and even saw sheep.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited this park during the peak of tourist season (July). The park's entrance borders on the town of Medora, ND. (Warning: limited accommodations!) After entering the park we were welcomed by a whole ""town"" of prairie dogs - yipping and running from mound to mound. Later we were stopped by a herd of buffalo (grunting, puffing, strolling) along the road. We also came upon a couple herds of wild horses as well. The views of the North Dakota Bad Lands and Little Missouri River were spectacular - with lots of pull offs and trails to hike along the 30'ish mile loop. The best part of the whole thing was the lack of traffic and hordes of people at this time of year (think Yosemite) and the ability to grasp the beauty of an unparalleled spot on our planet earth at our own pace, and with little distraction!","August 6, 2016",I Get Why Teddy Loved This Place!,10,California,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Great park. Spent the day pretending I was in a western film. We saw bison, eagles, wild horses from the car. Some great walking trails but too too hot on our day. Cost $20 for our car valid for 7 days. Go to the painted canyon overlook for free if you want to see bison and the badlands style of the park.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The park is made up of 3 units: Elkhorn Ranch, the North Unit, and the South Unit. We only visited the South Unit. Within the South Unit there are beautiful views from the top of the bluffs. We saw buffalo, wild horses, prairie dogs, and deer. There are many places to hike and camp/backpack through the park. We only had time to drive the approximate 35 mile scenic loop of the South Unit. The drive can be done as slowly or quickly as you want. There are many places to stop and take photos or to do some hikes. I would definitely visit again with more time to hike and visit the other units of the park. The entrance to the South Unit is right near the quaint town of Medora. Fedora is home to the Medora Musical, a few hotels, shops, and restaurants.","August 5, 2016",Mother Nature at her finest,6,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited the South Unit starting about an hour before sunset. We took many of the short hikes with great views. The 36 mile loop road was uncrowded at this time. We particularly enjoyed viewing bison, prairie dogs, antelope, rabbits, deer and wild horses. We climbed Buck Hill in time to watch the sun set and moon rise. For those of you looking for a great park with many fewer people than a place like Yellowstone this is the place to visit.","August 5, 2016",Uncrowded with spectacular views and much wildlife,20,"Greensboro, North Carolina",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"If you are in the area, this is a great spot to visit. There is a circular road through the entire park. Lots of spots to turn off and admire the views. The buffalo here are numerous throughout the park. In most spots you are able to pull off the road, and stay in the car while you admire these beautiful animals fairly close up. Be sure to carry water with you as there no spots outside of the visitor center when you first come in. The Visitor Center is small, but gives you an idea of the history behind the park. The Rangers there are very helpful.","August 5, 2016","Great spot to vist - beautiful scenery, lots of buffafol",25,"Frisco, Texas",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This park is absolutely wonderful. I had no idea and really had never given it much thought, but as I was planning a 10 day drive from Denver to SLC I wanted to head up to SD to see Mount Rushmore. As I was studying the map, I noticed this national park and thought ""why not just head on up and visit while we are in the area""---well sort of anyway. I just wish I had planned more days. The park entrance is right at the town of Medora which is also wonderful. There is a loop approximately 35 miles long that takes you through some beautiful countryside. We saw bison, praise dogs (hundreds of the little fellas), deer, wild horses, and more bison. We enjoyed the drive so much we did it again the morning we left. I would love to return. Our next stop was Yellowstone and really this was not that much out of our way. If you plan to be in the SD or eastern MT area,......go to Medora and visit this park. You will not be sorry.","August 3, 2016",Who Knew?,67,Kentucky,5

It is a good park to visit if you only have a few hours. And it'll have you wanting to return for more!There is a circuit that is an easy drive -- no frightening hair-pin turns with deep drop-offs.

However, we did still enjoy seeing lots of wildlife including prairie dogs, bison, and wild horses.","August 3, 2016",Prairie Dog Paradise,12,"Walla Walla, Washington",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Excellent park. We visited it twice in one day. Knowing we would have a day in Medora, I emailed the ranger (using the TRNP website) and said I was looking for a 5 mile hike or so, as well as recommendations at sunset. I couldn't have been more pleased. Early in the day we drove a gravel road to the Petrified Forest trailhead on the western edge of the park. We hiked both the North and the South trail--just far enough to be in the midst of the splendid petrified forest. Breathtaking. We saw wild horses and buffalo, including a big old one that we had to vacate the trail to let him pass. We returned to Medora and spent our afternoon there and had dinner. After dinner we returned to the park an hour or two before sunset. Again, I used the ranger recommendation. We took the loop road (headed east), and stopped at the recommended short hikes. Again, lots of wildlife--prairie dogs, wild horses, and buffalo. The Boicourt overlook is fabulous. Get out and hike to the edge, or tipoff of the trail. The view is incredible, especially in the warm light of sunset. Get back on the road before sunddown because you will not want to miss sunset at Wind Canyon trail. Don't go down into the canyon, but follow the trail along the ridge. The sunset over the cliffs and reflecting on the Little Missouri are incredible. The fact that there were three professional photographers there at the same time only convinced me more that this was the place to be. ","August 3, 2016",Excellent park. Ask for Ranger advice.,38,"North Branch, Minnesota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is not a well known national park. When I told my friends I was going there, most had not heard of it. It is a magnificent place to visit, one which makes you understand why Roosevelt went to this area to escape a personal tragedy and a political setback. There are lots of lovely hikes (with very few hikers) and plenty of Bisons roam. Prairie Dogs are around to, plenty of them. Don't miss the view from Painted Canyon Visitor Center in the hour leading to sunset. ","August 3, 2016",A fitting tribute to a great president,24,"Los Angeles, California",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is our third time here, and it is still America's best kept secret. If you visit in the hot summer months, hike early. The southern unit offers a variety of trails, from miles to less than a mile, rugged to easy. Drive the loop road to get a feel for the park and decide what trails you want to do. More than likely you will encounter bison on the roads. We encountered two males fighting on the road. Stay in your car and wait for the bison to pass. Because it was July and August during our visit, we saw many baby bison. Looking for a really quiet experience? Drive the hour up to the northern unit where you can enjoy interconnecting trails that take you deep into the grasslands and the beautiful rock formations. The overlooks are breathtaking. Bison also roam this park. Watch the short video in the small visitor's center. Both parks are open 24 hours, so go back in at night to watch the setting sun light up the rocks, then wait for the stars to come out.","August 2, 2016",Best kept secret,359,"Chicago, Illinois",5

The prairie dogs are hilarious and will entertain even little kids with their cuteAntics if you watch for a few minutes.Rattlesnakes are wild too and you might run into one in the park on the trails. you can also find some great humor watching insane people get out of their cars trying to take ""closer"" pictures of buffalo right next to large signs saying do not approach buffalo.Over all a wonderful experience!","August 1, 2016",So fun and so much wildlife ,26,"Terrell, Texas",5

We stopped first at the painted canyon visitor center and the view from their was amazing. You could see a rainbow of colors striping the landscape. It was gorgeous. Even the kids were amazed. In that visitor center we picked up the junior ranger program books. If you are not familiar with that program it is a booklet that has age appropriate activities to help guide your child in understanding why the park is important. At the end they get a free junior park ranger badge which they can keep. It is really fun and gives them something to do when they get bored of looking at landscapes so mom and dad can enjoy the views. However, they did not get bored. We would turn a corner and would discover something new to see. It was very cool. We saw pronghorn, prairie dogs, lots of wild horses, bison, and lots of birds. We heard several rattlesnakes on a trail we went on so that was a bit scary but we didn't actually see any of them. We were on the Ridgeline trail and it was much harder walking then I expected. My younger kids had to scoot down some places on their bottoms because it was so steep. It was a beautiful view we were told it would be a good one for kids and I don't think it was. It was only .6 miles and it took us hour. But it was still awesome. I want to go back and do the horseback riding when the kids are older.","July 30, 2016",So Many ANIMALS!!!

We saw many people getting too close to take pictures! The view from the visitor center overlooking the park was beautiful! We took the drive through the park and were very impressed, we saw several bison, LOTS Of beaufiul wild horses, and good views.

The stars of the park, other than the scenery, are the many prairie dogs! They are definitely up close. I recommend the loop road and any of the short hikes off of the loop but we also really liked the longer 2-3 hour hikes. Bring sunscreen, water and BUG SPRAY.

In the South unit we viewed a few bison, tons of prairie dogs, and wild horses in several locations. In the North Unit we got up close and personal with a herd of bison. It was amazing. We did a little bit of hiking in both parks and visited the visitor center in both parks. We spent about 4 hours in each park.

Took a (somewhat strenuous) 1 mile hike on the marked loop trail. Just wonderful to smell the cedar and the sage and look at the sculpted buttes in the evening light. Even if you just pull off for a potty break and a quick selfie, you shouldn't miss this free opportunity to marvel at the vistas that inspired old TR to advocate to preserve so much of our beautiful western lands for future generations.

Access to the Visitor Center and the ""South Unit"" is in the Historic town of Medora. Actually, Medora has a lot to offer with many historical venues, the popular Medora Musical/Pitchfork Dinner, shops & lots of activities for children. We found many of the hiking trails to be ""Easy to Moderate"". We were amazed by the scenic beauty of the park which can best be described as ""Badlands"". The most impressive time to enjoy the beauty of the park is at dusk or dawn. The colors of the various layers of rock & soil are best at this time. There is also a splendid loop drive through the park that takes you to a variety of elevations and vegetation. There are many scenic overlooks, pulloffs & trail options along the loop drive. Plan on a couple of hours to complete the drive or longer if you want to park and checkout some of the trails. There are also many places to access the small river that flows through the park.Wildlife viewing is another fun activity. Wild Bison (buffalo), Pocket Gopher towns, Wild Horses, etc are all found within the park. We observed a group of Bison using the bridge ahead of us on the road instead of the more difficult crossing of a deep gully. We also observed a Coyote wandering through a Pocket Gopher town hoping to snatch up an unsuspecting gopher!If you are traveling on I-94 and don't have time to take in the Park, you can stop at the ""Rest Stop"" along I-94.

Elk, bison herds, coyotes, mule deer, pronghorn and of course, prairie dogs! The sun was going down while on the Wind Canyon along the Missouri River. So many places to explore--best to spend time, but if you only have a short stay....travel in the evening, hike a bit, take in the colors.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I drove up to Theodore Roosevelt National Park from Spearfish, SD last week. It was $20 to enter the park. The pass was good for 7 days. Scenic Loop Drive is a 36-mile road that loops around the center of the South Unit. It's great because you can go at your own pace and style. You could remain in your car the entire time and enjoy much of what the park has to offer, but there's also many areas to get out and explore. Each trail head on the loop has a small parking area (some areas are wheelchair accessible as well). I did a few of these short hikes, but there's longer trails that bisect the loop and beyond too. Buck Hill gives you an elevated view of the badlands, but the views were best from Boicourt and Wind Canyon. Wildlife is most active around dawn and dusk. I was there for several hours around dusk and saw three buffalo herd, several coyotes, hundreds of prairie dogs, and many birds. Didn't notice any wild horses. The entire time I was there I encountered maybe 20 other cars on the loop. The North Unit is a 70-mile drive from the South Unit. I didn't trek up there mainly because of time, but visitors may also want to consider that there's a LOT of tractor-trailer trucks driving back and forth from the Bakken oil fields on this road. I drove up state road 85 from the border to get to the South Unit. There was construction in a few spots where alternating sides of the road were temporarily blocked so the other could pass through. If there's similar construction further north on 85, this could affect how quickly you could make the drive. Overall, I'd say the landscape here definitely is not as awe inspiring as those in Yosemite or Yellowstone, but the badlands are impressive, and you can enjoy the park's wildlife in peace without having to battle crowds of humans.","July 19, 2016","Lots of wildlife, few humans",16,"Denver, Colorado",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a beautiful area and the wildlife is fun to see. We saw wild horses, seriously wild horses running around through the park. Prairie dogs galore.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Ok so I have to admit that I now live 14 miles from the North entrance of Theodore Roosevelt National Park so I really should visit more than I do. I love hiking the trails all throughout the park. If you take some trails you will definitely see sites that you can not see from the road. Be causious of rattle snakes and always carry plenty of water. While on the trails also be aware that you may encounter wildlife around any corner. The buffalo are abundant and can be seen all year long. I love the wild horses at the south entrace. There is so much more to TRNP than I can cover but it is a sight to be seen at both entrances. ,"July 17, 2016",Take the trails,55,"Watford City, North Dakota",5

We did the entire loop in the car and pulled over to see some Prarie Dog Towns, Bison, and Ferrell Horses. The rolling hills are stunning.","July 17, 2016","Small, But Beautiful",56,"Waterbury, Vermont",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a small park, compared to Glacier and Yellowstone. We only went into the south unit and drove around the single road loop (36 miles). It took us about 1.5 hours. We arrived late in the day, so we did not hike. If I had more time I would like to hike a trail or two. The park reminds me of a smaller, more colorful, and more intimate version of the Badlands. It has a cozy and peaceful feel. I did not see any facilities in the the park. Saw lots of prairie dogs and 3 bison.","July 16, 2016",Peaceful and Beautiful,75,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Been to many National Parks, and have also visited the Badlands of South Dakota, so I wasn't expecting this area to match up, but this park exceeded everyone in the family's modest expectations. Only visited the South Unit, but access was easy (right from Main St. in Medora), the park was well laid out, and the trails were all well marked. The scenic loop had incredible scenery and something for everyone (short and long trails, easy to strenuous inclines, etc.). Even the painted Canyon scenic rest area 5 miles east of Medora had a great little 1-mile loop where you would be surprised that I-94 is right above you.There were not a lot of facilities in the South Unit outside of the visitor centre and the campground (could have used one more washroom in the loop) but the scenery and the trails more than made up for this.Best part of this park: middle of summer vacation, beautiful August weather (not too hot and not raining), and for most of the day we felt like we had the park to ourselves. If anyone has been to Yellowstone and found it overcrowded, and incredibly frustrating, you may want to check this place out. To me nature is much more enjoyable without lineups, traffic jams and 10,000 other tourists breathing down my neck at every turn. TRNP was a fantastic experience in this respect. We loved it!","July 16, 2016",Exceeded Expectations,1,"Winnipeg, Canada",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We stopped at this park on the way to Glacier National Park and were pleasantly surprised by the abundant wildlife here. We were almost immediately greeted by a huge bison herd, and encountered at least two more herds rich on the park loop road, in addition to ample prairie dogs, and a coyote. Saw much more wildlife here than at Glacier or in the Canadian Rockies. Is similar to the Badlands in South Dakota, but much more vegetation and wildlife. Town of Medora looked cute and Westerny, but we didn't have time to stop.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We stayed closer to the North Unit in Watford City. The North Unit is a 14 mile scenic loop. We drove this around 9pm and saw many bison (probably 75-100), and a few mule deer. At one point 2 bison were running down the middle of the road and we were on a motorcycle! They snorted and just ran on by us. The next day we drove down to Medora (very cute western touristy town) and the South Unit and drove through mid-afternoon. We did not see a single bison but did see the wild horses and the largest prairie dog colonies!! We walked around the Coal Vein Trail which is off the main road probably about a mile on a dirt road. The landscape is similar in the North and South Unit. The South Unit is larger (36 miles), I felt like I was ""in it"" versus just driving through and it has more trees. There is a nice 17 minute orientation movie with some voice recording of Theodore Roosevelt at the South Unit Entrance Visitor Center. Nice panoramic views at the Painted Canyon Visitor Center. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't feel like I missed out if I just saw one of either the North or South Unit.

Definitely go hike if you can but remember that the hikes offer no shade so wear a hat, put on sunscreen, and take plenty of water. The short walk up to the Wind Canyon Overlook is a good choice for those who don't or can't do longer hikes. It's a great place to watch the sun go down. We even got a small rainbow the evening we were there.","July 8, 2016",Fantastic Park,25,"Gnaw Bone, Indiana",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Teddy Roosevelt had a connection to this area before his presidency. He spent time and hunted here, and this helped lead to the creation of the National Parks. The park that would become his namesake would not be dedicated for years to come, however. It has the distinction of being one of the least visited parks due to the location. On I94, near the North Dakota/Montana border, it's in a remote location. Also, because of the location, winter weather can play havoc with road closings.We got to enjoy the park in May of 2016. The weather was nice, though windy; and we spent some time driving the loop of the South Unit. We did not have time for any of the trails, but got to enjoy a lot of breathtaking scenery, and saw quite a bit of wildlife - from the numerous prairie dog towns to wild horses and bison. We weren't sure what to expect from the park - and we were really pleased with our decision to detour from our trip to see it!","July 6, 2016",It's a shame this is America's least visited park,16,,5

The prairie dogs are fun to watch skitter around communicating and working. We also got to see about 6 feral horses climb a steep butte. I wish we had allowed more time to do some of the little hikes of 1-3 miles. In the upper NW corner of the park there is a petrified forest we didn't get to check out that requires a brief walk in.

We also saw the Maltese Cross Cabin and plenty of wildlife. After that we went over to Painted Canyon and hiked the loop trail down to the bottom and back. Great hike down, but steep coming up.

It worked out ok and didn't find any uninvited pests. After setting up camp I had enough time to make the 35 mile scenic drive around the South Park. This NP has two areas, north and south and there is some distance between the two. I left after one night although I had reservations for two nights as the daytime temperatures were in the mid nineties (F).

You will see thousands of prairie dogs and also buffalo but they are harder to spot and will probably be singles or small groups. We saw more buffalo in the North Section.

After this, you continue down I-94 to Medora, at which the entrance of the Park is located. The highlight of the South Unit is the 30 mile scenic loop drive. This scenic loop will afford you many great views and chances to see wildlife, including bison. On the 36 mile scenic loop the Boicourt Overlook Trail is a 15 minute walk along a ridge of a small mountain. It takes about 15-30 minutes and is 0.2 mi / 0.3 km in length. It is one of the most beautiful South Unit overlooks is accessible by this easy nature trail with slight grade. This overlook is a ranger favorite for sunsets over the badlands. Don't miss this stop.There are also several prairie dog villages and you can hear the dogs chirping.","June 19, 2016",North Dakota Badlands at Theodore Rooselvelt National Park-South Unit,727,"Loveland, Colorado",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,We have traveled all over the world but until this visit had visited every state but North Dakota. This park is probably the only attraction in the state worth going out of your way for. It is truly spectacular. We only did the southern loop but it was truly awesome.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"After 2 visits, we decided that this place is one of our favorite National Parks. You can‚Äôt beat the scenery, wildlife and seclusion. This is so much different than the more popular South Dakota Badlands. There is a 36 mile Scenic Loop Drive that weaves around the park that gives you many opportunities to stop and see the sights. You are guaranteed to see at the very least, bison and prairie dogs as you slowly meander through the park. Keep your eyes open for the feral horses! There are also many trails to hike, short and long to choose from. In the springtime, the trails will be muddy as we found out. Be careful hiking on trails that have brush next to them, you may even come across a rattlesnake, which we did while hiking the Coal Vein Trail. Luckily he gave out a warning rattle as my wife walked up to within 6 inches of where he was hiding. She was smart enough to stop and slowly back away. The small town of Medora just adds to the ‚Äúold west‚Äù feel you‚Äôll get if you visit here. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!","June 16, 2016",North Dakota Badlands!,49,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,I went to the park just because I had never been to the badlands. I honestly expected the park to be small and for everything to look the same. Nice visitor center; helpful Rangers; and the view was extremely varied and beautiful. On the north side of the park road loop just east of the river are some petrified trees. This was not shown on the park map. ,"June 15, 2016",It surprised me!,8,Kansas,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Started at the South Unit in the late afternoon. Glad we had stopped at the visitor center to get a bit of history and information on the formations. Much wildlife. We were told to allow an hour and half for the loop - not enough time, we spent over 3 hours with so many overlooks and short spur trails. The next day we headed to the North Unit. More dramatic. If you are just driving, it is not a loop drive like the south unit so you drive in and drive out the same direction. We did a nice trail near the campground that was paved and just about anyone could do. Get out of the car if you can and look at the pull outs.

Then the drive through the park. There are 3 different trails we toke the 2 hour one. It is a drive through with many places to stop along the way to explore. they have trails for hiking.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is a must-see national park.The park consists basically of a 30 mile loop road through the badlands of North Dakota. The scenery is spectacular. You take a leisurely 25 MPH drive along the road, taking in one jaw-dropping vista after another. You go from the river valley of the Little Missouri River to the tops of spectacular cliffs. Occasionally you'll want to stop to follow a short hiking trail to see what can't be seen from your vehicle.But the stars of the show are the animals. I'd never seen a prairie dog town before. Well, now I have -- hundreds of the cutie little critters playing, watching on their hind feet, scurrying here and there. I've seen a bison or two, but never a whole herd of them. We ran across two different herds, each with 20 or 30 animals each. One group was loafing in the shade of some rocks (it was a very hot day). Another was grazing through a meadow. We also saw several lone bulls. And we saw a herd of wild horses who were all standing on top of a long rock outcropping, almost as if to say, ""Here we are. Wanna take our picture?""It was late spring, so every species had young ones -- prairie dog pups tumbling around playing with each other, bison calves moving along with the herd, and foals peeking out from under mom's belly. It was just delightful seeing all that wildlife against such spectacular scenery.This is such an easy park to do with a family. Pile everyone into a car and drive through, stopping as often as you like. The neat thing is that the animals are right there. Prairie dogs chattered at us from the side of the road. One bull bison was grazing right on the verge. Of course we didn't get out of the car (bisons can be dangerous) -- but my wife rolled down the window and got some very up-close-and-personal photos of the beast.The visitor's center is helpful. A brief movie gives you the history and connection between the Park and our 26th president.I gather the Theodore Rosevelt National Park isn't one that people often think of (like Yellowstone, Yosemite, Glacier, or Everglades) -- but they should.","June 9, 2016","prairie animals, up close and personal, plus spectacular scenery and history",87,"Berea, Kentucky",5

I guess I wasn't expecting much since this park isn't very well known, but I was pleasantly surprised on how beautiful it actually was. We visited both the north and south units on a 95 degree day. We enjoyed the south unit much more than the north unit because of the different animals that we got to see. I had never seen wild horses until I came here. The views of the badlands were beautiful, and I absolutely loved the numerous short trails that the park had to offer. The scenic loop drive was also perfect since it was so incredibly hot outside. There were only a handful of other cars in the park, so our visit was at our own pace and we never felt rushed as we were driving. I definitely recommend a visit to this national park!

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We had only one day, so opted to travel just the south loop road. We arrived at the gate right at 8 a.m. and headed up the road and were treated to gorgeous views of the badlands of North Dakota, plus loads of bison, wild horses, and other animals. The loop road runs about thirty four miles and we were out of site of other cars and trucks for more than 3/4 of it. We were able to stop, back up, get out the car and stand on the seat to take pictures without any traffic coming either direction. Since it was early June, we were able to see colts with momma horse and calves with momma buffalo, plus all the rest. We plan to come back some time and stay longer, but one can get a great experience in just one day, if that is all you have. This park differs from the Badlands National Park in that there is more wildlife and the road runs much closer to the geological formations. The park feels more intimate as it is much smaller. We bookended our trip with these two parks, so I'd recommend both, but this lesser known one is well worth the trip as a stand alone.","June 8, 2016",Lonely Loop Road,153,"Moses Lake, Washington",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent about half a day driving through the southern unit of the park. Our first stop was the visitor center along I-94. We talked with the park personnel about where to stop and take some short hikes. They recommended we drive up to Buck Hill which is the highest point in the park and we took the walk to the top for a nice view. Next we stopped at Wind Canyon Trail and took about a quarter mile hike to the overlook above the river which was beautiful. We saw a herd of about 100 bison grazing in the valley. There are several points in the loop drive where you see prairie dog towns. The highlight of the drive was a bison that was walking right down the middle of the road and backed up the traffic. He finally moved over and I got a picture from the car window from about 20 feet away. Our final stop was the 2nd visitor center where we walked through Teddy Roosevelt's cabin.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited both the north and south units of the park. The north unit was virtually empty when we were there; we enjoyed walking the short paths to interesting features and rarely saw anyone. The visitor center staff is friendly. There are some interesting artifacts from his life - be sure to check out the life-size wooden horse and TR statue with TRs clothes on it - very cool! Roosevelt's Maltese Cross Ranch cabin is just behind it. You can walk into it and take a peek through glass at some historic furniture and artifacts (a couple of pieces were TRs; much of it is from the period but not necessarily his). Walking through the doors he used and seeing his living space was fascinating to two history buffs (""TR stood right here!""). Bison and prairie dogs abound. We took a short walk up a steep hill to a windswept ridge with a great view of the badlands. With the weather front coming from the west, sustained winds were over 50 mph at times - it was like flying with your feet on the ground, views included.If you are interested in geology and badland stratigraphy or getting a glimpse into the head of one of our greatest presidents, this park is definitely worth a visit.","June 4, 2016",Scenic geology,72,"Kalispell, Montana",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"As national parks go (at least out west), this park is relatively small and out of the way (have to fly into Bismarck, ND and drive 150 miles west and there's not much else to see in the area).The park is split into a North and South unit. The South unit is better developed and has more accessible trails. However, the North unit is visually more stunning with much more rugged hikes. The South unit also seems to have more wild life (it's easy to see prairie dogs and bison).We did three hikes in the North unit, the most demanding of which was the Caprock Coulee trail. It's a good hike - about 4.4 miles in a loop with about 600 feet elevation gain. If you do this hike, definitely do it counter clockwise starting with the nature trail! The last 1/2 mile is a killer even coming down and would be almost impossible going up.Unfortunately, the North unit is 52 miles from I-94 whereas the South unit is just off the highway.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt NP surprised me a lot. It is not one of the iconic parks on everyone's list to visit yet it had much to offer. Consisting of lots of grasslands, the park's beauty is a little more subtle. One of the highlights of the park is the easy sighting of animals. Just inside the park, right off the bat, we saw mule deer - bison and prairie dogs were close behind. We started out in the south unit. The park is divided into 2 main units, the south and the north. They are not connected and there is an hour drive between the two. There are trails ranging from .2 miles to 19 miles. The south unit has a 37 mile loop road and the north is an in and out road. NOTE - there are no bathrooms in the park except at the visitor center and a campground. We did all of the ""easy"" trails and 2 or 3 of the moderate trails. All were interesting, overlooking windsculpted geologic features and the LIttle Missouri River. There were lots of colorful wildflowers.We were advised by the rangers to go to a prairie town at dawn or dusk to see elk.Up at dawn, we went to one of the sites traipsing around until we found fresh elk poop.I could smell the elk but couldnt see any. We followed a trampled grass trail for a way but to no avail. We did see a coyote tho and later a pronghorn, wild horses, rabbits and a raccoon. We had no better luck at dusk later in seeing elk.The bison are strange animals. They would amble onto the road and just stand around blocking cars for a while and then slowly amble off the road. We saw several calves. There was much birdsong. We saw lots of lark sparrow, meadowlarks, towhees, sharp tailed grouse, magpie and mountain bluebirds to name a few.The last full week in May, when we were there, we nearly had the park to ourselves.It was wonderful. There are drawbacks to going there before Memorial Day tho. There are no ranger programs, and the brochures at the trailheads had not been resupplied. Also the town of Medora does not wake up until June either with only 2 restaurants open for dinner. But I think the good outweighs the bad.It is nice to take a drive down one of the gravel roads to experience the National Grasslands to the south of the park - short grasses as far as the eye can see.It is a very nice park whichever way you chose to enjoy it, whether just driving the road and stopping at overlooks (and bison!) or getting out and hiking the grasslands and seeing the formations up close.","May 30, 2016",Bison all over the place!,149,"Dayton, Ohio",4

It all depends on the weather. In the sunmertime the mornings and late afternoons are better for seeing bison, elk, pronghorn, mule and whitetail deer as it's cooler. Driving the loop in the middle of the day in July when it's 90*F will usually yield little results so plan accordingly! The prairie dogs should be out no matter the weather.

Many miles of trails run through the park as well.We took a spin through the campground and it looks well laid out, but campers should be aware that bison spend time in there as well.The trails we hiked were marked but not developed, so be prepared to work through rough terrain.Comparing this park to Badlands National Park in South Dakota, I'd say the following:1. Overall, TRNP is a little less challenging than the SD Badlands for back country hiking, but you will get a workout.2. SD Badlands has more striking vistas and more geologic variety, but fewer fossils.3. TRNP is less developed overall, and the entrance fee is lower as well.4. TRNP campground has lots of trees.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The good:It's you alone with nature. I didn't see one person on the two longer hikes I did, and saw just one person total on the 3 shorter hikes (caveat: This was april, but i'm certain that TR doesn't get really crowded.Great park for those who want to see wildlife, especially Bison, Prairie Dogs and Wild Horses.Great park for those who want to do some short hikes for decent exercise to good viewsMake sure to go to the North Unit - the prairie dog town near the Caprock Coulee trailhead is super cool and perfect for kids.Super convenient to Medora -- about a 5 minute drive into the park.The Not So Good: I had a lot of trouble with the Post-to-post hiking -- there were times where I couldn't find the trail. This was more of an issue on the Upper Paddock hike which was a very open space. I wanted to try Lone Tree Loop but couldn't find the post across the river crossing. If you want to do this one, ask the ranger for guidance.Also, there's many animal trails (cut by Bison and Horses) which made staying on trail a little tricky.Park fee is $20 - which is fine for a 2-day visit, but a little pricey if you are just popping in for the ring road.Recommendations:Go to the visitor center in Medora. Great exhibits on Theodore Roosevelt and the film was excellent. Worth 30 minutes for a pop in.Heed the warnings, DO NOT mess with the Bison. They are enormous animals (bigger than the car I was driving). If you don't want to do a lot of hiking - drive the ring road and do some of the smaller hikes and nature trails. You will definitely see Bison on the ring road (and prairie dogs if the sun is out). I also saw pronghorn deer, wild horse, a turkey, and a jackal.Ridgeline and Wind Canyon were the best. Head toward Boicourt Overlook around late afternoon for fantastic views in the dying light from road or the overlook itself. I did the Upper Paddock trail as well which was fine but ...If you want to do some hiking, head to the the North Unit. Caprock Coulee is a great moderate hike about 4.5 miles round trip - a decent ascent to a wonderful walk along the top of a butte. TIP: The start of the trail down is not well marked. Cross the parking lot at the Overlook and walk inside the fence along the road -- you'll see a post eventually. After finishing Caprock hike out to the Prairie Dog town (1.5 miles). It's not well marked (see not-so-good list below) and there are a lot of paths. From the trailhead you'll wind your way left, then get to a marker directing you to the Prarie Dog Town or Buckhorn trail. Go left and just stick tot he trail. You'll go down into a small wash and come out and the Prairie Dog Town is about 200 yards up. It is very cool. Try to sit 30 minutes and just watch and listen to them do their thing.Feel free to ping me if you want more details.","April 18, 2016","Undiscovered jewel, great for wildlife viewing",36,"Atlanta, Georgia",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This was our first visit to the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. We actually drove the loop three times. The first time was in the morning. The second time was around noon and we drove the opposite direction from the first drive, and the third time was at dusk. Each trip around was different. It is worth driving the loop at least twice if you have time, from opposite directions. The scenery/landscape looks different from each direction. At sunset, the shadows on the buttes are beautiful. We saw bison, Feral horses, Mule Deer, White Tailed Deer, Cayote, Prairie Dogs, Elk, and Pronghorn Antelope. The only negative thing I can say is that since it was off-season, there were no restrooms open in the entire park. That was difficult! Beautiful park!","April 14, 2016",Beautiful Park...Lots of Wildlife,8,"Niceville, Florida",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt was the president an inspired the creation of the National Park Service. This one named after him, is 70,000 acres of rugged Badlands of the North, South, and Elkhorn Ranch units. These Badlands of buttes and canyons were formed by wind and the Little Missouri River. While in the park I saw elk, antelope, bison, and wild horses. The horses touched me the most.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We love the national parks (this was our 36th!) and this one did not disappoint. We were there late march so not very crowded. The rangers at both parks - north and south - were very helpful with hikes. We spent all day (7:30 - 5:30) at the south unit and 6 hours at the north unit. Bison roaming free on the road is a thrill along with seeing wild horses and prairie dogs. If possible, give yourself at least 2 fulls days to see both sections as the drive from north to south take about 1:30 drive time. The north section is very small and the last 6 miles of the 12 mile out and back road is closed due to some rock issues.","April 1, 2016",A Well Laid Out Park!,467,"Winchester, Virginia",5

The famous badlands I've done a fair bit of traveling and don't get impressed by much anymore but I had to sit down and look out for a good while admiring and taking it all in.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Found this park by accident --- looking for an excuse to visit North Dakota on a 4,500 mile cross country road trip. I really enjoyed this park. It's divided into two sections -- a northern and southern. Both deserve a day. If you're a camper, the north zone had some pretty nice spots by a creek. If you're the hotel type, the southern zone is next to a very quaint town called Medora. We stayed at the Rough Rider Inn in Medora and I have reviewed that in a separate Trip Adviser review.Perhaps the highlight of our trip to Theodore Roosevelt National Park was going to the camp ground in the southern zone and attending the park rangers' astronomy outing. Using his laser, he pointed out the different planets, stars and constellations. Amazing if you're from a part of the country with extensive light pollution (perhaps 90% of the U.S.).During the day, we saw a lot of wildlife up close: prairie dogs, coyotes, wild mustangs, goats and of course bison. I thought going to North Dakota would be a one trip deal for me, but having visited Theodore Roosevelt National Park, I definitely am going back -- with a camper this time!!","January 19, 2016","Great park!

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This park had it all - good hikes, amazing views, and wildlife. We visited both sections and saw different things in both. The best bison viewing was in the southern unit, where the bison herds were adjacent to and on the main road of the park shortly after the visitor center. Most of the hikes are very short and perfect for young kids. We had a great time with the Junior Ranger program here too. The North Unit was more remote with no visitor center (bathrooms available in the campgrounds). We saw lots of prairie dogs here as well as a lot of songbirds on a numbered nature trail near the Little Missouri River. If you are short on time, visit the South Unit and skip the North Unit.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I was visiting family in Spearfish, SD and drove up one day to see the park. The drive to ND was bumpy and it rained the entire time. However, I was gifted with about 2-3 hours of no rain once we hit the park. I traveled the scenic route through the South Unit, including stops at the Painted Canyon and South Unit Visitor Centers. The wind was CRAZY and unlike anything I'd ever experienced. When we arrived at the Painted Canyon Visitor Center, they had been without power for hours. Luckily, just before we left it was restored because I didn't have any cash.The drive through the park was AMAZING! It was quiet and peaceful with other cars and people few and far between (unlike Yellowstone). The wildlife and landscape was just breathtaking. I see why Roosevelt fell in love with the area.I can't wait to visit the park again during a time when I can hike some trails, have more time to see the other two units, and spend a night or two in the park.","December 15, 2015",Breathtaking,19,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

If you're limited on time, the scenic drive is great; if you have more time, get out and walk on some trails. Visit in the morning to see the most wildlife -- though we saw a lot of bison on a recent afternoon drive.

Painted Canyon overlook is free, and, if you don‚Äôt have time, serves as a one stop microcosm of the park, but it is also an inviting teaser to explore more. The little Missouri River valley was beautiful with the late afternoon sun glinting off the golden cottonwood-lined stream and cream and white bluffs. Watching the focus and intensity of a coyote hunting in the high grass was riveting. The prairie dogs were a hoot, buffalo majestic, mule deer quietly grazing. Watching the moonrise and sunset over the rugged landscape was almost mystical. Easy to see what made Roosevelt a conservationist, and lucky for us he was.

We finally inched our way through them when there was room. Unreal!! The prairie dog towns are extremely active and fascinating to watch. They seem used to the cars and people but still give their warning sounds. We also saw wild horses and turkeys. What a fun visit! Took way too many photos but this is a special place.

We had a bison wander through the campground only two sites down from ours. What a great experience. We drove the loop through the South Unit and saw pronghorn, wild horses, turkeys, elk, mule deer, and bison. October is a wonderful time to visit because there aren't so many people.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My husband and I visited Theodore Roosevelt National Park during our tour of several National Parks this summer. There are three areas of this park: Painted Canyon, South Unit and North Unit. We stopped at the Painted Canyon and the South Unit during our visit.Our first stop was at the Painted Canyon area of the park. You will think this is a rest area but it is actually part of the park and has wonderful views so make sure that you take time to get out and walk around the area as well as using the restroom facilities here. I actually think that this is probably the prettiest area of the park.From Painted Canyon, we headed to the South Unit of the park. We stopped in the town of Medora on our way. We were hoping to find some lunch here before heading into the park. (Note: There are no food options in the park itself.) What we found was a few local restaurants. There were no chain restaurants in the town so if you are looking for something like that you will not find it. We decided to stop at the local convenient store and pick up some packages subs, some drinks and snacks to take with us. Upon entering the park, you will come to the Visitor's Center. There are some exhibits and nice restroom facilities. If you go outside the rear of the Visitor's Center there is a small log cabin where Theodore Roosevelt lived for a short time. There is a very short ranger guided tour that runs periodically (check for times) and you can enter the cabin and take photos. It's definitely worth the few minutes it takes for the tour.The park itself was similar to Badlands National Park, with plenty of badlands to be seen here. There are also grasslands mixed in with the badlands. As far as wildlife goes, we saw a few bison, some feral horses and lots of prairie dogs! The loop road took us about an hour to traverse. We did not do any hikes so if you plan on doing those, please add time. We visited on a Monday in August and there were only a few other cars in the park.

We thought the cannonball concretions in the north unit were most interesting. They were in a small area right beside the road. We would liked to have seen some of the caprock formations, but we were at the north unit before we found out the best area for that was the petrified forest. The drives in both units are well worth the time, but some of the short hikes didn't have much to see. We enjoyed Wind Canyon trail.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This was an unplanned stop on our way home from visiting Yellowstone National Park. We took the loop road which was 25 miles around the park and back to the nearby town of Medora. It was spectacular! Our first stop was to see the prairie dogs and their homes. It was so fun watching them eat and run around. Then next came a very large buffalo standing about 100 yards from the road. After we had driven almost an hour on the road we came upon a herd of about 15 wild horses. We could walk within about 20 yards of the herd. I stood and snapped pictures for about 20 minutes. Once we got back in the car one of the horses came down on the road and was standing facing the hood of my car. It was so beautiful to see these horses in the wild, including two babies. Farther down the road we did see another 4 horses where we saw the first prairie dogs. This is certainly one of America's most beautiful national parks and I would drive back to North Dakota in the future to see it again.

It is a lovely park. The drive is easy and there is so much to see, from the river to the rock formations to the badlands to the animals. There are two parts to this park, and next stop will include the northern sections. There are paths for hikers and plenty of places to pull over and take in the magnificent views. At the Medora visitor center, talk to the ranger in Roosevelt's cabin behind the center. Interesting story about how North Dakota made him the man he was.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"So most people may think you are odd for taking a vacation in North Dakota, but I had my eyes set on Theodore Roosevelt National Park for a while and it didn't disappoint. My favorite part...cars weren't riding your backside on the road and hikers weren't breathing down your neck on the trail. Yes, there were people at every overlook and trail head, but not nearly the numbers I have seen at other parks. I personally found the park very beautiful with relatively easy trails that most family members could do. It was fun to trace where the Little Mo ran and encounter the bison herds and prairie dogs of the park. This is definitely a park where the rain and storms can make photos even better, which is probably good because I think there is more weather this far north than in some other areas.I did both the north and south units of the park (including Painted Canyon) and I am glad I did. I can see why most people only hit the south unit, but equally enjoyed the north unit and felt it was a more intimate experience as the south unit is definitely more ""crowded"" if you can even use that term for a North Dakota park. Traveling with my 65 year old Mom, I didn't hike any difficult trails, but found the trails that we did very good with some great views. There are also plenty of overlooks, so if you did have someone with mobility issues, he or she could still have a pretty enjoyable experience.I can see why Teddy Roosevelt loved ranching in North Dakota. It's an underrated park, but that's precisely why I liked it.","September 4, 2015",A Beautiful Park You Can Have Some Peace In,3,,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Unusual landscape. Roads are well maintained. This park needs to be seen in the cool part of the day if you plan on any hiking. It was 101 when we went through...needed plenty of water. Plan on spending at least 3 hours if you stop for any vistas or some of ghe shorter hikes. Hikes can run from .2 of a mile yo 10 miles...you pick. Traills well marked. There is some elevation changes if you hike.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I lived in Minnesota as a kid, but somehow, we never seemed to make it to any of the top tourist spots back then. So now that I am older, I added Medora to my bucket list and I could not be more pleased about it. After we checked in to a local hotel, we attended the nightly musical, which is very well done, and obviously professionally managed and directed. Pitchfork fondue was a unique treat too. The next morning, we set out to see the Theodore Roosevelt National Park drive. It is 36 miles long, and takes about 2 hours if you stop for photo opportunities. I am so glad we took the time to do it! What a treat. Beautiful vistas with almost constant sightings of bison, prairie dogs, prongs (something like a deer but bigger), Took hundreds of pictures and hope they are good enough to help us recall the emotions we had as we viewed this beautiful area.","September 2, 2015",36 Miles of Absolute Beauty,37,"San Antonio, Texas",5

We did the Painted Canyon first and the short 1 mile hike. Had a blast. Moved on to the South unit and loved the vistas. Greeted on the first curve with a buffalo blocking the road. The short hikes with each overlook were great. Prairie dog town was humorous and very enjoyable. Using my binoculars, we spotted the wild horses on a ridge far from the road. Fun to see them in their natural environment. The day was hazing and slightly warm , but so glad the animals were out which added to the experience. We only had one day so we would like to come back and explore the North unit .","August 29, 2015",Simply amazing!,103,Oklahoma,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This was our first visit to the Medora area. It is beautiful. My college aged daughter and I decided do some hiking while our ""boys"" golfed at Bully Pulpit. The park entrance fee was $20.00 which was good for a week. The park rangers at the South Visit Visitor center were very helpful in helping us pick an adequate trail of about 5 miles round trip.We drove into the park about 2 miles to Peaceful Valley Ranch. There was a parking area but the ranch appeared to be vacant. We found the trail head for the Ekblom trail and about 1/2 mile later we had to wade across the Missouri River which was about ""knee high"" deep. We followed it to the Big Plateau trail going through the bluffs. It was so beautiful and peaceful. On top of the plateau there were hundreds of prairie dogs. They made alot of noise at us and then quickly dove into their holes with their little tails sticking out and wagging in the air. They were so cute and funny! We then took the Maah Daah Trail left and ended up going through some woody areas until we were in the bluffs again. There was a herd of buffalo right in the middle of trail and we walked off the trail because we didn't want to get too close. We took Ekblom Trail and had to cross another small creek and then the MIssouri River again back to the parking area. The whole hike was 5.4 miles. It was marked pretty well but most of the markers were just large poles in the ground and some of them had been knocked over by the Buffalo. Only the intersections with the new trails were marked with the names. There were a few times that we questioned if we were on the right trail but only for a few seconds. It was a nice trail with beautiful scenery and a moderately strenuous hike. We ran into a family of four at the beginning of the hike but didn't see anyone else the rest of the way.","August 29, 2015",Great day of hiking,30,"Appleton, Wisconsin",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt NP is a pretty awesome place to visit. Being a hiker this park offered numerous hiking opportunities, and I was able to do several. The Wind Canyon, Buck Hill, and Boicourt Overlook Trail trail are short easy hikes I did that I'd recommend to anyone. Ridgeline Trail is a bit harder but still short and I'd recommend for anyone. Jones Creek Trail I did as an out and back (about 7 miles total) rather than the larger loop where it combines with the Paddock Creek trails I believe, but Jones Creek by itself was my favorite hike that I was able to do on my visit. Petrified Forest trail was another good one but much longer, so I wasn't able to do the whole loop. I did get to see some of the Petrified tree stumps, as well as numerous bison.Aside from hiking, there are numerous ranger activities/hikes, camping, fishing, and lots of information and history to read about. Numerous overlooks, and some great picture opportunities. Also, the town of Medora seems like an interesting place to visit, thought I didn't get to spend much time there.Overall, one of my favorite NP visits, and I can't wait to plan a return trip. Highly Recommended.","August 28, 2015",Awesome National Park,79,"Utica, Ohio",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Gorgeous park! Loved the drive through - every turn gave a new beautiful view of the landscape. Exciting to see bison, feral horses, and other animals. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the resource. However, the infrastructure needs tons of work. I stayed in the campground (lots of shade, trees, and nice spots). The bathrooms in the campground were downright disgusting. It was obvious that the NPS maintenance workers hadn't been there in days, or if they had, they needed to actually clean the bathrooms. I tried to go to the evening program, which I have enjoyed at national parks across the country. But this park CHARGES A FEE for some of their evening programs!!! I have never in my life heard of this and thought it was appalling. You had to purchase a ticket (they were sold out at 3pm when I arrived) too, so it was limited in number. I also wanted to view the Theodore Roosevelt cabin. In the height of summer, they only gave 3 to 5 tours of it a day! Tours were free, but you had to luck out on time. I guess they don't have enough staff to have a ranger out there talking to visitors as they arrive, instead you have to wait (sometimes hours) to see it in a group of upwards of 40 people in a 3 room cabin. Crazy. I also attempted to visit TR's old cabin site, but was told by the ranger that the road was bad to impassible without him even asking if I had 4 wheel drive or not. The ranger stated it had been bad and when asked if it was being fixed, he shrugged. Unhelpful. Additionally, the north unit's visitor center is closed due to structural damage with no timetable for it to be fixed. Basically - the infrastructure and visitor services need a lot of work, but the park is beautiful. This could be an amazing park, but NPS needs to get it together at this one.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Named for the president who came to this area to clear his head, the national park is absolutely gorgeous. When we were driving up, we figured it would be large prairies and grasslands, like we'd seen on the way up. Then, all of a sudden, you make a turn and these gorges and valleys open up in front of you. Truly spectacular landscapes with picturesque colors. There are two parts, the north unit and the south unit. If you have time, they're both worthwhile, because they're quite different from each other. The south unit is the one closest to the Interstate, with a little town at the entrance with plenty of food and lodging options. The main feature of the South Unit is a loop road that takes you through most of the best views.The north unit is a fair piece from the Interstate, but you get to see some of the oil and gas boom going on there right now, which is interesting in and of its own right. Just like the south unit, the terrain looks fairly plain until you go up a hill and the river valley of the Little Missouri opens up in front of you. Unlike the south unit, the north unit is defined by the Little Missouri. It's eroded these massive hills, exposing big rocks called cannonball accretions. I find it very appropriate that the park named for the hero of San Juan Hill has rocks called cannonballs. Just like the south unit, the north unit has a main road through the park that takes you to most of the best views.You'll also see a lot of wildlife-we saw bison, tons of prairie dogs, eagles, and even a badger. We also saw a couple of rattlesnakes, so do stick to the trails and be careful going over rocks. I always recommend a hiking stick, so you can place the stick on the other side of the rock before your foot, just in case.Overall a fantastic park and well worth a visit!","August 23, 2015",Fitting Tribute to President Roosevelt and a Gorgeous Park,203,"Herndon, Virginia",5

Makes for some spectacular photography! There are camp grounds to accommodate those who want to stay inside the park and of course there's the town of Medora that offers the hotel accommodations as well. If you're given the opportunity to visit the park it's well worth the time invested! There are two entrances, one South (Medora entrance) and one North.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited the South section of this park. This is my husband's second time and my first. WOW! It is breathtaking! We did the 16 mile loop on our Harley. Just took our time and saw three or four herds of bison. One herd was about fifteen feet away. Wild horses, prairie dogs/prairie dog towns/ bald eagles/ lots of birds...and the landscape is absolutely other-worldly. Some of it is green and lush, other parts are dessert like. Do hike the trails off the road. We used our hiking poles and were fine. Lots of folks did not use poles. They trails are moderate, at best. Go as high as you can to get a different view. Take your time. Stop and smell the sagebrush and juniper. Look at the small flowers and the small rocks and the rock formations and let your imagination run wild. The visitor center is very nice, as well. We did stop at the ranch that is part way through and used the pit toilet. It was truly spotless. DO NOT MISS THIS LITTLE KNOWN GEM!

We tent camped, did the scenic drives, climbed a butte, did some short hikes, went to the main visitors center, saw Theodore Roosevelt's cabin with an excellent park ranger interpreter, sampled the local town (Medora), and attended one ranger talk. The stars were fantastic. We saw buffalo, dear, prairie dogs (in massive prairie dog towns), and pheasants. We hiked to a collection of petrified stumps. The north unit is very isolated and feels very off-the-beaten path. The south unit is more developed and more crowded. The rangers were fantastic in the two presentations we saw. And we couldn't get enough of the wonderful scenery -- which is fascinating when seen from a distance, and equally fascinating when inspected up close to see the other-worldly combination of ongoing erosion, sandstone, mud, plants, fire, and insects.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"TRNP offers a beautiful landscape and lots of bison. Our favorite hike was to the northern petrified forest whose trailhead is accessed via private property. Directions are available at the visitors' center. It should be noted that the trails are not wide and are often covered by long grass. After a few hours, the grass can be irritating on bare skin, so light pants or convertible pants would have been nice. During our couple of days we saw mule deer, elk, lots of prairie dogs and lots of bison. One of our kids' favorite activities was hiking up the formation behind the playground in Medora. We chose to stay in Dickinson which worked out well - only half an hour away and much better choices in lodging.","August 12, 2015",We liked the bison,34,"Evansville, Indiana",5

There are plenty of opportunities to catch great pictures of buffalo, prairie dogs, birds and wild horses! The landscape is beautiful. We hiked the painted canyon trail which was perfect for our time constraint. It was a mile loop. It's not a tough hike. I had a 13 year old, an 8 year old and a 5 year old with me, it was just the right length for the younger ones but still fun for the older boy. We then made our way to do the drive through the park. There are many spots to pull over and take pictures. Make sure to use the restroom before you go in to the drive. The only restroom is at the gate. We paid 20 dollars at the gate to drive the loop. Well worth it!!","August 11, 2015",Get back to nature,33,"Lake Park, Minnesota",5

As soon as we got to the top of the hill, we saw a Prairie Dog colony. Off in the distance was a lone bull Bison. Great photo opportunity. Further, we saw beautiful badlands hills and ravines.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Since I have spent a lot of time in other breathtaking national parks like Yosemite and Yellowstone, I was a little dissapointed. I was torn to rate it between average and very good. The badlands do have a unique beauty. We enjoyed seeing several wild horses, but for the most part you are driving around the park. There were some stops for hikes and small turnouts, but in my opinion, there were not enough places to stop and really enjoy the scenery and the turnouts were few and far between. We saw just a couple bison from a distance. This wouldn't be a national park that I would want to visit more than once--although I am glad that I got to see it.","August 8, 2015",See the badlands...,6,"Harvey, North Dakota",4

We arrived at the very end of the day when the park was closing, so there was almost no other traffic on the roads & we were able to really enjoy a leisurely drive. Unfortunately, we probably got there after the bison herd had mostly gone to the river already, so we only saw 2 of them alongside the road -- but that was enough for us. The park itself and its scenery were enough to make it worth our while.TIP: Stop at every lookout point. The views are worth the price of admission even without seeing a single bison!","August 7, 2015","Amazing views of the badlands; exciting ""interviews"" with bison",7,"La Grande, Oregon",4

Expected a close association with TR but, except for the Ranger talk and tour of a relocated cabin Roosevelt built in the area, it's all about the scenery.This is stunning scenery. Similar to the more widely known Badlands National Park, these badlands seem more green and lush compared to the Park to the south. The South unit of this Park can be viewed from the loop road in about an hour plus stops. We noticed Prairie Dogs, Bison and wild horses in our drive through the Park.All in all, what a great way to break the tedium of cross-country travel.

There were signs on just about every post and locating a site was confusing. We did not know about reservations for the camp grounds which was started this year. This creates confusion as signage is confusing. We eventually found the host and things were straightened out.Had I known about the reservations I would have made one.

That would take most of an entire day, we only had a couple hours. I think an early June or late September would be better visiting times. If in the area, take in this park. If you can stay overnight and spend an entire day you could see the entire park and get in some hiking too.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Unless you're into visiting all the national parks or states you may want to avoid this one. Its a long drive from everywhere and not much to do once you get there. We did see bison and cute prairie dogs, and a prong horn. The south end has a nice visitor center and is in a little town. There is a loop you can drive with a few short hikes to lookouts. Will take a few hours even if you do all the hikes and wait for the bison in the street. No bathroom facilities. We drove up to the north end which had even less. Visitor center was closed. I walked up a ramp to the rest rooms, saw the bathroom and a ranger who was painting outside yelled at me to get away and use Big John. Big John turned out to be the only facility in the park. North side was smaller. Nice views, more bison and cattle. There were very few trails and the ones that were there were not well marked. We did enjoy the Caprock Coulee trail in the North and the Ridgeline, Buck hill, and Wind Canyon trails in the South. SD Badlands was much better than this one.

Saw lots of Buffalo, prairie dogs, 2 Bald Eagles and several mule deer.We Highly recommend!!! Well worth your time to visit, hike and enjoy!We have never been fans of real ""touristy"" places, to use a more polite phrase.. Medora is a big time one, as are the over priced hotels.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent the better part of day in the two units of Theodore Roosevelt. Most of the park is driving, but there are opportunities for a few short hikes (and long ones if you're so inclined.) The visitors center talks of little other than Teddy Roosevelt (the National Park Service is rather cultish about him actually-and that's having just visited Mount Rushmore), but the beauty of the park is its animal and plant life along with its beautiful landscape. We were on our way back from Yellowstone, and had seen plenty of bison, pronghorn, and elk, but seeing them in this setting is somehow more intimate, if for no other reason than the fact that the park is relatively little visited. You can take your time and take it all in at overlooks or along short trails with little to no interruption from anyone else.Make sure to find time for the North Unit. It is a bit of a haul (50 or so miles north of I-94), but it is a gem. The Badlands are much more visually rugged (though the driving is just as easy) and it makes the South Unit feel as busy as Yellowstone.

There is also a nice 36-mile drive through the park with overlooks and trailheads clearly marked. The Wind Canyon overlook and hike is a must - it is short and relatively easy so most people will be able to do it.,"July 13, 2015",Beautiful NP,52,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,Camped at the Medora south unit campground and had buffalo roaming in the campground. Beautiful drive with scenic badlands as a backdrop .Hundreds if not thousands of prairie dogs in the different Prairie Dog Towns. Wild horse herds and buffalo. The buffalo walk the roads and they own the roads. Great visit. Highly recommend the south unit of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park.,"July 13, 2015",Buffalo galore,17,Savannah,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"When we camped in the South Unit, outside Medora, we expected no water/electric at the site. No problem. However, we were very surprised to learn there was NO dump station nor any shower facilities. The closest restrooms to our campsite were vault toilets that were FILTHY and SWARMING WITH FLIES. When you opened up the door the flies swarmed up in a big black cloud, including OUT of the toilet. Disgusting! On our fourth camping day we discovered FLUSH toilets just 100 feet beyond the vaults. WHY were there no signs? WHY did the campground host not tell us? Sites were small, tight, and there were no fire rings -- just BBQ grills. We were told if we wanted a dump station we had to drive 75-miles to the North Unit. There is a campground in Medora (Red Trails) that will let you dump for a fee. That being said, the park is very basic. Don't expect any comfort stations along the 30-mile loop or at any trailheads. If you hike any of the longer trails, expect buffalo -- we encountered bulls on all three of the longer hikes we attempted. They are temperamental and some have a lower tolerance for people than others, so just be aware. Signage on the trail is also problematic. Many of the trail posts are flimsy and have fallen over, probably years ago. Some of the sturdier posts (4x6) are used by the bison as scratching posts and also have been knocked over. Shorter hikes, usually to scenic overlooks, were buffalo-free!The highlight for us was the ranger-led Petrified Forest hike. It is offered every Saturday at 8 am and usually is around 3 miles. Because we were a small group, we elected to go ""off trail"" and saw some absolutely amazing geology and had to climb way up to skirt around a bull bison who didn't appreciate our presence. He actually stood up and raised his tail, which is a warning sign that they are annoyed! Our hike ended up being about 4.5 miles, and it was absolutely the highlight of our visit. Be sure to take PLENTY of water, and good hiking footwear is essential. My husband and I took our hiking poles and we were NOT sorry, especially on the off-trail segment. We love our Federal Parks and have been to many. This was has to rate lowest on our list. However, we understand the former superintendent just retired and a new one has started. Hopefully she will begin to make many of the upgrades that the park definitely needs.","July 11, 2015",Campgrounds Spoiled the Experience,80,"Russellville, AR",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Like the history of the park but this was overshadowed by wildlife we viewed. Saw Bison, Pronghorn antelope, and several bands of wild horses. In fact the Bison were quite close and a stallion reminded us that we had a truck to stay in. We do respect wild life and know you can get in trouble with it. If you plan to stay in the campground it is small and hard to get into, We could not get into a spot so we went back to town. Loved the park though.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Took a late evening and early morning drive in mid-June and saw wild horses, mule deer, pronghorn, bison, a coyote, prairie dogs, and quite a few species of birds. But very few people. The absence of other wildlife-seeking tourists made this a special experience on our way to the more well-known national parks in the west. If you planning to camp at Cottonwood Campground, I recommend Site #47. Lots of privacy and overlooks the river. This site can be reserved. From the overlook at the end of the Wind Canyon Trail, we watched the sun set while a herd of bison grazed peacefully along the banks of the Little Missouri River below.

Also, take time to check out all of the amazing views.If you're in the southern unit, keep an eye out for wild horses and one of the best hiking trails (in my opinion ;) ) is the Jones Creek trail.Our kids all completed the Junior Ranger program and were sworn in and received their badges and were thrilled with the experience.

Despite the heat, I had the chance to see plenty of wildlife, and enjoy a scenic drive and hike through the park. I only spent half a day there, but could easily have stayed longer and seen so much more. I passed through some lovely camp grounds and I quickly wished I had more time to stay - the loop drive was very scenic and there were plenty of places to get out and take pictures of the stunning scenery and abundance of flora/fauna. Plan at least a day if you want to do it up right. The visitor center is small, but has clean restrooms, a helpful staff, and short films about the area that run continuously throughout the day. Medora is a charming little town right next to the park entrance that is a great place to pick up some souvenirs and recharge your body at one of the local restaurants...

There are hiking trails for all levels of physical ability. The Buck Trail (a short hike) takes you to a vista that makes you feel like you're standing on top of the world.

Did you know that prairie dogs chat to each other? We also came across several groups of wild horses - some pregnant, some nursing. A lovely site. The rolling hills with greenery were very peaceful and we enjoyed several short walks. Right now (June 2015) the north unit visitor center is closed - so be sure to check http://www.nps.gov/thro/ for the latest news. Take the drives and walks and watch the movie about Theodore Roosevelt. It is worth your time. It was cloudy when we were there - so no beautiful night sky.

The south unit is next to Medora and is teeming with bison, wild horses, and prairie dogs. We took a beautiful hike to get a feel for the rugged landscape and there's also a 34 mile scenic drive. Stop at the Visitor's Center at the south end and you'll see the original cabin TR had built--the Maltese Cross. It survives and you can experience a guided tour. The Elkhorn Ranch, which he had built subsequently, did not survive and you can only see the foundation. The north unit is very desolate and there is no Visitor's Center--it was condemned. Same landscape is found north and wildlife as well. Crazy thing is the north unit is on Central time while the south is Mountain time. The Missouri River is the line of demarcation for the time zone.

As to the park, it was more interesting than I expected. It doesn't have the spectacular scenery that many of the western US NP's have but the connection to Roosevelt was very interesting and well explained by the park staff in their (free) tour of Roosevelt's ranch house on the grounds of the visitor center.

Went to the petrified forest in the South Unit which was worth it for the hike alone and the petrified forest was amazing! I just loved the terrain. Really this park could be another Yellowstone if they opened up the National Grasslands between the two units to Buffalo instead of to cattle ranchers. We traveled in a circle around the North Unit. It is a long drive but worth it in the sense that the oilmen have created a different world full of men in white fleet trucks and living in trailers.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We love our National Parks! We had never heard of this one before, but we wanted to check North Dakota off our states list, so we thought this was a great destination. We arrived in Medora around 2 p.m. and really only had a few hours to enjoy the park. The 36-mile scenic drive was really the perfect way to do this. We stopped at the Visitor's Center first and enjoyed the well-made 17-minute introductory video. The gift shop is really nice and has a good variety of options. Then we set out for the drive. The prairie dogs were absolutely the cutest things I'd ever seen. Bison are magnificent and plentiful, but the ""dogs"" stole it for us! (Turns out they're from the rodent family!) It was a super overcast and sprinkly day so the views weren't as stunning as they might normally be, but we did take a bit of time to walk the Wind Canyon trail (0.3 miles each way). It was very worth it--the canyon isn't anything I could have imagined and we were the only ones out...our voice echoed off the canyon walls and you really could see for miles. One note: On the 36-mile drive, there is only one place with a bathroom--the Cottonwood Campground, which is right close to the Visitor's Center. So plan ahead! Overall, we are really glad we came and had this experience and would recommend it to others!","May 25, 2015","Natural, off-the-grid location!",49,"Davenport, Iowa",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Going to this National Park was my sole reason for visiting North Dakota (well, and to visit ND in general). I am so glad I did this.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We are fortunate in being able to travel off season. Almost as soon as we arrived, we did the wildlife loop. In 3 hours (lots of photo stops), I think we passed 5 other cars, total. But oh boy were the bison out! For whatever reason, all the bison we saw were males and they were HUGE. I didn't need warning signs reminding me that these were wild animals. As an aside, the ranger told us that the previous season some jerk had tried to get a picture of his 2 year old sitting on a calf! Somehow, all survived that encounter. The next day we did the northern part of the park. Lots more bison, also elk, mule deer, antelope, a gazillion prairie dogs. No bear (sigh), but great views. I wish I knew the names of all the birds. I saw blue birds, the usual red-winged blackbirds, hawks, a couple of flocks of turkeys, and a couple of wading birds and finches that I couldn't come close to identifying.Major great park.","May 12, 2015",Seriously Charismatic Mega Fauna,160,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

I just loved parking beside the prairie dog towns and watch their busy little lifestyles and cute little ""barks."" How fun.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is one of the most beautiful, breathtaking parks in America. We started out at the south entrance around 9 a.m. in mid-April and didn't see another car until we were a few miles short of the exit. Except for a few intermittent glimpses of I-94, we could've been on another planet. It's so cool to hit this rocky, rugged area after driving for hours across Dakota prairie. We saw at least 5 herds of buffalo, 3 wild horses, and a couple thousand prairie dogs. I understand you can drive through the park at anytime, but we waited for the headquarters in Medora to open to grab a map. We were glad we did as the National Park Ranger gave us tips on which were the shortest--yet most worthwhile--trails to take my aging parents on. We stopped a few times to stretch our legs and walked between just .2 and .3 miles to incredible vistas. It's easy to see why Teddy loved this part of the country so deeply! We didn't have time to do the northern section this trip, but I'm determined to revisit this park again and again. If you're driving across ND, you truly must, must stop here. Better yet: Plan on staying the night in nearby Medora. ","April 15, 2015",Had the park to ourselves in April!,23,Duluth,5

Also saw a few elk & pronghorn. We drove up to the north unit which is 52 miles away. We don't think the north unit was worth the drive.

Wild horses, deer and prairie dogs were around almost every corner. Watching the prairie dogs pop out of their holes is a fun way to pass some time for adults and children alike.I took a couple of short hikes but due to traveling solo, I didn't want to hike too deep into the park.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Take your time exploring this area- The hiking trails are very well marked and kind to the less able. A map is supplied when you check in at the station; if you intend to be in the area for more than a day get the annual pass for $5 more and use it at the North Unit also. The park is well patrolled, family oriented, handicap accessible, and clean. Every one of the staff and volunteers we met were very gracious. The hikes are of good length. Be observant- you will encounter massive petrified wood specimens, vast prairie dog towns, large herds of buffalo, and beautiful vistas of the canyon. I will always recommend a hiking stick and ample water whatever the season. Prairie rattlesnakes can be found their habitat- look, listen, and stick to the trails. Watch and your footing but occasionally stop to scan the area you are headed into sometime lone bulls will be resting in peace; give them respectable distance to observe them.","December 27, 2014",The Grand Canyon of North Dakota,37,,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"As we fought the oil field traffic all the way across northern North Dakota, we finally got to Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the badlands of the northwest portion of the state. It was a refuge from all those oil rigs, mobile homes, and freight trucks. We spent two nights camping in the North Unit of the park, and I highly recommend this over the South Unit. Beautiful campground (no hookups in the Park in either unit's campgrounds) and plenty to do. We did an all-day hike, taking our time along the Caprock Coulee Trail experiencing vistas, gulches, and varied terrain. Then a relaxing ""flop"" in the Little Missouri River running next to the campground just to cool off. They have very nice, informal evening programs, too. Lovely park and full of wildlife. We really enjoyed the bison and prairie dogs as well. We got rained out of our planned Petrified Forest hike in the South Unit where we only spent one night. But again, a very nice campground as well as a lovely visitor center in Medora. Theodore Roosevelt should be a must for you if you are visiting the Dakotas.

Terrain is rugged and beautiful. Highlights included watching a young coyote stalk prarie dogs and my eight year old discovering a nice sized rattlesnake on a trail. Favorite hike was the Petrified Forest Plateau where you hike among giant petrified tree stumps (it's a long hike but there's a shorter version that you can get directions to in the visitor center). Wind Canyon was just a short walk but very beautiful particularly in the evening. Campsites were nice but the facilities are primitive and reservations are not taken.

Only at the main entrance & a campground about 5 miles in(which was very yucky we travel & camp a lot & it may have been the worst I have ever seen).

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I have been to Theodore Roosevelt National Park dozens of times, but it still takes my breath away. The rugged landscape is incredible, both beautiful and desolate at the same time. TRNP is home to hundreds of bison, wild horses, white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, prairie dogs, coyotes, etc. Even if you drive through and don't see a single animal (which I'm fairly certain is not possible), you'll still be utterly amazed by your surroundings. If you really want to see wildlife, the best times of day are early morning (get up at least an hour before dawn, it's totally worth it, I promise) and just before dusk. If you go to http://www.sunrisesunset.com/usa/north_dakota.asp you can enter a month and print a calendar of sunrise/sunset times for Medora. Try to wear neutral/earth tone colors--I know the jury is still out on whether or not animals are color blind, but just from personal experience I can tell you that I definitely wasn't wearing any bright colors when my best photos were taken. Oh, and don't forget your camera... and a tripod, if you're really serious about getting great pics!While summer is obviously the most popular season for tourists, the off-season certainly has its perks, too. Not nearly as many tourists, for one. There isn't any road construction, and the animals are more likely to be out due to decreased traffic throughout the park. However, if you go in the winter, dress warmly! And be aware that some of the roads may be closed due to ice/snow. Check the TRNP website for road closure information (http://www.nps.gov/thro/index.htm).**Tip for campers: Get to the campground as early as you possibly can, especially if you have a camper!

We arrived Oct.1, 2014 and stated for 3 nights in Medora's Rough Riders Hotel. While the road repair in the south unit still hadn't been completed, the work had stopped so there were no delays in traveling the scenic loop. Frequent bison sightings, lots of cute prairie dog towns stunning scenery with a good number of overlooks and short trails were all along the loop. One day we drove to the North Unit and drove its scenic drive. Again, stunning scenery with goodly numbers of viewpoints. At one we spotted big horn sheep (we were told they were there by a park ranger at another viewpoint). The drive to the north had us use a busy two lane filled with trucks servicing the oil boom towns just by the Park.I had imagined a very arid area but these Badlands had much more vegetatoon than other Badland areas we had visited. A ranger told us that it had been wetter than usual, and they had had an inch and a half of rain the day befor we arrived. The trails were very muddy at places and that had cut short some of our planned hiking. We also encountered very strong winds, near 30mph, which coupled with temperatures in the upper 30s lower 40s in the AM made for brutal going at times. But PMs were better and the winds temps became milder as we left. Just be prepared for these extremes if you go in October.","October 13, 2014",Overlooked Gem,25,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5

There are several pullouts along the drive with informational placards describing the area. Some reviewers mentioned not seeing any animals but we saw plenty-lots of bison, deer and wild horses. The best times to see wildlife are early morning and evening. The park's North Unit is about an hour north of the South Unit. The landscape is a little more rugged and barren than the South Unit. At the South Unit's visitor center, you can go through Teddy Roosevelt's cabin and/or take a guided tour of it with a park ranger. I loved this park.

We did the South unit and found the Wind Canyon Trail - only .4 miles - absolutely breathtaking and the best site within the South unit. Definitely worth the quick stop! Take your camera!Did you know that the park has feral horses? Though the horses aren't native to the area, the park has recognized their historical significance and keeps a small number, about 100, in the park for visitors to enjoy. The horses are ""wild"" and shouldn't be approached. Every few years, the horses are rounded up and some are removed from the park to ensure there is enough natural food for everyone. The horses that leave the park are adopted/sold to horse lovers around the world. Learn more at http://www.nps.gov/thro/naturescience/feral-wild-horses.htm and https://www.facebook.com/NDBadlandsHorse. North Dakota Badlands Horse is a federal 501(c)(3) public charity that promotes, advocates for and registers the wild horses in TRNP as of 2009. While my husband and I were visiting, we met a group on horseback. Three of the horses were originally from TRNP and have now been trained and have found homes.During our drive through the park, we enjoyed views of buffalo, deer, prairie dogs and even a coyote.

The people who worked there were also very informative. We wanted to go to the petrified forest part of the park, but it had just rained, and the ranger advised against it as the trail would be so slippery - we appreciated that info.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt National Park is apparently the least visited national park in the United States. That is a shame as it is stunningly beautiful with abundant wildlife and great hiking opportunities. The park is separated in two units with the Little Missouri Grassland in-between the two units. The south unit is accessible off I-94 and the town of Medora, although small, has all the services you need. The north unit is further north off highway 85 and essentially has no services. We visited both and fell in love with the park. While visiting we saw numerous bison, elk, wild horses and white-tailed deer as well as countless prairie dogs. We didn't unfortunately see the Texas long-horned cattle which are in the north unit.The scenery is quite gorgeous and unspoiled and at no time did we find the park crowded or packed with tourists.

Great day.","September 25, 2014",Awesome experience.,1,"Lebanon, Oregon",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,This place took my breath away and brought tears of joy to my eyes! As we pulled in to the park we were greeted by a huge herd of Long Horned Steer and Buffalo! What a spirit lifter after driving across northern North Dakota and seeing all the destruction and disruption of land and lives caused by tracking of natural gas. Very sad and sickening trip across once beautiful northern North Dakota.,"September 22, 2014",Beautiful,3,"Lancaster County, Pennsylvania",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I visited the South Unit of the park only. The North Unit, about 50 miles away, is apparently the more scenic, with better opportunities to see wildlife.The town of Medora, in the South Unit, is the starting point for the drive into the Badlands area. The town is pretty, although overrun with tourists when I was there in August. Unfortunately, tourists weren't the only ones there: hundreds of wasps, which swarmed around me and even got into my car! The clerks in the quaint, ""frontier-style"" stores were very welcoming, and the woman at the Visitor Center was helpful with directions into the park.I didn't realize that half of the 36-mile scenic drive was a horribly dusty rough gravel road, which meant that, as I was driving, I had to focus more on my car's shock absorbers than the scenery! [Don't drive it if your vehicle isn't in top condition!] Relief came when I stopped at the 6 or 7 lookout points on the route. My favourite was Badlands Overlook because here you can see the colourful and dramatic cliffs and gorges for miles. As for wildlife, all I saw were two herds of buffalo [one very close to the road; the other on the edge of a cliff in the distance], plus thousands of prairie dogs that seem to have claimed the park for themselves!I would rate this place higher if it were not for the unpleasant experience of driving over its road!","September 20, 2014",Prepare for 'rough riding',233,"Edmonton, Canada",3

Took the loop drive and some nice short nature hikes. Interesting ranger presentation about light pollution, oil production and bird migration. Drove to Painted Canyon and North unit the next day.

We walked two hiking trails and drove the park several times to see the abundance of animals. We walked next to several small herds of wild horses. They were really beautiful and healthy looking. Their colors were different than you typically see with the selectively bred tame horses. Very interesting!We also saw many, many prairie dogs and several very large herds of bison. We were able to sit and watch the herd interaction of one very large herd. It was amazing and well worth the very long drive from the Midwest.","September 11, 2014",Wonderful!,19,"Lawrenceburg, Indiana",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent part of two days here. We were hoping for a lot of animal sightings but the elk remained hidden. We did see prairie dogs--tons of them--wild horses and some bison. The road construction made driving dirty and bumpy. We did a few shorter trails but the highlight was probably the hike to the petrified forest area. There is a route that cuts the hike to 3 miles. And the petrified wood was so neat to see. If you get here in the morning (we didn't), one day is enough to do everything that you want to do, unless you are a major hiker.","September 8, 2014",Wish we had seen elk,194,"Englewood, Florida",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My husband and I have visited over 30 National Parks in the US to include those 10 most highly ranked. I would put this park in my top five. I believe early September is an ideal time to visit . . . The crowds are gone and it is still warm. Because of it's location in western North Dakota, it might seem too out of the way for many travelers. However, if you are aware of Teddy Roosevelt's contributions to our conservation efforts and you know how he felt about the influence of this region upon his life and personal growth, then you will be compelled to visit here.We stayed in Medora, a charming entrance town to the South Unit of the park, with good lodging, restaurants, activities, and shops. We visited both the South and North Units and we're not disappointed in either. The North Unit is a 70 mile north of the South Unit, but well worth the drive. It is more dramatic and has a more remote feel to it. We drove the South Unit at sunrise and were rewarded with all of the wildlife others have remarked about, in addition to seeing the magnificent way the rising sun played against the mesas and buttes of the Badlands. There is nothing ""touristy"" about this park. Even the ""tourists"" themselves seem more kind and peaceful.

Miles of stunning vistas lay before us as we rode the 36 miles winding loop road through the South Unit of the park marvelling at the spectacular views and the herds of bison and wild horses roaming freely. We hiked the Ridge Line and Buck Hill trails which were well worth the climb for the magnificent views they provided. Although we saw some wildlife we were disappointed to find, after picking up the park visitor guide newspaper, that to see elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, and long horn steers one must go to the North Unit which we were unable to do. The ranger talk at Roosevelt's Maltese Cross cabin behind the visitor center was excellent and included great information about Roosevel't time in the North Dakota Badlands.

I almost made this mistake the first time I visited, not realizing how many times we would stop to view/photograph the abundant wildlife this park contains while driving along the 36 mile loop around the parks 70,000+ acres. There are prairie dog towns that span acres, a large herd of free roaming bison, eagles, and don't forget the wild mustangs, just to name a few of the rare and beautiful animals that can be found here. Elk and antelope are also common, as well as big horn sheep. I have even had the fortune to see a beautiful mountain lion in this park. Charge up your camera and clear your memory cards.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Theodore Roosevelt National Park is the best kept secret as far as national parks go. My husband and I spent three days and nights in Medora, North Dakota, and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We spent one full day in the South Unit of the park and another full day in the North Unit of the park. The two units are about 60 miles apart, but both are well worth the time. The scenery is spectacular, and the wildlife viewing opportunities were numerous. We especially enjoyed seeing a herd of 50+ bison crossing the road right in front of our vehicle, wild horses, deer, elk, and countless prairie dogs, who are so entertaining to watch. Both units of the park include a wide variety of hikes, from short and easy, to moderate, to challenging. If you don't enjoy hiking, both units have scenic drives that allow you to experience the park's stunning scenery from your vehicle. I can't say enough great things about Theodore Roosevelt National Park. It's a beautiful place!","September 2, 2014",Best kept secret in N.D.,9,Omaha,5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We camped near the park with kids and grandkids. The park is divided into 3 units. Most visit only the south. This has great information, original cabin and hiking. The best part was going with a ranger on the tour to the original Roosevelt ranch. The caravan is limited to days of week and number of people so call ahead. It avoids getting lost on the back roads. Once there you can see the original trees, rocks mark the home site etc. It is easy to feel why he chose this place. We took a day to drive to the northern part; also toured forts while up there, saw the new energy boom. It is difficult to find a campground up north outside the park due to many living there full time. Pack food for a picnic.","September 2, 2014",Roosevelt National Park,37,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I ended my last roadtrip in Teddy Roosevelt National Park. It was the perfect stop between Glacier NP and my home in Iowa. I am SO very glad I stopped for two days in this gorgeous park that I'd literally heard NOTHING about. I camped in the tent-only section of the grounds in a big wide site under a giant cottonwood and surrounded by golden prairie grass. The badlands stretched for miles and miles. For wider views of them definitely take the lengthy but beautiful day-trip up to the North Unit! The view from there is incredible and our car was stopped for 20 minutes because the road was completely covered by buffalo! They surrounded our car and it was awesome! We found the wild horses at sunset in the north-eastern corner of the South Unit- there were about 3 dozen of them. It was unreal. There are several prairie dog towns where the little guys are out and about and all over the place- so fun to watch. The park itself was so peaceful as it is definitely one of the lesser known ones. It should get more attention, though! It is BEAUTIFUL. It differs from the South Dakota badlands in the sense that these are more colorful and grassy. And it was really neat to learn about Teddy Roosevelt and the inspiring person that he was. The visitor center video is worth a watch, too. Great place for exploring and relaxing. Don't just pass over this park. Pull off the interstate and enjoy it!","September 2, 2014",One word: Underrated.,26,"Des Moines, Iowa",5

Next morning we drove the park's 36-mile loop, where we saw wild horses, buffalo, and surprisingly beautiful scenery.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The park has three units, 'south', 'north' and 'ranch', separated by about 100 miles of road driving, although if you were hiking or horse-trekking they are much closer together. We only had one day, so chose the ""south"" and ""north"" units. The ""ranch"" unit is, apparently, where Theodore Roosevelt had his ranch, back well before he became president of the U.S.Anyway, the south unit is beautiful, fairly heavily wooded (for this part of the world), and covered with wild (OK, ""feral"") horses. We found at least six families (stallion, mare and colt or filly) our our visit. You won't miss out on the buffalo, either! The park signs warn that buffalo are dangerous and ""view from afar"" but the park service didn't tell the buffalo , who stopped traffic on the scenic loop, stuck their heads inside open car windows, and generally created a 2o minute ""buff-jam"".The north unit is dryer and less popular...but, perhaps, more spectacular. Both places have their charm and beautiful views of the river, rock formations, etc.And, when we were there, both units had most of their campground spaces EMPTY! Made us want to run home and get our camping gear!

We saw wild horses and so many buffalo and prairie dogs. The buffalo crossed the road right by our car. The prairie dogs were so cute and fun to watch.

It was a great time to see animals as the day began to cool. Early morning and late afternoon the animals are our and moving around to feed. It proved to be the perfect time. First we saw the prairie dog village with hundreds of barking prairie dogs scurrying about. Our grandchildren loved the antics of these comical creatures. On our drive we saw at least four different herds of the beautiful wild horses. The foals were running and jumping in the tall grass and wonderful yellow flowers. It was a perfect setting for pictures. We came over the ridge to a breathtaking view of more than 300 buffalo. They were on both sides of the road, by the car, across the road and grazing on the hillside. It was an awesome reminder of what the west must have been like.when hundreds of buffalo roamed free. It is wonderful to know that these animals too my roam free in this massive park.We did not have time this trip to go to the northern gate 52 miles away. However, the scenery at that gate is very different with high cliffs, the meandering river and gorgeous views. We also spent some time walking the trails with awesome views of this beautiful landscape.

What I wasn't prepared for was the absolute simplistic beauty in this park. It has campsites (where I will stay next time,) is hiker friendly, houses an amazing number of incredibly big and beautiful bison, prairie dogs villages and for me the best of all is the wild horses. The topography of the park varies from grasslands to the spectacular scenery of the painted hills of the park. When I was photographing the wild horses and bison, I would get drawn by the gorgeous scenery behind the horses. The town of Medora sits right near one of the park entrances. The city is well kept and even though it is not big, it houses good food, some great shops, (even one of the gas station had so much ""stuff"" that I had to be pulled away) and very nice hotels.

Be sure and do all the short little hikes along the 32 mile loop through the park. There are great views from all of them. We were able to see buffalo, wild horses and prairie dogs. The people at the visitor center were very helpful and the short movie was worth taking the time to see. If you are going to be hiking, be sure and take plenty of water as there is no where to get any once you leave the visitor center. It's $10.00 per car to get into the park. If you are just taking the drive around the loop, you will probably only need a couple hours. We spent 4 hours here, but we took in all the little trails and spent some time at the end of each one. The town of Medora at the entrance to the park was a neat little town with shops, restaurants, trail rides and a great view from anywhere you chose to sit. It was fun to just meander through and talk to other tourists. The only negative was the unfriendly clerks at almost every store which was quite surprising for a tourist town. The Badlands in both South and North Dakota are awesome, but they are truly different. South Dakota has the craggy rocky peaks and North Dakota has more rolling hills with a lot of vegetation.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"It is a park that is unknown to many. We went to the park with friends. It's considered the Badlands of North Dakota. The Petrified Forest is amazing. Just know you have to hike in for 45 minutes to get to it. OH, and if there is any chance of rain at all, don't do it! We got caught in a small rain storm. We found very little cover. Getting wet is no big deal but when that air gets wet the ashy soil turns to slick muddy oil. A hill that took us 5 minutes to get down took 45 minutes to get up because we had NO traction. It's extremely slick when it gets wet. The Ridgeline Trail, the Coal Vein trail are all relatively easy hikes with some good views. The Painted Canyon is also a great hike, still good for a novice hiker but know when you walk down to the bottom of the canyon, you have to walk back up to get out.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Only visited the South Unit. Good visitor centre, showing Theodore Roosevelt's profound influence on conservation in the USA. Good program of events. Interesting drive around the 36 mile scenic loop. Especially fun are the numerous prairie dog 'towns', which can't fail to entertain. There are a variety of walks for all abilities. We did see a few bison & some wild horses. Overall though, with the delightful exception of the prairie dogs, there was less wildlife that we had expected to see, but I guess that's just the luck of the draw. We walked the Jones Creek, Roundup Trail & found that a number of the sign markers were broken & laying on the ground & more were needed at crucial points along the way. There needs to be more substantial posts. We had to backtrack a few times along the way, as our path forward was unclear.","July 18, 2014","Gentle, Colourful Patchwork of Hills",164,"London, United Kingdom",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"What an incredibly beautiful National Park! The scenery is amazing. And I saw more wildlife here than in any other National Park. This is probably because this is a more ""remote"" and less-visited park. I hope it stays that way. It is wide-open and wonderful. Truly not to be missed. We began in the North Unit because we read there is more wildlife there. And we did see many prairie dogs (very close!) and several herds of bison. This would have been enough!But when we visited the South Unit the next day, we began our day by seeing wild horses! What beautiful creatures. After watching them for a while, we went on to see more prairie dogs and then came upon what was to be just the first of many bison sightings of the day! Some were alone, some in herds, some extremely close, and we were fortunate enough to see calves! It was a wonderful experience. Before the day was over, we saw pronghorn antelope as well. This has become my new Favorite National Park. If you get the chance to visit, DO NOT miss it!","July 13, 2014",Amazingly Beautiful,99,"Austin, Texas",5

Herds of bison, wild horses, antelope, and prairie dogs (lots of them). So glad we didn't pass up the visit thinking it was just more of what we had already seen.

We ended up in the midst of the herd as they traveled to a pasture on the other side of the road. Do be aware that the park has a rather aggressive road reconstruction area within the park. They are using a pilot car to move traffic through the area and there may be a short wait involved. Also the weather has been abnormally wet in the area which makes for some muddy hiking conditions, but also a lush green and yellow(from the clover) color to the landscape. It was a great photo opportunity.","June 28, 2014",Always something new to see,13,"West Fargo, North Dakota",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Teddy Roosevelt National Park is amazing. I visited both the South and North sections of the park - both unique enough to visit both areas. I loved seeing the buffalo roaming through the pork, the longhorn cattle, the white tail deer. I liked the loop drives. I did both the roads - i .e. the south loop road and also the north road. The north road had many interesting turn outs to learn about the history of the area. The colors in the park are amazing - and they change. Colors will change as the sun comes out in full or as clouds come over the sky to darken. It is like seeing an active artist in action.My initial reaction when coming to Teddy Roosevelt National Park was ""meh"" - am I really here for two days. By the end of the two days I became a fan and loved the park. The grasslands surrounding the park area are interesting too - they have so much variability in them when at first you just think - its green.On this trip I visited both South Dakota Badlands and Teddy Roosevelt National Park and I must say I personally and in my humble opinion prefer Teddy Roosevelt National Park with the river that runs through it.We also saw many prarie dogs.On the drive to the northern section of the park, the road is busy due to the energy business boom there.

Otherwise you'll see more Buffalo and be closer to them than anywhere else. MUST take the hiking paths, at least two are short (but steepish) but give unparalleled views of the river and park expanse. Do also go back in the p.m. when the gate is open and the roadways are fully open.

We took the 36-mile scenic loop drive in the South Unit. Be sure to pick up a map at the Visitor Center or the entrance gate, and talk to the ranger on duty for suggestions. The overlooks and trails are well marked along the route and on the map. Just before the Boicourt Overlook (traveling counterclockwise), we came across a herd of wild horses. It was so neat just watching them grazing along the ridge and in the valley. This was a sight we hadn't seen in the more well-known national parks that we had previously visited. A little farther along the road was a prairie dog town and a huge herd of bison. We loved the Wind Canyon Trail, with beautiful vistas of the Little Missouri River.

The park was gorgeous! We saw buffalo, wild horses, prairie dogs, and pronghorn. Word to the wise...if you want to see wildlife, you need to slow down and look. If you just want to race thru the loop, then you won't see anything so don't bother. Was annoyed by the amount of people racing thru here.","June 21, 2014","Beautiful park, but road construction",170,"Orlando, Florida",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"If you want to see wild buffalo and horses, head to the South Unit! The campgrounds are clean and quiet; the sites are well-spaced and many were near the river. They were also full to bursting with buffalo. Not only do they graze around the bathroom (a bit startling in the middle of the night), but they also join you for coffee at breakfast and routinely wander into campsites. You will also see tons of wild horses, deer, mule deer, elk, and squeaky prairie dogs.I would highly recommend the Petrified Forest Hike - it will take you through two beautiful groves of petrified trees and across miles of high plains. We entered through the west side of the park, and I would highly suggest four wheel drive and a high-clearance vehicle (we had a Dodge Avenger, and it got beat up pretty quickly on the rocks). Do the lower loop of the trail first - this will take you through the bigger forest and up and down the steep hills at the beginning of the hike, instead of at the end when you're tired (it's a 10.3 mile hike). Most of the hike is on high, exposed prairie, so take tons of water and sunscreen.My only critique of the park is one that they are not responsible for: visible oil rigs on all the horizons. From the top of every mountain you can see rigs in the distance, circling the entire park. The park is beautiful, and I am extremely glad the land is protected, but it showed me that we are not doing nearly enough in this country to protect both land and wildlife.","June 18, 2014","Buffalo, horses, and oil rigs",30,"Baltimore, Maryland",4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We planned to tour both the South and North Units during our visit. Upon arrival at Painted Valley Visitor Center, the young worker (not a Ranger) told us the road through the North Unit was closed only a short distance into the Unit and would not open for weeks. After viewing the very scenic overlook and spending time trying to take long distance shots of the local small herd of bison (thinking that may be my only chance - not even close to true as it turned out), we went on to the South Unit visitor center and looked at the artifacts, Theodore Roosevelt cabin, and grounds. We chatted with a Ranger who confirmed the closing and offered the sentiment that the 70 mile drive would be essentially a waste of time, we resigned ourselves to touring the South Unit in the morning which we did very early the next day. Not far into the park, my worry that the initial bison encounter would be our only chance was dispelled - multiple sightings of them, Pronghorns, Prairie Dogs, Wild Horses, and Mule Deer on the drive. The scenery was amazing and the drive was extremely enjoyable. By accident we returned to the Ranger station later in the afternoon and a different ranger told us the road in the North Unit was open and that the drive up there was well worth the effort. Turns out she was both right and wrong. The road was not open, but the trip was well worth it - more great scenery and a wolf sighting (logic says it was coyote but I have seen plenty of those and this sure looked bigger, sturdier and more confident) right on the road as we were returning to the highway after being stopped by the in-park road construction.

The scenery is especially good this year with the spring rains providing lush green grass to add color to the views. The road is in rough shape the first four miles or so, but good after that.

The first night I spent quite some time driving around the south unit, walking some short trails and snapping pictures of buffalo, wild horses and breath taking views. The next morning I took the hike out to the petrified forest, it was about 5 miles round trip. It was pretty but not something I would do every time I head back. I had no idea that the north unit was a little over an hour away from the south unit, but I am so glad I made the drive. There is a self guided nature hike that is only 0.8 miles but if you continue on takes you in roughly a 6 mile loop. The long hike takes you from the bottom of the canyon to the top of the ridge and over to the river bend lookout.

Theodore Roosevelt lost his wife and mother on the same day - Valentine's Day - and came to the Medora ranch to recover.

Theodore Roosevelt once lived there and much of the town is dedicated to his memory.In addition, there is a musical on the history of the area and nationally recognized entertainers. This show is not to be missed. One of the more interesting things on the hill near the amphitheater is the cemetery that has some very unique and in some cases humorous epithets.

We visited during the spring so we got to see baby bison. Don't miss the north unit of the park this is where the cannon ball concretions are.

We saw quite a bit of wildlife: many bison, several long-horn steer, several deer, prairie dogs, along with a small herd of wild horses in the park's South Unit the next morning. We stayed overnight in Watford City before heading to the South Unit the next morning. The South Unit was equally beautiful, yet a bit different, offering beautiful views of the Little Missouri River.

We arrived late at night, so didn't know what to expect. Got up at sunrise and just, Wow! Great scenery -it was like the Badlands NP but a bit greener. At Custer SP we'd only seen a solitary bison here and there(and we tried 3x). We'd really wanted to see a herd. As we came around a bend in the road of the scenic loop drive at TRNP our dream came true- we were in the middle of a herd! The nature center was a treat too. We went here ""by accident"" as we'd been driving and driving and couldn't find any hotels along highway 94. A really remote part of the country!

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"If you can get through the first part as the tourist trap of Medora, you get to the entrance to the park. THEN it's lots of beautiful scenery, and walking paths and photo ops. THEN we were at a buffalo crossing. Of course, everyone is stopped, even some idiot pre teen gets out of the car right in front of a buffalo, so his mom can take a picture of him! I didn't want to stay and watch the rest of THAT story. But, moving on, Buffalo were crossing the highway, and did get some pictures from the safety of the car. Back into the town of Medora, there are places to eat. But, I would just get a snack if you can't wait and go to Dickinson, ND instead. High priced stuff and really no better than fast food places for a lot less. Didn't attend the musical.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,My wife and I took a great western driving vacation and found TRNP had the most impressive herds of Bison of the lot! We also saw what seemed like thousands of Prairie Dogs. We took a fascinating hike in a petrified forest and really enjoyed the scenic drive of the Southern Unit near sunset. The next time we go we are going to go to the Northern Unit - 60 miles to the North of Medora.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"A great park to visit....even by car. The only ""crowds"" gather when a herd of Buffalo appears along the road. Otherwise,, even on a beautiful day, you seem almost totally alone to take in great scenery. While the North and South Units are similar, see both. While we only saw herds of Buffalo and fields of Prairie Dogs, other wild animals do occasionally make an appearance, if you're patient and observant. Also, while the park is similar to the Badlands of South Dakota, it has a natural beauty all its own. If you stay in Medora, the North Unit is about 85 miles north, but well worth the drive. The South Unit is right in Medora. Except for a few bathrooms, there is no other facilities available in the parks. By all means, stop at the Ranger Stations for information. We are not campers, but we still really enjoyed the park.","September 5, 2013",Where the Buffalo really roam!,7,"Aldie, Virginia",5

I've been to a lot of the bigger national parks like Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Yosemite etc. which have millions of visitors and tons of ""programs"". TR is not like those parks. There is an unspoiled beauty, a much less ""organized, developed feel"" to it and I love that about it. I truly hope the energy development and ""fracking"" in the area doesn't take over.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"On a summer trip across the country we decided to travel through North Dakota since we had never been there. We had only recently heard of this National Park and decided to make a brief stop in the South Unit of the park. We ended up spending a few hours, and wish we could have stayed much longer. We first stopped in the Painted Canyon area, which was exceptionally beautiful! There is a nice trail that runs along the upper rim that overlooks the badlands, which were rich with various hues of red. Unlike the South Dakota Badlands, you can't walk within the rock formations, but the formations are still stunning to see from the trail. A visitor center is also in this portion of the park. Driving a little further down the road we entered the 36-mile scenic loop drive with the hope of seeing some wildlife, but we were too limited in our time to drive very far into this portion. We were pulling a camper, and there are only a few areas where you can turn around if you aren't going to visit the entire loop. We did get to see some praire dogs, but you have to drive further in the park to see the bison. If you plan on traveling in North Dakota, take the time to visit this hidden gem. It would be worth a visit to this area just to see this beautiful park!","August 13, 2013",A North Dakota Surprise,62,"Erie, Pennsylvania",5

We had stopped at the Medora visitor center and looked at the displays. I had spoken with a Park Ranger about needing to get back home, but wanted to see as much of the park as we could. She mentioned driving the route to the Wind Canyon and then if we wanted to, we could turn around and come back. (The road was a nice two lane, paved road.) We got out at a couple of the pull offs to get a better view of the scenery. We were enjoying the park so much that we went ahead and finished the entire loop. We saw wild horses, deer, and buffalo. A small herd of buffalo moms and babies were about five feet away from our vehicle. The kids thought it was very exciting.

Also, we saw several different herds of beautiful, healthy-looking wild horses and colts grazing near the road, climbing the hills, and grazing in meadows. Also saw deer and wildflowers, thus a total success.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We arrived midday from Fargo, and drove around the scenic loop of the South Unit near Medora. The scenery was phenomenal, indescribable. We saw wild horses (and took videos for our granddaughter). We were hoping to see bison, but apparently just missed them a couple of times according to fellow travelers we spoke with. Then, on the last part of the loop, we came upon a herd of perhaps 25 bison on both sides of the road. We took photos and video of them grazing, crossing the road, a calf nursing from her mother, etc. A bull jumped over a guardrail and crossed the road just in front of our car (perhaps five feet away)!Next day, we went to a ranger program at the Painted Canyon visitor's center. Then we drove to the North Unit. It's quite far away, and the road you have to take has a lot of truck traffic (from the oil development going on) and road work, but a speed limit of 65 other than in work areas. It is far enough that going there requires serious commitment. I urge people to go there. The South Unit is far less visited than better known parks such as Yellowstone or Yosemite, and the North Unit is far less visited than the South Unit. If anything, the landscape is even more spectacular in the North. We saw some wild horses and some wild longhorn cattle. Then we did a short hike to a prairie dog town. Then we drove back out, through the magnificent landscape.","August 3, 2013",A wonderful park that too few know about,72,New York,5

TRNP has the beauty of the Dakota Badlands & the excitement of Yosemite & Yellowstone with its wildlife, & fascinating history of how Theorodore Roosevelt came to love this land & purchase some of the property that has become TRNP. TRNP has 3 separate sections-the South Unit, accessed in Medora, ND is the largest. We drove the 36 mile scenic road one day taking in the scenery, several of the hiking trails, but not a lot of wildlife. We decided to drive TRNP the next early morning & were blessed with up close & personal experiences with bison, wild horses, & longhorn sheep. But, do not get out of your vehicle! Obey the signs about contact with wildlife. There are multiple prairie dog towns in the park-they are fun to watch but don't think about taking one home for a pet. We didn't visit the other TRNP units, Elkhorn & North-Elkhorn requires high clearance vehicles-& from what we learned, not much to see except the foundation of the cabin TR had built. We decided not to travel to the North Unit since we were very happy with our experience in the South Unit.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I spent several days exploring the South Unit. On the first day, I arrived early on a Friday morning and was bid good morning by a group of wild horses. I parked on a turnout and proceeded to start the Upper Paddock/Upper Talkington loop hike (~15 mi). This loop took me through all kinds of terrain from stereotypical badlands, to a section or forest, and prairie. Besides some noise from the highway at one point, I did not see anyone else for about 6 hours (except for 3 men on horseback). I didn't see any bison, but two groups of wild horses ran right by me.On the second day, I drove the loop. Being a Saturday afternoon, the park was noticeably more crowded but empty enough that you could still be alone for a bit. I decided to start the loop up towards Peaceful Valley and was immediately greeted by a herd of bison coming down the road. It was a bit nerve-wracking to be completely surrounded by hundreds of large animals, but they didn't pay attention to the cars. Once they went by, I drove up to several overlooks, including Wind Canyon and Boicourt, with the latter being one of my favorite views in the entire park. To end the day, I drove down a gravel road to the Paddok Creek trailhead (just north of Peaceful Valley) and was surprised to find that the parking lot sat in the middle of a prairie dog town. Additionally, all of the bison from earlier had moved to a hill close by, and that was an interesting sight.","July 28, 2013",Tons of different views and wildlife,11,Washington,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"On our way to Yellowstone from Minneapolis we camped one night at Cottonwood Campground in the South Unit. We arrived around 4:00pm on a Friday and had at least 10 sites to pick from for our tent camper. There were more smaller sites available too. We went into Medora for a couple of hours, came back and played around the river by the campground, and then drove the south scenic loop. We almost had a head-on collision with a large bull bison coming around a corner (he was in our lane going the wrong direction ;-))! We saw herds of bison, some elk, prairie dogs and horses. Well worth the visit!","July 22, 2013",A great place to stop for a night!,4,"Chaska, Minnesota",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,We had read and heard about this park and when passing thru the area we made sure to stop. It's beautiful. Make sure to stop in the visitors center in medora to talk to a ranger. We also took the short free tour of Roosevelt's cabin which is just out the back door of the visitors center. They even let you go inside. The drive thru the park is beautiful. We came across many prairie dog towns and a few bison beards. We actually had to stop to let the bison cross the road. We didn't do much hiking as the day was vey hot. I would like to go back and see the park in another season. Don't skip this park if you are nearby.,"July 21, 2013",This is a must see National Park,59,"Chicago Heights, Illinois",5

Lots of animals to view, buffalo, deer, Wild Turkeys, etc. It does not have the touristy feel with lots of places begging for your money. The little town near by, Medora, has some restaurants and stores, etc. for those that like the touristy stuff. We just stayed out in the campground and enjoyed the quiet and peaceful beauty.

There's also an abundance of wild animals roaming the park, so make sure your camera is ready. We ran into bison, prairie dogs, elk, antelope, wild horses, and deer. I'd recommend during dusk or dinnertime- that's when it seems like many animals are walking around. Many trails to choose from- the Painted Canyon is pretty too. The campgrounds are great too!","July 20, 2013",Definitely make this stop! Lots of wild animals,16,"Groton, Connecticut",5

The charge was $10 per car and I would have paid $100 to see the south unit. We saw beautiful scenery and so many animals I lost count. At one point we were about 6 feet away from a bison. Of course, we were in our car. There were numerous wild horses as well. What a national treasure and so much less crowded than Yellowstone. I was disappointed in the north unit. First, it's a one-hour drive from the south unit and you have to battle oil trucks on a two-lane road all the way there. The scenery was nice, but it doesn't compare to the south unit. Unless you are a purist and have to see every part of national park I would not bother with the drive.","July 10, 2013",The South Unit is the best.,16,Evansville,5

Due to time, we visited only the South Unit. Painted Canyon in the morning (excellent views), lunch in Medora (mediocre at best) and golf at Bully Pulpit (this course is wonderful!!!) made for a great day. On day two, we drove and hiked many of the trails along the Loop Drive. Lots of bison, lots of nice views, lots of easy trails. Well worth the visit! As with most other remote and less-travelled national parks, just start at the visitor center, talk to the ever-so-nice rangers, and just get out there and explore. Get out of the car and hike around a bit. This was worth the trip fom Texas. Plus, we hit Devil's Tower (I prefer Bear Tipi as a name) and headed south to Custer State Park.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"At TRNP we decided to auto tour, hike, and ride the horses at the Peaceful Valley Ranch. The horses turned out to be the best part of our visit, a good way to see the badlands, and connect with the rugged terrain. We even spooked 3 male elk in velvet over the ridge. Horses already saddled, and the guides waiting, we saddled up quickly, and set out for a beautiful ride, even challenging ride, not for sissies. We car toured the overlooks, took many pictures which included feral horses, bison, pronghorn, prarie dogs, and other wildlife in a scenic backdrop of erroded rocks and rivers. Green as Ireland in June, colors bright and layered. Camping filled up in the evenings, but easily secured without reservations. CapRock Coulee hike was muddy yet not too strenuous in the north unit. No noise from drilling heard in either park when we there. Still felt like wilderness, boomtown and oil rigs not noticeable in the two units of the park. A definite destination, not just a stopover, and worthy of the three days we were there. Removed six ticks.","July 9, 2013",Wilderness in the oil boom.,9,Cheyenne,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I hadn't heard about this park prior to planning our vacation in the area, so we decided to stop. We visited the Painted Canyon one evening and found it beautiful and uncrowded. We hiked to the bottom of the canyon, which is a decent hike and good trail. Our daughter was excited to find clumps of bison fur and tons of tracks! We got to see the colorful formations up close, and see some interesting plants (cacti, flowers). The next day, we visited the main part of the park in Medora. It took a couple of hours to drive the scenic drive, but it was wonderful! We stopped and watched the antics of the prairie dogs, and then were treated to an up close look at wild horses (they were playing next to the road, and we had to wait for them to move before continuing!) We also saw numerous single bison, and then two large herds later on. We saw elk from a distance, and generally enjoyed the views of the colored and sculpted landscape. The visitor's center in Medora also has good information on the park.If you have kids, ask about their Junior Ranger program, which is available in many National Parks. My daughter completed some simple and quick activities and was rewarded by being ""sworn in"" as a Junior Ranger, complete with a shiny plastic badge. She was thrilled!

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"This is one of those savor the moment kinds of trips. For a $10 per carload entry fee, you can spend literally the entire day exploring and viewing spectacular scenery and wildlife. The main drive is a 36 mile loop that should take a minimum of two hours if you just drive it. More if you enjoy some of the relatively easy hiking trails that gets you off the main road. Regardless of how much time you actually spend, you're going to see some wonderful sights. It's going to be relatively slow going because there's tons of cars taking their time so it's best not to be in a hurry. It's not crowded in the Yellowstone crowded and there are plenty of turn-outs so it's extremely pleasant. You'll see tons of prairie dogs, hopefully a lot of buffalo (although we only saw two!), wild horses, and hopefully other critters. Even if you don't see a ton of animals, the scenery is worth the drive. If you have time, do the drive twice, especially if you can do it later in the afternoon.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We had been to Yellowstone, so did not think this park would top that for animals, but the hundreds of comical prairie dogs, large herds of insouciant buffalo, and beautiful, healthy-looking wild horse herds all made for a great experience in Roosevelt Park. The winding roads, slow drive, and uncrowded vistas are a treat. We saw herds of buffalo coming down in a cloud of dust from a high bluff, some grazing right by the road with their little calves, and some nonchalantly ambling across the lane. The wild horses are all colors and sizes, including their young colts, and seemed unimpressed by the slow moving car, so they did not run away but allowed you to look up close. We also saw deer grazing in the meadows, and several hundred prairie dog town with curious p-dog faces popping up like jack-in-the-boxes.

Bison, deer, Rocky Mountain sheep, wild horses, cottonwood trees all make great encounters on a hike or a drive. the park has two units. The South unit is boarderde by the town of Medora. A true wild west town where Teddy Roosevelt spent part of his life. It is a tourist town with lots of little shops and the Medora Musical at night in an outdoor amphitheater.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"By entering Theodore Roosevelt National Park at the South Unit, you have the opportunity to go on a very scenic 36 mile drive. Along the drive, you will certainly have the chance to see wild life, such as bison, wild horses, prairie dogs and elk. You can also take several hikes along the way. Most are on the short side, so plan on stopping and taking a walk along Ridgeline Trail (.6 mi), Coal Vein Trail (.8 mi), or Buck Hill, a short, yet very steep .2 mile trek to get a panoramic view of the Badlands. There is also Wild Canyon Trail, which is only .3 miles. By following this trail, you can get a great view of the river.

Teddy Roosevelt loves this area of North Dakota and it reflected heavily on his life afterwards. I clearly understand why. The North Dakota are beautiful in their own sense and this park at a minimum deserves at least one full day if not more. Get out of the car and walk the trails if you can, you will not be sorry. The park is also full of wildlife and has a healthy heard of Bison.

There was still lots to see from inside the car, and the trip was worth the experience. The scenes varied like the topography. We saw quite a lot of bison and wild horses. The scenic drive in the northern unit had several miles the kids actually rode on their bikes, which heightened their awareness of their surroundings and contributed to subsequent discussions. The southern unit scenic loop had sections the kids rode as well, when the rain stopped.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"TRNP is a ""sleeper"" of a National Park. Often overlooked by travelers on their way to Glacier NP or Yellowstone. I highly recommend spending a day to visit this beautiful National Park. If you get an early start you can see all three units. I recommend starting in the North Unit, then visiting the South Unit, followed by the Elkhorn Unit. North Unit:The entire scenic route in the North Unit is now open. The route is out and back the same way, which is great to revisit your favorite vistas. The roundtrip mileage is approx. 28 miles. Currently, the North Unit visitor center is only open on the weekends. The auto route into the park starts near the Little Missouri River and winds its way up into the hills. There are some amazing views at the end of the route at the Oxbow Overlook and along the way at the Riverbend Overlook. Past the Riverbend Overlook area you are atop the broad hill and its expansive view. I personally enjoyed the views along the lower elevations. The Caprock Coulee trail is worth taking. Interesting formations at Cannonball Concretions. Drive slowly and watch for bison, many which graze alongside the road. It is not uncommon for bison to cross the road. They can be dangerous, so don't get too close and do not startle them. I can not compare the North with the South unit; each are unique and beautiful.South Unit:Touring the South Unit was absolutely amazing. All sections of the road are now open. The scenic loop route is approx. 36 miles and takes you past some of our Country's most rugged landscapes. I thoroughly enjoyed hiking the Ridgeline Trail, a short, yet moderately difficult nature trail. The view atop Buck Hill gives one a 360 degree panorama of the entire region. It is the highest point in the South Unit. I encountered more bison in the South Unit than in the North Unit. I also recommend seeing the Boicourt Overlook.Elkhorn Ranch Unit:It is definitely worth the extra effort to get to the Elkhorn Unit, especially if you seek solitude. While you can find many areas in TRNP that offer peace, natural beauty, and quiet, the probability is high that you may experience the Elkhorn Ranch unit all to yourself (or your group!). Located approximately 35 miles north of Medora, most visitors just don't have time in their schedule to visit both the North and South Units, AND the Elkhorn Ranch Unit. The ""easiest"" way to get here is to travel on I-94 west from Medora and get off at Exit 10. Travel north on County Road 11 (on Google Map it is also denoted as 161st Ave. SW) and follow until you see the street sign for Westerheim Road. Follow the twists and turns of Westerheim. Then look for a left turn at an intersection for Belle Lake Road. Follow this to FH-2 where you will turn right. Follow this to the parking area of the undeveloped Elkhorn Unit. The trip length from I-94 takes about one hour. The entire route is unpaved; much is hard packed. The route meanders every possible direction as well up and over hills. FH-2 I think is the most challenging part of the route as it descends toward the Little Missouri River. The road here is softer and thus muddy when wet. Returning up the FH-2 is the challenge. Obviously, an AWD or 4WD vehicle is recommended; however, I made the trip out and back without incident in a front-wheel drive vehicle. Conditions were dry; and FH-2 had sections of deep ruts (softer, yet dry). Check with the park office at the South Unit before embarking on this trip. While the aforementioned route passes by beautiful vistas of farmland and the edges of the Badlands (the entire route is very scenic; however, not in the same awe as either the South or North units), please note you will see several oil well rigs, pads and sites. In fact, you may encounter several oilfield trucks and tankers driving at speeds that appear excessive. BE CAREFUL and drive defensively. The Elkhorn Ranch site is an approx. 0.5 to 0.75 mile hike in from the parking area. The NPS is keeping the site undeveloped to give one a sense how it looked when Teddy wandered around. You can see a few of the foundation stones of the buildings; there are a few information plaques. Nice views of the river and the surrounding hills. Fans of TR will love it here, as you walk in the footsteps of our ""conservation President."" If you seek solitude, there is a good chance you will find it at TR's Elkhorn Ranch site.","May 1, 2013","Rugged, Wild, Scenic, Quiet, Reflective...Put Theodore Roosevelt NP on your list of parks to visit",490,"Malvern, Pennsylvania",5

The park itself has great scenery and I would like to go back in the summer season to see it and camp out and go out on the horse trails they have. The camp site looks nice, with a fair bit of space between each tent, and lots of foliage to keep the summer sun off you. Its located next the river as well and we drove through, there were Bison roaming just on the outskirts. Lots of wildlife and lots to take in.","April 11, 2013",Just as good as the big names,47,"Keswick, United Kingdom",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Having been to about a dozen national parks I was skeptical that TRNP would have anything to offer. After all, you don't often think of North Dakota as a vacation destination. Boy, was I glad to proven wrong. The park is amazing! Wildlife is everywhere! Over the course of three days I spotted bison, prairie dogs, coyotes, wild turkeys, feral horses and even a prairie rattlesnake. There's countless miles of hiking trails for every experience level. Off-trail hiking and backpacking are also allowed if you're searching for solitude in the backcountry. If not, the park has one campground that's quiet and well-maintained. A bison herd would wander through every night around dinnertime. My only complaint was that the campground host blew me off when I asked for his help, but I won't fault the park for a single person's rudeness. This is a highly recommended hidden gem in the National Park Service.","February 21, 2013",Best Kept Secret in the NPS,32,"Mesa, Arizona",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Beautiful landscapes, abundant wildlife, great facilities and staff. Perhaps the best part was how serene and quiet it was, not nearly as crowded as some National Parks. Give yourself a good two hours minimum to do the scenic loop in the southern unit of the park. There are lots of overlooks and short hikes to do along the way. Dusk is a great time to visit because more animals come out (including TONS of bison) and the dramatic light makes the painted canyons even more beautiful.","November 5, 2012",Hidden Gem of a National Park,26,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We spent 2 days in the off season exploring this wonderful park. The trails in the south and north units were perfect opportunities to get close to nature and the amazing landscape. Just watch out for buffalo ""chips"" which are abundant. The trail to the prairie dog village in the north unit was particularly fun, as the dogs would bark at us. We saw a lot of wildlife - from antelope to buffalo to bighorn sheep. There is an advantage to going off season. And the stars at night will take your breath away. I rank this as one of my top 10 National Parks, and I've been to most of them. Well worth any trip.","October 26, 2012",Peaceful,9,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"Great non crowded National Park. We went counter clockwise on the 36 mile loop road. We saw two heards of wild horses on the outside of the loop between miles 7-16. You have to look carefully to find the horses. One herd was about 1000 yards off. We were also stopped by two herds of buffalos on the park road. You will be close enough to the buffalo that you can smell them, they stink.","October 24, 2012",Wild Horses and Buffalos,71,Massachusetts,5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"On the recommendation of North Dakota friends, my wife, one adult daughter and myself made an itinerary change to visit this park on our driving trip from Western New York to Montana. We did not have time to spend more than 3 hours driving through the park but it was totally worth it. The information center helped us plan our time there. The painted canyon badland scenes were stunning; the rock formations and colors impressed at every turn in the road. As easterners, we loved being stopped by a herd of unhurried bison letting us take countless photos. Anyone having seen South Dakota's badlands need not assume that this North Dakota park is the same. For us, each was unique. Maybe because of the time of year, there was no crowding. Even after seeing other great parks in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota, we are grateful for what Teddy Roosevelt did to preserve this area. It is still a memorable highlight of our western trip.","October 17, 2012","Surprising, memorable and highly recommended",14,"Le Roy, New York",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"You're apt to have your first encounters with bison and prairie dogs here. The park is a gentle form of the Badlands further south. Medora, North Dakota, is where you enter the park. Medora in itself is interesting as it's the most authentic western town I've seen on my trip out west. It has many original buildings and is full of history about the president. In case you don't know it, Teddy Roosevelt lived and worked here and said his experiences here made him into the strong conservationist he was. The rangers, as always, are very knowledgeable and sometimes lead night hikes off trail. A tip about visiting the national parks if you're 62 or older: get the Senior Pass for a once-in-a-lifetime charge of $10. It gets you, your car, and passengers into the parks free and gets you a 50% discount on camping fees.

This year we decided to visit the north unit. Several reviewers mentioned that it is not as spectacular or as heavily visited as the south unit, and that is true. But it has its own beauty, and we prefer to get away from the crowds when we can. Our visit did not disappoint us, and we had ample opportunities to stop, get out of the car and walk around.

The South Unit seems bigger with more options available for things to do, but the North Unit seemed less crowded when I went previously. Good have just been the weekends though. We love this park for a variety of reasons - fairly predictable weather, easy access to showers, restaurants and other entertainment, hiking trails, and mostly the WILDLIFE and lots of it. In our most recent trip we saw wild buffalo, wild horses, coyote, foxes, prairie dog, elk, mule deer, pronghorn, bull snakes, turkey and plenty of beautiful prairie flowers. Some of it was seen on our hikes and some on our sunrise and sunset drives. Some people say it‚Äôs worth a ""Stop"" and I would disagree.

My husband and I are national park ""buffs"" with a goal of visiting at least all the national parks. (We know there are just too many national monuments, etc. to get to all those.) Anyhow, while probably not one of our favorite parks, it is certainly worth seeing if only for the buffalo. We were fortunate enough to be right there when a herd was crossing the loop road. As a family we hiked the Coal Vein Trail (approximately one mile), but it was just too hot for my husband and I to do more. However, my daughter and son-in-law did do a longer trail. The kids chose to go back into Medora with us while their parents were hiking even though the kids usually like to hike. Our main concern was having enough water. Even though we thought we had brought enough water, we used up a lot of it on the little hike. We were afraid if too many people went on the longer hike, the water would run out. So, my advice is to take more water than you think you can possibly drink and then add some.","July 24, 2012",Worth Visiting,85,"Rochester, Michigan",3

I enjoy seeing all the National Parks/National Monuments/National Historic Sites when I travel. I also like to see badland scenery and wildlife. Finally, I was excited to see the area where Teddy Roosevelt lived, hunted and ranched. My husband and I drove the 36 mile loop road through the park three different times, late afternoon/evening and enjoyed it very much. We always saw wildlife and the shadows from the setting sun really set off the badland scenery. We also walked one of the nature trails. I loved seeing the bison and I actually felt a little emotional seeing them at first and realizing how when Teddy Roosevelt was here in the late 1800's, the bison had been almost killed off, with few to be found. But here as elsewhere, they are now protected and there is a good sized herd at the park. The bison do not seem to be scared of cars as they hang around near or cross the road and did not run off when we stopped to look at them. I especially liked seeing the calves and watching them frolic and run around. The wild horses were a real treat and we were able to see a number of them as well. Lots of foals and the horses were just beautiful. We saw a few deer, but I was surprised that we only saw two antelope and no elk during our three drives. I would recommend stopping at the picnic area as it is a shady and pleasant place to take a break. We came here a few times to watch for birds as I am a birding fanatic and there were a number flitting around the trees here. The visitor center is also very nice and I loved seeing Teddy Roosevelt's cabin out back. The inside of the cabin can only be viewed with a tour from the park ranger. Does not take long to see this furnished and adorable residence. One of the great things about this park when we were here was the solitude and lack of visitors. Most of the time we saw few or no visitors. The park is right next to Medora, so if you are staying in the town, there is very easy access. We only visited the south unit because much of the north unit was closed due to road issues while we were there. Don't miss this wonderful park. You will see beautiful badland country and wildlife!","July 8, 2012",Wonderful Park!,564,"Modesto, California",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I thought TRNP was sorta a cross between the SD Badlands terrrain and the forests of the Black Hills; very scenic, wild and rugged. Being one of the least visited national parks means it's not as touristy (without the maddening crowds you can get down south dakota way). TRNP consists of the South Unit (by Medora) and a separate less visited North Unit. Both units have visitor center/museums at their entrances. There are two primative campgrounds inside the parks, Cottonwood in the South and Juniper in the North. Guided trail rides are available in the summer. The South Unit's 36-mile loop drive has plenty of pull-offs to park and enjoy the views. Coal Vein and Buck Hill are two short and 'fairly' easy (but uphill) hiking trails. We saw bison, prairie dogs, wild horses, antelope, prairie dogs, wild turkeys, vultures, prairie dogs, etc. The North Unit also has a herd of long-horn cattle. The North Unit is about a 50 mile drive north of I-94 on US 85 from Belfield. (Be aware - this area of North Dakota is booming with oil workers and the traffic can make the drive to the North Unit a challenge. Several locals warned us there's frequent head-on collisions on US85 between Belfield and Williston when idiot drivers think they have enough time to pass slow-moving oil trucks in no-passing zones.) The North Unit seemed more rugged & isolated then the South Unit. Unfortunately the only road in the North Unit is permanently closed after 6 miles due to road deterioration. We went hiking on a trail close to where the road is closed and came across a petrified log laying on the ground; with the remaining tree trunk sticking out of a cliff about 12 feet up? Later a park ranger verified that's what it was. Especially interesting was the Cannon Ball Concretions formations - large round rock spheres built up by deposits of minerals around a clay or shale core. There are several balls laying on the ground with more jutting out of the cliff above waiting for erosion to free them.","June 24, 2012","Enjoyed the Parks' Scenery, Wildlife & Non-crowded Atmosphere",647,Iowa,4

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My brother and I camped in the South Unit for 4 days. We saw Bison, wild horses, prairie dogs, and even a snake. We did the 36 mile scenic loop and petrified forest hike. Well worth it. We went to the North Unit one day. Very little wildlife and the road was closed due to it being washed out. The visitor's center has a nice museum and video in the South Unit. The area is booming due to oil, but oil workers are not permitted to camp for long at the park. We did not visit Medora because most of the activities are starting in June.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"You start to understand the beauty of the south unit of the Roosevelt National Park about ten miles out from the exit, when the nondescript flat landscape that has grace I-94 for miles gives way to the canyons and spires of the Badlands. But the hidden gem here might be the visitors center itself, located on the edge of Medora. Here, you get an understanding of Roosevelt's reasons for leaving behind New York City to find himself over a thousand miles away. If you are able to make your way back into the park, you can almost sense the kind of peace that would make him stay as long as he did.

After about the third turn in the road we spotted a coyote stalking prairie dogs and deer in a meadow while the buffalo watched him. It was a moment of sheer joy for the three of us. Boys loved getting out and watching the prairie dogs bark and wiggle their tails at us in warning. It was well worth the time and a beautiful, lonely place to stretch our legs and get some fresh air.","April 24, 2012",Even great for a short off-season stop off the highway,18,"Seattle, Washington, United States",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The 3rd time was the charm for us visiting this beautiful national park. We have seen wild horses in the distance before, but this time we saw them up close. We went two days in a row and were lucky both days to see these beautiful animals. We saw and studied different bands, watching their behavior with each other. The stallions were very protective of their mares and babies. We would never get out and disturb them; we just park safely off the road and then just watch. Don‚Äôt be in a hurry when you go through the park. Animals may be just around the bend standing in the road or on the side of the road. The landscapes are beautiful & the colors change depending on the time of day. Bring your camera! There were Bison cows and calves, prairie dogs, & mule deer. And be sure to visit the visitor center. Inside there is a model of the Teddy Roosevelt‚Äôs Elkhorn Ranch house that was made & donated by Stanley Reetz a local artist. The year before we went through the North Unit ‚Äì very nice and quiet.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"My wife and I spent our one year wedding anniversary in Medora and before we visited I really didn‚Äôt think that the National Park was going to be thrilling and fun, but I sit corrected. Our time in TRNP was some of the most fun we had in Medora and it has sparked an interest in National Parks within me. There are tons of hiking trails, mane that you can cover in an hour or so. My wife and I hiked three trails during our day in the park and each trail was distinctly its own. We encountered prairie dogs, bison, wild horses, and saw a dead snake (which is good because my wife isn‚Äôt fond of living snakes). I would suggest including this in your plans of the Medora area and to spend at least three hours there. The natural beauty of the loop is like nothing else in North Dakota.

Make sure that you ask the real rangers, some of them are interns and they make a lot of mistakes. Also, the lady at the Medora coffee shop is very knowledgeable and she makes good coffee too. These trails are not all appropriate for kids--be aware of that ahead of time--we did not realize how steep some of the trails were.When we were in the park, a herd of buffalo walked right in front of our car, which is a little scary in addition to being awesome!Other than that, it is an easy drive and you can get out for the trails if you desire.

I also saw wild horses and buffalo. Make sure you get out at some of the overlooks, especially so you can get a good look at the river. Also, try to take a ranger tour of the Teddy Roosevelt's Maltese Cross cabin. It was really interesting and informative.I decided not to camp in the park because there weren't too many other people around, but the sites looked nice.

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I visited this park 4 times over the last few years, and I discover something new each visit. There are 3 sections to this park, the South Unit, the North Unit up by Watford City, and Elkhorn Ranch located halfway between the two. Most of my time is spent in the South Unit, where there is an abundance of wildlife. The 36-mile drive through the park has plenty of pull-offs along the way for you to park and enjoy the view. There are also some short hiking trails along the drive, as well as longer ones. I highly recommend seeing the Petrified Forest up in the northwest corner of the park. There is a much shorter trail towards it from outside the park; you can get a map to the trailhead at the visitor's center. While you're there, get a map to Elkhorn Ranch as well. This marks the area where Theodore Roosevelt built his ranch decades ago. There are no buildings, but informational signs explaining the layout of the ranch, as well as an awesome view of the countryside. The North Unit is smaller, but maybe more beautiful than the South Unit. TRNP is one of the least visited parks, so you have most of your vacation to yourself.","November 11, 2011",May be my favorite spot in ND!,286,"Silverdale, Washington",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I always figured that ND would be one of those states that I would never visit. After camping for two nights at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, I want to go back. We hiked out to the petrified forest, which is the third largest collection of petrified tree in the US. I would highly recommend it. We also drove the wildlife loop and saw what looked like the entire herd of bison (the ranger said that the herd is 350 head) crossing the road. We also wild horses and prairie dogs. In the evenings, there are ranger programs in the amphitheater.For those traveling with children, I would highly suggest requesting a family pack from the visitor-station. It contained binoculars, a bird guide, a scat guide, and a hand lens. Our son sat at our campsite and used the guide to identify birds nearby. He also determined that a bull frog had left some scat outside our tent. The family pack made the trip a lot more fun for all of us. Also, if you haven't participated in the National Parks Junior Ranger program, I would highly suggest inquiring about that as well.","August 16, 2011",An enjoyable way to visit ND,9,"Denver, Colorado",5

Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"I had never heard of Theodore Roosevelt before and was expecting it to resemble the rest of the Midwest: flat, rolling plains and, at times, blustery winds. While the winds were still blustery, the terrain was far from flat; it was broken and colorful, with strange rock formations jutting up and massive buttes arrayed in splashes of yellow, orange, and red. In short, it was exactly what you would picture the Wild West looking like. There is a small fee to enter the park ($10 per vehicle per week, plus other rates depending on how long you wanted to stay), but the 24-mile loop was easily driven and quite scenic. The ranger at the gate told us that the South Unit (in Medora, ND) had around 350 head of bison. Still, I didn't really expect to see any. We drove for about 30 minutes before we encountered any wildlife (not counting prairie dogs - they're everywhere), but the experience was unforgettable! Feral horse herds walked right up to the car, and pretty soon we were surrounded by herds of bison, so close you could reach out and touch them! It was fabulous! There were a number of hiking trails that wound through the park, as well, that afford a more intimate view of the scenery and wildlife. I'm not sure when the best time of day is to experience the park, but we went close to evening, around 7pm MDT.If you're driving west on I-94 (from Bismarck), be sure to drop by the Painted Canyon visitor center (exit 32), and whet your sightseeing appetite with a beautiful overlook of the Badlands. You might also consider hiking the 1-mile Painted Canyon loop trail (not too strenuous: young kids and parents were hiking it without any trouble).The town of Medora, which you will need to drive through in order to reach the park, is quite amenable to tourist needs. There's plenty of restaurants, museums, Wild West attractions, gift shops, restrooms, historical sites, and lodging in the quaint little town. For about $30 a person, you can even watch a live musical (the Medora Musical), which starts at 8:30pm.All in all, it far exceeded my expectations. Like me, North Dakota may not be your first thought when you think of the Wild West, but, nevertheless, the Wild West lives on at Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Teddy would be so proud!","June 21, 2011",Experience the Wild West,25,"Conway, Arkansas",5
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"The Badlands are absolutely stunning, and this park has amazing views throughout. Start at the Painted Canyon Visitors Center on I-94 - not only are the views spectacular (the light was great in late afternoon when we were there), but there are 5 bison who apparently hang out in and around the parking lot regularly.The park has two ""units,"" south and north. I only visited the south; the north has some different wildlife (longhorn cattle and bighorn sheep), but they are also more elusive.The Visitors Center in Medora is worth it to learn about the impact that Teddy Roosevelt had on the area (and to see a cabin he lived in), and the ranger on duty was helpful in relaying visitor information regarding where animals are likely to be found. The rest of the park is basically a 36-mile paved driving loop and a handful of trails (four of which are under one mile, but only one, the Coal Vein Trail, is not described as ""strenuous"". The Wind Canyon Trail is beautiful, and there are places to stop and sit for people who may not be able to handle the hill). During the morning, we saw only a few bison, but two were literally within feet of our vehicle. The prairie dog towns did not disappoint - very close to the road and very active. Saw a handful of pronghorn antelopes, but none close enough for pictures. Once the sun came out, the Badlands were amazing, so the drive was worth it just for that.The best wildlife viewing was definitely at dusk - a herd of bison; small herds of elk, white-tailed deer, and mule deer; wild horses close to the road.The park is not Glacier or Yellowstone - it won't keep you busy for days and days, and the terrain (though gorgeous) doesn't have the variety. There are a few longer trails, but all are one-way, which could be difficult for pick up (and a portion of the Maah Daah Hey Trail runs through both portions of the park). You can stay in Medora and have easy access to the park (but reserve well in advance), and there are a couple of other things to do in Medora - this is not a week vacation, but a well-spent three days or so.","June 6, 2011",Great for wildlife viewing & for scenic Badlands,124,"Wilmington, Delaware",4
Theodore Roosevelt National Park,"We visited the park in summer and it was peaceful and quiet, whether you have small kids or not the prairie dogs are great, our kids from 7-18 loved them, we got up really close with Bison and thoroughly enjoyed our visit, yes it's out of the way, but well worth visiting, the Roosevelt Cabin added to the interest value and made for a really good day.","May 4, 2011",Worth the trip,33,"Brussels, Belgium",5
