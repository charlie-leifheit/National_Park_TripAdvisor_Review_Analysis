Rocky Mountains,"My wife and I drove from Boulder to Estate Park and then through the Rocky Mountain National Park recently. There were many impressive scenes. As we drove higher and higher (up above the tree line at about 11,000 feet), the road stopped having a rail along the right side of the road, and if your car went a foot or two off the road to the right, you would tumble down the mountain to your death. It was pretty scary at times. I think it was the high point at the Alpine Lodge in the middle and we stopped, along with many others. The restaurant was nice and they had many great gifts at the gift shop. One of the problems was that we were told to drink a lot of water to avoid the altitude sickness and we had to go to the bathroom a lot and many of the ""bathrooms"" in the park were holes in the ground which smelled terrible. We went by the Continental Divide where the water to the east flowed east and the water to the west flowed west. I was disappointed in that many other mountain scenes I have seem were more beautiful.","October 7, 2019",Rocky Mountain National Park,168,"Cincinnati, Ohio",4
Rocky Mountains,"My wife, two year old son, and I live in Denver but play in the mountains. We've lived here for five years and are still exploring the Rockies almost every weekend. Estes Park is the Eastern entrance into the Park while Grand Lake is the Western entrance. The best hikes in my opinion are off the Estes side, but if you want the best chance to see moose then go to the Grand Lake side. Outside the RMNP, you can drive west down I-70 or take 285 into the mountains. Mt. Bierstadt is the closest 14er to Denver and probably the most crowded because of it's proximity. Grays & Torreys (14ers) are further west and offer amazing 360 views. I know everyone, including myself, want to climb the 14ers, but don't forget there are hundreds of 13ers out there that offer the same breathtaking views and with less crowded trails. The Rockies are an amazing playground and offer something for everyone. Don't be afraid to go and explore!","October 3, 2019","Best playground in our ""backyard""",2,"Denver, Colorado",5
Rocky Mountains,"this is a must see for everyone in their lifetime. I have been 4 times now and could go back every year. It's a different experience each time. I always thought I was a beach girl, but the mountains have definitely stolen a piece of my heart. ","September 25, 2019",Must See!,4,Ohio,5
Rocky Mountains,"The Rockies are always spectacular, especially this time of year. The Aspens are starting to turn yellow and the animals start to migrate down for the winter, so we saw lots of elk today. The skies are just a incredible shade of blue and the air is crisp and clean. It’s a place everyone should visit at least once and bring your kids. I recommend fall because the temp is just right for hiking, biking and a campfire at night. The camping is great in this area and it’s close to other great parks too.","September 21, 2019",Spectacular vistas,3,"Asheville, North Carolina",5
Rocky Mountains,"I cannot say enough about this park. We stayed in grand lake and visited 3 times in 4 days! If you are there longer than a day, go ahead and get the week pass. The elk and moose viewing were amazing. We will return next year!","September 21, 2019",Beautiful scenery!,1,,5

Rocky Mountains,"This is a beautiful park to visit, justifiably famous for its mountain scenery.Whilst you could get an overview of the park in a single day, better to plan for two or more, especially if you want to enjoy some hiking.Good to start with a drive up to the alpine visitor centre and to the highest point of the park at 12,000 feet. Couple of short (breathless) walks available close by to admire the ice capped tops of a number of mountains.If you're feeling adventurous drive up on the single track one way original Fall River road. Not for the fainthearted with plenty of twists and turns and sheer drops but the best for scenery.The visitor centre can help you decide best places to visit depending on your interests. Be warned if you want to visit the super popular Bear Lake and Glacier Gorge area in the middle of the park you need to aim to arrive by 8am to nab a parking spot or perhaps 9 if you're happy to do the park and ride, depending on the time if year. This visitor centre (there are several more in different parts of the park) also has an excellent gift shop and cafe. IMO Bear Lake is a great spot as there are shortish hikes that are not too steep or difficult to a number of beautiful lakes. You can plot your own path to take in around a half dozen, plus some small falls in a loop of around 9 miles plus. However, you definitely won't be alone! If you can't get to this area, don't worry too much though as there are so many other hiking options. We stayed in Boulder, which is a great small city but as we spent most of our time in and around the park we wish we'd stayed in Estes Park and saved an hours drive each way. Estes Park also has more of an informal holiday vibe with a cheaper choice of eateries.If you are in Boulder though make sure you enter or return from the park at least once on the more scenic, but slightly slower route 7.We had a great couple days in the park with no rain, but remember it is much chillier in the park with the higher altitudes. Our only slight disappointment was that we didn't see much wildlife: a few deer, elks and marmot.","September 16, 2019","Beautiful, scenic path with great hiking",546,"Chichester, United Kingdom",5

We had a wonderful two hours driving the Trail Road stopping periodically to stop to take photos. Every bend in the road gave yet another marvellous view. We stopped at a station on route for a bite to eat, Situated at over 11 thousand feet, it fair took my breath away in more ways than I would have expected.

You should definitely bring a jacket even on a sweltering day because it is cool at the top.

Rocky Mountains,Very scenic. The drive up was beautiful. Have patience. The road is narrow and people want to enjoy the view. There are pull-offs if they are not full which they often are since they are small and it is busy. There are three routes to take of different length so beware you don't end up going too far and driving for 5 hours instead of the three you intended. We stopped at the Alpine visitor center and then returned the same way we had come. If you like to hike there are PLENTY of trails to do so. The only major problem was that at one point there was a herd of elk right beside the road on both sides and cars were pulled over (not a pull over spot) and people were out taking pictures and trying to get as close as they could. This caused a traffic jam and made it hard to get through and to see the wildlife and get our own pictures.

Rocky Mountains,"We travelled from Denver to Estes and Rocky Mountains for the day. It was a wonderful drive on Trail Ridge Road. Road was single lane both ways but seemed to be plenty of driving room, and they did have many block edging along outter side.The views were amazing. Many places to stop along the route to the top, but lack of parking made many impossible to see. So, they need more parking for sure at these pull offs, and better signage to match the map. The visitor center cirlced all the stops we had to be sure to stop at, however we would drive by and go was that it? As no signs.We drove up and stops a couple of times and came down in about 2 hours. Most of the time was waiting for the bathroom! As only outdoor bathrooms, and men/womens were the same.Beware that some of the pull overs you had to walk aways to get to the ""spot""... We saw many people with blue lips and struggling to breathe the higher we got. And I must admit I struggled at the 360 degree view one. Seemed uphill there and back! LOLOne key piece of advise at the entry gate (there are 2 of them)...One lane is cash only. How do you know which one? Good question. Once we got closer I noticed a little, I mean little, piece of paper in the window of the booth that said cash only. You could tell as cars went up they were not prepared to pay $30 cash. Cost is $30 per car... So just be aware or have cash on hand along with credit card.","July 6, 2019","Wonderful scenery on Trail Ridge Road, Go early as was crowded and limited parking",37,"Zimmerman, Minnesota",4

For those who like to hike, Bear Lake is a point on the mountain that you can drive up to and park your car and hike on the trail. However the drive up the mountain is not for the faint of heart. It requires patience, ability to drive slow, keep your eyes on the narrow road (not on the beautiful scenes around) and watch out for wildlife that may cross your path.

Devon told us of the creatures endemic to the area and we experienced more than one close observation of wildlife.

Rocky Mountains,"This was the highlight of our trip to Colorado. My husband and I are no experienced hikers but we definitely enjoyed this one. We like to include at least one hiking activity every time we go on a trip and I have RMNP on our top favorites. I liked that there weren't a lot of people when we went. They are busier in the summer for obvious reasons of course. The mountains is about 30-40 degrees colder so make sure you have layers on that you can easily take off when you get hot too. I had to unzip my jacket and take off my gloves multiple times because I was getting warm from walking although it was still very cold. We went through Estes Park and drove up to Bear Lake Trailhead. I do not remember the exact amount, but parking fee is $20-25.The hike was moderate up to Emerald Lake (passing through Bear Lake & Dream Lake). However, I don't suggest taking kids all the way to Emerald Lake because there are some parts of the hike that may be too dangerous for the little ones. We did go during winter (November) though so there was a lot of snow, thus some parts slippery and difficult to climb. Otherwise, very doable and the views were spectacular!

Rocky Mountains,"What a wonderful day! We looked at other Rocky tours during the planning stages, but they were shorter in duration, and some included other segments such as sightseeing in downtown Denver, and many were cheaper. In the end we said to ourselves: ""We want the total day's focus to be on the Rockies"", so we forked out on this particular excursion.While we have no knowkedge of alternative tours, we made an excellent choice here. Time flew, and we had a full day of the Rockies in all their splendor. Tour guide Kyle, a mountaineer, knew the roads like the back of his hand, and the 10 of us on the comfy and powerful minibus got an experience worth every cent. The views were frankly breathtaking, we got good looks at deer, elk, piker, and birdlife, and the majesty of the snowy mountain peaks, even the steep rocky snow-free ranges, was, for us folk from dry, flat old Australia deeply moving.Kyle drive well on often-iced roads, spoke with knowledge, experience, appreciation of his environment, and humor, and the camaraderie between him, the tour group, and within the tour group made for an unforgettable day.

Beautiful drive, and a lot to see. We have taken so many pictures that are calendar worthy, it is hard to not get a good shot while you are there if you are into photography, into wildlife? As I mentioned, there is not a time we have gone that we have not seen wildlife. Large herds of Bull Elks in the spring growing their racks laying in the first large meadow you come to when entering the park from Estes Park. There is a pull off with a ranger station here with a few watering holes. This pull off has most often been manned by at least one, if not more, very knowledgeable park rangers who are very excited to share their knowledge. Spring leads to summer and the rangers are at that same spot to stop traffic for the Mountain Sheep when they come to drink, twice a day, which you can witness. This meadow bursts with activity throughout the year as you head into fall with Elk rutting and collecting their harems. We have even been lucky enough to see a moose, fox, coyote, deer and many, many, many birds. As you travel up the road from the Estes entrance you will come upon a pull of that leads you to Old Fall River Road, a one way dirt road that leads to the top of Trailridge, and is only open during good weather in the warmer months. Going up OFRR you will be able to see Chasm Falls, and take hair pin turns to the peak allowing you to look over the picturesque valley and get one of a kind camera shots!

Rocky Mountains,"Have you ever went to an amusement park, pay to get in so you can ride the roller coaster! So you travel long distances, pay to get in...Then you learn that you're not allowed to ride the roller coasters? And that was the main purpose of your visit!Well that is what sort of happen on our trip to this National Park...Our sole purpose was to hike to Bear, Dream, and Emerald lake. We proceeded down the road to the trailhead there only to be met by a long line of cars being turned away by Park Rangers and sheriff supposedly because there was no parking at that area. (We observed several cars exiting the area, but no cars were being allowed in) I have a background in law enforcement and security and I can appreciate the tasks of the officers..(having to repeat the same instructions to every vehicle), But being rude is not the answer, it would have been proper to inform us when entering the Park that there were these issues affecting their customers. I wonder how they would feel if they brought their families hundreds of miles to be turned away at the door? (reminds me of Chevy Chase in their trek to Walley World...National Lampoons vacation.) But I also know there are much better ways of handling this situation. Most poignantly, is to add additional parking at these sites. We were turned away with instructions to try again in an hour. Wow, not very good work NPS. We did gain entrance about 45 min later. And turned our lemon into lemonade.Also concerning other issues... my word, we people can be pigs...the bathrooms at the Bear Lake trailhead were awful...it was like someone exploded...feces everywhere. There were lines waiting to use the reminder of restrooms but 4 of them were locked and therefor un-usable. Why? It feels just like having empty parking spaces in the parking lot but not allowing people to enter and enjoy the park. This Park is there because the working americans pay taxes that allows the Park to even exist and for all to enjoy.Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of these issues.","October 22, 2018","Beautiful, but could be managed better By the National Park Service",7,"Lebanon, Kentucky",2

Rocky Mountains,":) my husband wanted to see Rocky Mountain in Denver CO, so we flied from NJ to Denver and we are glad we did.The views are dramatic. The air so clean and fresh, it's lovely experience. In our van (you can rent it right by airport) were 2 adults and 4 kids and everyone had great time. BTW have layers of clothing with you. On a top of a mountain is much cooler than down bellow, we went in a hot days of August, but on a high elevation we needed a light jacket.","September 18, 2018","Fresh air, we went to tundra, we went high and we went low and we saw a moose...",4,,5

Rocky Mountains,"Best places for photos: - Dream Lake (1.1 mile hike from Bear Lake parking lot to Dream Lake). One of the best places for a sunrise photo. Would be hard to shoot in the afternoon. The hike has some elevation gain, but overall fairly easy.- Bear Lake (265 yards from parking lot). Easy to get to, plus a fairly flat trail that makes a loop around this lake means this lake will look good anytime of day. Sunrise is great. If partly cloudy clouds at sunset, this spot could really deliver by shooting from the far end of the lake. Several groves of aspen trees above the lake make this a prime spot when leaves change color (usually sometime between Sept 14-24). Many other places to take photos in the park, but the two places above are the shots that you want. If you want a national park that has more epic locations per square mile, then go to the national parks in Utah instead.Note: the parking lot at Bear Lake (which is the end of the road) fills up quick. Shuttle busses do run to that location, but if you are taking great photos, you should be there early to catch the best rays, beat the crowd, get a good photo, and actually have a good parking spot.","September 16, 2018",Photo Tips for Rocky Mountain National Park,297,Alpine,4

Rocky Mountains,"If you like national parks then this is a place you must see. There are several entrances and visitors center. We came through Estes and, I believe, the southern entrance along trail ridge Road/Beaver Meadow Road. The visitors center had plenty of parking and was very nice. We proceeded to take the High Ridge route that was an 11 Mile one way road up to the visitors center that overlooks the entire valley. It is a long drive (11 miles at about 10-15 miles/hour) so it takes about 1-1.5 hour. There are a lot of switchbacks and steep roads with drop-off on the trail that you are driving. If you want to see the big view there is another (better road) faster route that I would suggest since we took it on the way back. The view from the Alpine visitors center was very nice although one building was under construction. Also, if you take a short hike from this visitors center (~300 yards) you can reach the 12000 foot sign/mark which has a very nice view.

RMNP is beautiful with so many vistas that take your breath away. The absence of trash a graffiti - there is none - speaks well of the visitors as well as the staff. The trails are clearly marked and there is enough information to choose the one you want based on distance and elevation gain Start at the Bear Lake Trailhead and choose the trail you want.

Since we didn’t, we left Estes Park the next morning & traveled north & then west on Trail Ridge Park. Views are breathtaking. We took a few short trails as well. The Tundra Trailhead was my favorite. My only complaint is once we exited out of RMNP on the west side it was either retrace our tracks or go down & around as there’s no other options. Pretty much 2 1/2 hours out of the way to get back to the eastern side. Although we traveled through some cool towns, I’d never have seen otherwise, it was still a lot of wasted driving to see what I could have coming in had I known. The lower eastern side is pretty & loved Lily Lake & Moose sighting. Otherwise there’s really not much else on the lower eastern side. Still glad we saw all of RMNP.

Rocky Mountains,"Absolutely breathtaking!! I am from the Midwest so our “hills” are nothing compared to these striking mountains!! Get the app, gypsy guide for your phone and USE IT!! My brother recommended it to me and I’m passing this along to you. It’s a beautiful drive and if you have the chance, take old Fall River road. It’s dirt and one way but just the experience itself is mind blowing!! Yes, you are pretty high up and no, there isn’t any road guards so hug those switchbacks when you’re going up. I don’t think I would take a car up it just because there is some deeper ruts and if it’s raining it’s possible you may get stuck but that’s just my opinion. It took us 12 hours to go through the park, stop at Grand Lake and eat lunch and then drove back through the opposite way. I recommend that, especially if you take old Fall River road up because you will miss many things on the way back down if you don’t. If you get the gypsy guide app, use it again as you come back the opposite way as the guide gives even more information you otherwise wouldn’t get. Oh and if you’re a wimp like me and succumb to altitude sickness( which I already was dealing with from a couple days before) wait a day or two before going into the park. Drink a ton of water( I get smart water or Gatorade, something with electrolytes in it) and some ibuprofen and they sell cans of oxygen at the store before you get into the park.

This time we found a nice spot overlooking the road just off the continental divide trail at Green Mountain to set-up our hammocks. The weather was beautiful and we spent close to 3 hours there. At one point we heard car stopping on the roadway below us so we looked over the edge and noticed a moose cow & calf across the road that was gathering a crowd. We had a great view from up above the road and took a few pics. If you're looking for moose pay close attention in the Kawuneeche Valley along the Colorado River; you'll also find several elk in the area and the elk come right into the Timber Creek campground for close pics.

He has really really good eyes, I could barely make it out. Saw a heard of elk off in the distance in another place but way far away. That was about it for the animals. The scenery is just wonderful and the temperature was inviting. I would not suggest eating at the restaurant in the park the food was way way overpriced and not all that great.

Rocky Mountains,"We spent a week on the western slopes of the National Park. Home base was rural Granby. Far less crowds than the Estes side---Beautiful vistas, animals galore, hiking trails everywhere, far less traffic, less touristy, quaint town of Grand Lake at the entrance to the park. If you're looking for animals, check out the Coyote Valley 5 miles inside the Grand Lake entrance. We saw plenty of moose and elk in that area. (Also the Holzwarth Historic site) Two nice waterfall hikes in the town of Grand Lake. Adams Fall is a short 1 mile--it does get crowded. The other spectacular one is Cascade Falls. It's a 7 mile out and back trip---but well worth the effort. Start early--this one gets crowded as well. Rangers suggested the Big Meadow trail for wildlife. We hooked it with Onahu and Green Mt. and turned it into an 8 mile loop. Saw no wildlife but plenty of moose poo---but the trip through the forest was great.A must is the Trail Ridge Road Byway from Grand Lake to Estes. Voted one of the most scenic routes in the USA. You'll travel well above the treeline into the tundra communities. Your driver must not get intimidated by the route----it is a challenge with no guardrails. Alpine Visitor Center at the top is worth a stop. Still lots of snow in late May. Several pullouts available for some great photo opps. There are 5 Visitor Centers spread throughout the park. Each with a story to tell. Last but not least---make it a point to go to Bear Lake area. Beautiful lake with mountain backdrop.

Rocky Mountains,"The Rocky Mountains are a vast chain of mountains which run from Canada to Mexico. The Great Continental Divide separating the drainage of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans runs along the ridgelines of its many ranges. Most people are familiar with the Front Range which rises in the west above the Denver area and includes fourteen thousand foot high summits like Pikes Peak (Colorado Springs), Mount Evans (Denver), and Longs Peak (Estes Park). Julia Ward Howe wrote America the Beautiful from the top of Pikes Peak. You may not burst in to song but you will definitely be inspired wherever you choose to visit. Your next step is to get out a map and narrow down the areas you want to see, as this is like trying to plan a trip to Kansas, Nebraska, or the Dakotas by looking up the Great Plains. Rocky Mountain National Park about two hours north of Denver is a good place to start and many people have in fact posted their reviews of that park here although that is only a small slice of the mountains. Hike, climb, drive, fish, raft, camp, ski- there is just so much to do it all depends on your interests.","June 20, 2018",Purple mountain majesty,906,Marion,5

Rocky Mountains,"Rocky Mountain National Park is located near Estes Park, along the Continental Divide in northern Colorado. In 2017 Rocky Mountain National Park was the fourth most visited national park with over 4.4 million visitors. The park is open year round and is famous for activities in all four seasons. At only 415 square miles it is not a large park but it is packed with beautiful scenery, rugged mountains carved by glaciers, forests, flowers and abundant wildlife. The entire park is designated as wilderness area and is managed as such. There is no lodging located within the park boundary. During the camping season there are five campgrounds and over 100 wilderness campsites. There are a handful of campsites that are open during the winter in Moraine Park Campground and back country winter camping is also available. The park has only about 100 miles of roads open to automobile traffic and the scenery from the roads is spectacular. Trail Ridge Road inside the park is the highest continuous paved auto road in the United States. There are over 300 miles of hiking trails that take you deep into the spectacular scenery you can only view from a distance in the car. There is something for everyone but Rocky Mountain National Park is truly a hiker's park. There is fishing, wildlife viewing, photography opportunities, park led activities, museums, and two stables for horseback riding. The park is known around the world for its technical climbing routes. There are five visitor centers with the Alpine Visitor Center being the highest visitor center in the National Park System. During the busy season interpretive rangers conduct many daytime activities as well as present evening campfire programs. Since the park allows you to experience its beauty from both the comfort of your car and the shoes on your feet it is a park for everyone. Rocky Mountain National Park is a very popular destination. 4.4 million visitors means you must plan your trip very carefully in order to avoid the crowds and enjoy the beauty of the park on your own terms. The Rocky Mountain National Park website is a very helpful resource for your planning activity. Visit the park in the off season to avoid huge crowds, including before mid-May and after the end of September. If you visit during the busy season of May through September then plan activities that start before 8:00 in the morning or start after 4:00 in the afternoon. If you are camping, make your campsite reservations 6 months in advance to ensure you have a campsite waiting for you. If you try to to find camp sites on the day of your arrival you will encounter problems. You will not find camping inside the park on the east side. Monday through Friday there may be a few sites available at Timber Creek Campground on the west side. You may have better luck with the National Forest Campgrounds or commercial campgrounds outside the park boundaries. If you try to enter the park after 8:00 in the morning during the busy season you may find it takes 30 to 45 minutes to get through the east side entrance stations. On the east side, the Glacier Gorge Trailhead Parking lot will be full by 6:30 in the morning because of the mountain climbers. The Bear Lake Trailhead parking lot will be full by 8:15 in the morning because of hikers. The road in the Bear Lake corridor willlikely be closed to vehicular traffic after the Free Shuttle Park and Ride parking lot fills, usually by 9:45 in the morning. If you have reservations for Glacier Basin Campground or a trail ride reservation at the Glacier Creek Stable you will be allowed to pass through the road closure and drive to the campground or stable. Motorcycles, bicycles, disabled placards and hikers will usually be allowed to go through the closure and proceed up the closed road. Traffic going over Trail Ridge Road becomes congested by 9:00 in the morning and becomes stop and go by 10:30 in the morning. The Alpine Visitor Center parking lot fills by 10:30 in the morning and park rangers will not let you enter the lot. Old Fall River Road does not open until the Fourth of July and there are length restrictions that will bar almost all but the smallest of RV’s from going up the one way road. And there will be a traffic jam at the top where Old Fall River Road empties into the Alpine Visitor Center parking lot. So this all sounds very inconvenient, and it is. Rocky Mountain National Park is very busy and very crowded. There are not enough roads and parking for all the cars that visit each day. There is a free shuttle system to move visitors in the Bear Lake corridor when the roads shut down, but you will have difficulty accessing the shuttle system when the road closes. There is a hiker shuttle that picks up riders in Estes Park at the town’s Visitor Center. You will find lines that are very long after 9:00 in the morning and it may take up to one hour to get on a shuttle that will take you to the Free Shuttle Park and Ride. Again, this sounds inconvenient, and it is the norm during the busy season, during the busy part of the day. You can avoid the crowds if you get parked and out on the trails before 8:00 in the morning. If you can’t make an early start, then find something else to do until you can enter the park after 4:00 in the afternoon. In the afternoon the crowds are leaving and you can usually find parking spaces and the traffic on the trails is thinning out. So to maximize your enjoyment, plan activities that start before 8:00 in the morning or after 4:00 in the afternoon. Consider doing sunset activities, or hiking in the dark after the sun goes down. Headlamps work fine and the night sky is amazing when the headlamp is switched off. Rocky Mountain National Park is a treasure. Many people know that and overcrowding is the result of widespread popularity. You can plan carefully and usually reduce the impact of the crowds on your visit. You will be able to do what you want to do and see the things you want to see. Study the Park website and carefully plan your visit to reduce the affect the crowds on your stay. Good luck and Cheers.","June 2, 2018",Shining Gem in the National Park System,773,"Westminster, Colorado",5

Rocky Mountains,"Four of us had the good fortune of visiting Rocky Mountain National Park at the end of August for a full day. As a mountain loving person, this national park is one of my favorites. I've visited it about 5 times prior to this visit. We arrived early, coming in from Estes Park and drove about 10 or 11 miles on Trail Ridge Road to a small parking lot where we could pick up the Ute Trail. This part of the Ute Trail skirts along Tombstone Ridge. We hiked the trail to Timberline Pass, about 2 miles in, taking in all of the vistas, as the entire portion of the trail is above tree line, before turning around and heading back to the parking lot. For us old folks, the hike took close to 3 hours, and we enjoyed every minute of it.Trail Ridge Road is just chock full of turn outs and parking areas offering amazing views throughout the park. Alpine Visitor Center is a must stop for everyone traveling through the park, with its exhibits, gift shop, snack bar and most important, the very knowledgeable Park Rangers and volunteers. And when you're there, you'll know you're high in the mountains as the air temperatures will be noticeably cooler if not cold.This entire park is a world full of wonder, from its forested trails to those above tree-line, from its mountain lakes to its grand vistas, from its areas of solitude to its abundant wildlife, this mecca in the mountains has it all. Be sure to have this place on your radar if you are going to venture into this part of America.As of this writing, Rocky Mountain National Park charges a $20.00 vehicle fee, good for 7 days, unless you are the holder of one of the interagency passes such as senior, access, military, etc., in which case the fee is waived.","October 29, 2017","RMNP: Majestic, Awesome",117,"Fargo, North Dakota",5

The next day Trail Ridge was open to Milner Pass (16 miles). We were a little disappointed that Trail Ridge wasn't open since the temperatures were in the 60s the next couple of days. When we were driving back home we checked the Trail Ridge road condition and found out it was open for the weekend. Seems like they could have gotten the road cleared a little sooner.

The park ranger at the entrance station gave us the map and a newsletter and waved us to enter without accepting any payment for entry. Since the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center was overflowing with cars, we decided to go to Bear Lake. On the way, there was a sign asking guests to visit Bear Lake after 3 PM as the parking lot was full. Disappointed, we decided to head to Many Parks Curve. We got a parking spot and took some time to take photographs of the Rocky Mountains. We had to turn back and visited Hidden Valley. Walked a small trail there and hopped into the car to head to Bear Lake once again. On the way, we saw a lot of elk freely roaming around giving us plenty of photo ops. On the way to Bear Lake, the sign was changed to say park at park and ride and take the shuttle to Bear Lake. We decided to try our luck and went all the way to Bear Lake. A car ahead of us got a spot while we had to turn around. Frustrated, we decided not to use the shuttle and headed to Moraine Park. This place had a lot of elk hanging around. We took some photographs and headed to West Horseshoe Park. Drove around that road visiting Alluvial Fan, End of Valley, Sheep Lakes, and stopped at Fall River Visitor Center.

Then sometimes we walk the town. This is always fun for people watching and to browse the quaint, often one of a kind, stores. The Stanley Hotel is located here. (The Shining).

The next morning the weather got better and we had a few hours of tiring the mountains. The trail ridge road was closed which happens often due the real high elevation.

This hike was mostly downhill, though the falls had an uphill approach. From there, we picked up the bus and rode down to the Park and Ride to pick up our car. We drove to Sprague Lake to go for a walk around the lake, and met some very nice folks to advised us to drive to Moraine Park for see the elk.

Rocky Mountains,"We loved the hikes we were able to take in the park. We hiked into Adam's Falls on the West side along with Cascade Falls. Cascade Falls was a much longer hike (about 7 miles round trip) compared to Adam's falls which was only 0.8 miles one way. We had children from ages 8-19 (we had a group of 10). We also hiked on the East side of the park to Alberta Falls and then on to Copeland and Calypso Falls. Copeland was only 0.3 miles in where if you kept going Calypso was over an additional mile (1.8 miles from the trailhead). All the falls were worth the hikes. We only wish we could have hiked into more of them. We also loved Trail Ridge Road. The first day we were in the park we were driving through around 5 pm. This was an amazing time to see wildlife. We saw dozens of Elk, some Deer, and even several moose (about 5). If I lived closer I would love to spend many a weekend exploring the rest of the park. I can't recommend exploring the park enough. We didn't stop at any of the several Visitor's centers. I did a lot of reading about the park online to plan out my stay. I also borrowed a book that my brother in law had purchased that gave a lot more information on various trails and views. I would recommend either purchasing a similar book, exploring and planning on-line, or making sure to stop and talk to an expert at a Visitor's center as there is so many options. Even if you are unable to do much exploring on foot there is much you can see from exploring the main roads of the park by vehicle.","August 27, 2017",For the love of waterfalls,15,"Richland, Washington, United States",5

Fairly easy hikes and you can get to each location from the other. We had a 4 and & 7 year old and they did fine. You can get to either locations using the park's shuttle and the Hiker's shuttle. If going in summer months definitely use the park shuttles and maybe even the Estes Park shuttle due to traffic. RMNP will shut down vehicular traffic (unless you are staying there) if it gets to be too much. That happened to us but we knew ahead of time and took the park's shuttle as we were only there for a day visit. We called when were about 1/2 hour away to get the latest status for parking and travel within the park.If you want to guarantee driving yourself and seeing wildlife get inside the park before 7am. On our visit (July 27) the parking lots were filled by 7:30am but did reopen at 11:30am though driving ourselves was still not an option. Every staff person or ranger was extremely helpful so don't be shy about asking questions. Watch the weather!!! During our stay we were told to watch for lightening and stay below the tree line. Take time to sit and just look. As our 4 year old grandson said twice: ""Isn't it beautiful."" We did see elk just off the road in mid day. Always take a jacket and plenty of water.Can't wait to return to see the whole park.","August 10, 2017",Humbling and Beautiful,29,"Janesville, Wisconsin",5
Rocky Mountains,"There are so many things to experience in life and this is one that everyone should add to their bucket list. We rented a car in Denver and made the 1 1/2 hour trip to Rocky Mountains national Forest. Truly breathtaking! We saw wild elk, moose, Black bear, and even a fox down by grand lake. We stopped by Adam's Falls and even got to experience getting snowed on in August! LOL! My family and I took a walk around Lake Irene and then did some other hiking. We also took the train ride at Silver plume. Short and sweet ride over clear creek and was given some basic history on gold mining in the area. We never got any altitude sickness or anything, but we decided to turn around before we got to Estes Park… Plan on being there for a minimum of 6-7 hours if you truly want to get the full experience. Don't rush yourself! Make sure that the vehicle you rent or own has excellent brakes. There are a lot of hairpin turns and steep roads to maneuver around. Just when you think you are in the clear, you were riding your brakes for a quite amount of time. Honestly, on our way there are kids were not into it. By the time we left, they were 100% worn out and had tons of pictures that they were sharing on different social media's. To me that means they loved it!!!","August 3, 2017",O. M.

There are a few hiking trails that start from that trailhead, but parking fills up by 8AM. If you miss parking, you'll have to take a shuttle up and down. Spend half a day hiking those trails, eat a packed lunch, and drive over to Trail Ridge Road. Enjoy!","July 5, 2017",Otherworldly... and so much to do!,136,New York,5

It about an hour drive. Go to welcome center and grab a map. We headed to Alberta Falls hike which is about 2 miles round trip on a relatively easy trail (we are from Miami so ANY incline is odd for us) . Stop along the hike to take pics. Beautiful views all around and we saw plenty of kids and even parents with babies so this is good for all ages.If you have more time you can plan a horseback ride or a picnic. Really beautiful place.

Be smart with winter mountain car trips, pack water, a couple of blankets, a candle, flashlight and some sustaining snack foods. Those are for emergency. Note, in many stretches cell phones have no service. You also want sunblock, sunglasses and lip balm for when you step out into the sun.

Not only can you get maps and an overview, but they have great staff that can give you suggestions on where to go to meet your hiking needs. Stop in Estes Park before you go and get lunch or supper at Subway or any other place - there are LOTS! Bring water and make sure you are at the meadow for the elk viewing at about 5:00.

It was still open but at the upper altitudes there was some snow and definitely chilly. There are plenty of places to pull off to see the scenery and lots of scenery to be seen. I made it all the way to the Alpine Visitor Center. Make sure you have a full tank of gas, water, snacks, jackets, and a camera. Comfy shoes for hiking trails is a must. The best time to visit is around 3:00 in the afternoon- I saw about 20-25 Elk and Marmats...it is basically a road trip with plenty of chances to stop. Restrooms are few and far between...try to make sure you stop prior to reaching the Alpine Center. There is a cafe and store there but was slammed full of people. You can pull off and picnic all along the way. Not a fast trip and will be limited once the real snowfall hits.

I intellectually knew, but had really never realized that the Colorado River which flows through western Colorado, Utah, the Grand Canyon and on through California to the Pacific Ocean actually STARTS in Rocky MT Nat Park - the HIGHEST National Park in the US.

We drove through a cloud (not really rain but we got wet) found ourselves amazed that in the middle of August we were higher than many large patches of snow.

We were fortunate in that we had purchased, some time ago, the Lifetime Pass for Senior Citizens, Age 62 or over. This saved us the entry fee, and the long wait at the toll booth.The drive through the park was challenging, but the sights were beautiful. We managed to get to the top at 945 Moraine Ave (addressed out of Estes Park), where we had some coffee and rested and took time to adjust to the high altitude, before moving on. We STRONGLY recommend that people do take their time and let their body adjust to the altitude. As we progressed on this high mountain road, we saw numerous elk, who were in their seasonal rut.

Here you are above some of the clouds, the air is thin and the temperature is at least 40 degrees cooler than before entering the park. On a hot sunny summer day in July it was 61 degrees at this altitude. If you are lucky you may see large Elk basking in the sun or grazing the tundra.

Drove Ridge Road to the tundra near the continental divide. Great access to the town of Estes Park for meals and supplies. Extremely quiet campground.

We visited in June and the short trails were crowded, but shuttle buses were provided for overflow parking. There was still a lot of snow and ice on the ground, but our family was able to hike anyway. You should always plan for changing weather - it may be warm at lower elevations and be very cold as you climb higher. Storms also come quickly then clear up. You also need to have plenty of water as the altitude can be a difficult adjustment. We saw so many animals - moose, elk, and birds.

Next day visited some lakes in park, did a hike around Bear Lake, etc. Take raingear as it can rain any second and it did! Went south the next day on one of the scenic drives. By the way Estes Park is a real nice town at 7,000 ft plus. Only 10 minutes from entrance to Park. River runs right through middle of town and very nice. Good eating everywhere!

Rocky Mountains,"Our trip this time to Estes Park focused on hiking in the Rocky Mountain National Park.No question in our minds that later September/early October is the best time to do so by far. Reduced crowds, brilliant foliage, especially Aspen leaf changes, cooler weather all combine to make this an outstanding time of year. The trails are well marked and maintained. The scenery beautiful. The hiking options so numerous it is hard to narrow them down.I am 72 years old and my wife close to that age. We recommend hiking poles and plenty of water. But don't let age stop you, even on some of the more demanding climbs. We were advised not to take the direct trail to Lake Bierstadt because of its steepness, but the switchbacks made it very doable, and the scenery was absolutely stunning. Much more so that the easier option that we took back. Point: This park is a true treasure that every American should experience if at all possible. Don't let age hold you back!!!In the review below: a car is very helpful but I think some times of year public transportation from Estes Park is available. Within RMNP there is free public transportation from parking areas to trailheads and other attractions. Food is available just outside the entrance on HW34 entrance, but take your own snacks and water, for sure.

They had a blast--especially when we saw the moose and her baby. I almost had a heart attack--the moose being less than 15 feet away. We saw marmots, squirrels and elk. It even rained on us, but we didn't care. At the turnaround point (a deserted settlement), we took off our hiking shoes stuck our feet in the freezing Colorado River.

All the rangers that we met were extremely friendly and helpful, and so were the other hikers. We got to see an elk family just two meters away from the trail, and deers and chipmunks just walking around close to our tent (at Moraine Campground). It's the perfect place to visit for families as well as experiences hikers. Between the campgrounds and the hiking trails there are shuttle buses leaving every 30 minutes or so.

It was perfect! Take along some advil for altitude issues, even if you are accustomed to higher elevations.","August 7, 2015",quiet perfection,162,western US,5
Rocky Mountains,Unfortunately we only had a few hours so we drove thru the park across the Trail Ridge Road. The temp was 61 degrees on the last day of July. The views are amazing and literally breath taking. Some of the most beautiful I have seen. This takes you across the Continental Divide and thru the Alpine Tundra. ,"August 2, 2015",Stunning vistas,19,"Muncie, Indiana",5
Rocky Mountains,"Didn't really do this park justice when visiting recently but the views and scenery are beautiful. Lots of stop off points on the route. We drove the route starting from Granby and finishing at Estes Park. Make sure you have plenty of time because although it's only a relatively short distance it will take time. There are plenty of places to stop, hike, take in the history and the views but be aware that there are currently major roadworks on the road and there is no alternative route! On a busy day you could be sitting in a queue and not moving for some time (we were sat for at least half an hour in one queue). That said it is worth it!","July 31, 2015",Fabulous scenery,31,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",5
Rocky Mountains,"I had never been hiking and chose the Rockies as my first destination to explore. The views were fabulous, the trails were manageable and it was such an awesome experience. I had the opportunity to hike three days in July and it was incredible. We did a Lake Trail the second day and the waterfalls and sights were exceptional! My cousin and I loved the Chasm Trail. I can't say enough about the park, the trails and the views.

Weather was moving in and we had a chance to literally drive through the clouds on our way up and around numerous mountain roads. In between patches of clouds, the view was spectacular of untouched mountain lakes and scenery. This place makes you want to buy a very expensive camera so you can really take those awesome shots. I will be coming back again for sure.","July 13, 2015","Breathtaking views, incredible wildlife",0,"Fort Collins, Colorado",5
Rocky Mountains,"I love the National Park system. Have been here before myself but had the opportunity to share it with my son and his family this summer. The grandkids are typical kids for this day and age. Interested in video games and amusement parks. But they also love history and science. So it was NOT difficult to get them into the park. Lots of areas to hike, climb on rocks, see water falls, etc. Went to each of the different visitors centers, participated in the Junior Ranger programs and went on as many ranger programs as we could. It always pleases me when I can spend time with them and find things that are not the ""norm"" for them but they enjoy!","July 13, 2015",OMG I can't say enough great things about this National Park!,89,"Texas Gulf Coast, Texas",5

We flew into Denver and drove up to Estes Park to stay at McGregor Lodge for 4 nights prior to 4th of July weekend. The rangers and volunteers are exceptonally nice and helpful. We drove the Trail Ridge Road one day and saw Big Horn Sheep and herds of elk just a stone's throw from the car. We rode the aerial tram in Estes Park which is very nice, lunch at the top, peanuts to feed to chipmunks's, hiking, bird-watching. The RMNP in general is uncrowded and very well kept, a pleasant surprise. Some of the more popular hiking trails such as at Bear Lake do get busy after about 830am but we went after 2pm, enjoyed the afternoon rain showers, saw elk and fawns around the lake, just majical.","July 8, 2015",Safari in the Rockies,17,California,5

Just like any National Park, get out of your car and hike for 30 minutes and you will be hard pressed to find any people at all... We traveled to the west side of the park and after seeing the gorgeous vistas on our way, we stopped at Lake Irene for lunch and a short hike then traveled down to a trailhead just south... We hiked for 4 plus miles on a beautiful trail through all sorts of different ecosystems..... Throughout the park we saw a plethora of critters including elk, deer, marmot and even a moose!!

Rocky Mountains,"We visit Estes Park every summer and the main reason is the beauty, peace and serenity we find in Rocky Mountain National Park. (see previous reviews) Here are some tips for visiting the park.Stop at the Visitor Centers near the Park Entrances before driving to the gates to pay the entrance fee which is currently $20 per car for a one or seven day pass. It will be increasing to $30 October 1. Ask all your questions at the Visitor Center so you don't hold up the lines to get into the Park. There is a fast lane for visitor's with passes, but only passes purchased at Rocky Mountain NP will work in this lane. We have Senior Lifetime passes and had to go through the Ranger operated lanes. If you are a Senior, you can purchase a Lifetime pass for $10.00 which is good at any National Park or Monument in the United States for the rest of your life. It's a great deal!Visit the Park early in the morning to see the wildlife, or head up to the Alpine Center around 3 p.m. You'll make it up to the Center before it closes at 5 p.m. Take your time coming back down because the animals are usually more visible later in the day when it's cooler. We saw moose last summer but were told they moved up to the western side of the park because it was too hot on the Estes side this summer. Stop at the pull-outs on Trail Ridge Road and take photos or walk the short trails to the lookouts. You will see lots of Yellow-bellied Marmots and pikas at the Rock Cut. The road to the Alpine Center is very steep and curving, so drive carefully. We saw a cinnamon bear heading up into the mountains late afternoon before we even entered the Park. Sometimes the small bears get into town and try to dumpster dive.The Upper Beaver Meadow trail is usually full of wildflowers, but we found it to be very dry and barren this year, so we headed to Hidden Valley. This area is breathtaking, full of wildflowers, little bridges over tumbling streams, towering pines and easy to walk trails. This area also houses the Junior Ranger Headquarters. There are clean restrooms and water fountains to use.If you want to spend a whole day in the park, head up to the Alpine Center in the morning. At the top you will find a Visitor Center, clean restrooms, large gift shop and in the back of the gift shop there is a place to grab a snack or lunch. There are tundra trails to walk up at the Center. When you're done there, take the road to the Continental Divide. It's beautiful but watch out for big horned sheep when driving. As we were leaving the parking area, one jumped in front of our vehicle and our son-in-law barely missed it.Another beautiful place to spend a few hours is Lily Lake, which is actually outside of the Park. The 3/4 mile hiking trail circles the lake and is a flat, easy to walk trail. Along the way are masses of beautiful wildflowers and marshlands. We saw several muskrats swimming across the lake. Bear Lake is also beautiful, but if you don't start out early, the parking lot will be full. Don't give up on seeing Bear Lake. Just park your vehicle in the overflow lot and take the shuttle to the lake. They run quite often so its not much of a wait to take it back to your car.When driving at dusk, be very aware of deer on or near the roadways in the Park and everywhere else in town for that matter. The elk like to wander into town as well, though we haven't seen as many this year as in past years, not even up in the Park. They seem to be staying at the higher elevations possibly to avoid the heat.Whatever you decide to do and see in RMNP, it's always an adventure.

As we passed what I thought was fog, my friends told me that it was actually clouds. No wonder we could barely see! It was warm and sunny down below, but snowing up at the top.

Rocky Mountains,"“Whether you’re a man, woman or (human) child, or a panther or a ghost, or a Douglas Fur, a fungal spore, a brittle layer of sedimentary rock or sloooow ooze of igneous, or a crystal in formation (good luck with that dude!), you will totally enjoy the Rocky Mountains. The skiing is sublime. The air is pure. The sheer profusion of varied lifeforms—the bulbous tip of a mushroom thrusts up from a spongy pad of moss, some yahoo from Cleveland hoots and throws a bottle off the cliff—will astonish you. There is a lake of pure methane. And especially if you are of a mineral nature, there is a lot going on here! Go deep underground for some tectonic action: there are quite a few hot zones of subduction where you can slip your plate against another. (Be patient.) The mantle can get pretty toasty though!

And when you want to find it just ask a park ranger, they try to keep track where you can spot some elk or rams. Trails from easy to moderate to difficult, pick your path. One warning, keep your eyes on the weather. If the fog starts to roll in make your way down the mountains before it gets dark. The fog is very thick and you don't know when an animal may walk out onto the winding roads.","September 12, 2014",Natures Post Card,64,"Walled Lake, Michigan",5

Rocky Mountains,"Coming from Arizona, our first campsite was Hermosa Springs adjacent to Haviland Lake near Durango. Each spot is secluded. The host helped us by chopping wood and provided a map of nearby hikes. The hikes around the lake were short so we drove to find other trailheads. Next time we will buy the $4 hike book from the forest service.Our second campsite was 14 miles east of Aspen in higher elevations, called Lost Man Campground (around 9,000 ft elevation). Arriving on Monday helped find many choices of empty spaces. Unfortunately, there was no camp host here and the toilets were smelly and dark. This one had the most beautiful 9 mile loop hike right across the road--filled with meadows, flowers, waterfalls. This is my favorite hike ever and looked like spring in August. It climbs up to Independence Pass but we were acclimatizing to the high altitude and turned around when we were satisfied (6 hours round trip). Both campsites were managed by Colorado Forest Dept and accept the Interagency Senior Pass which made our site $9.50 per night.Colorado has so many camping and hiking opportunities. Its lottery pays for recreational improvements. We even passed a Braille and Accessible trailhead on the way down to Aspen.","August 17, 2014",Camping and Hiking,32,"Prescott, Arizona",5

Rocky Mountains,This was my first trip to the Rockies and it didnt disappoint. We traveled first to Yellowstone and then to Glacier but snowfall kept us from seeing mountain vistas at Glacier. We never saw moose anywhere until we got to the valley on the west side of the peak. We drove thru RM Natl Park on way back to Denver and it more than made up for not getting to travel the Going to the Sun road at Glacier. The road and views of mountain peaks with snow were absolutely amazing. It seemed you would never get to the top and you were almost afraid to look down out your window as the road was literally on the edge! I would go back again in a heartbeat.,"July 30, 2014",mountains are breathtaking,6,"Watertown, Tennessee",5

Rocky Mountains,"We visited the Rockies on July 19th during one of the hottest days of the year. However, once we were up in the mountains it cooled off enough that it was enjoyable. It costs $20 per vehicle to enter or they take the National Park Pass. We have a pass.We hit the entrance to the park right at 8am. I suggest to get there earlier during the busy season. We lucked out because one of our passengers legitimately needs a handicapped hang tag, so we were able to find parking. However, the other car in our group got behind us about 30 minutes trying to find parking. It was very busy.","July 27, 2014",Beautiful,3,,5
Rocky Mountains,"This is a beautiful National Park. It has everything. Mountains, trails, lakes, sights too numerous to see. The Rangers are friendly and very helpful. They will help you determine the best way to spend your available time. And help you at whatever level of fitness you are. From driving the trail rim road, to moderate hiking to see Lakes and Waterfalls, to more strenuous experiences .We were able to spend two days here. I would recommend at least three days to be able to see and experience the Park. We only saw the East side of the mountains. I would like to see the West side. Now, you have to be aware that this is not Disney. While we were there, lighting strikes killed two hikers near where we were. The weather can change very quickly and turn dangerous. The Ranger advised us to not hike across a meadow because of the chance of lighting and we listened. Gift shop at the Alpine stop is very nice and nice food available.

Rocky Mountains,"Just got back from Estes Park and had a good time despite the speed traps. First of all let me say that the views in the park were glorious. We saw beaver, elk, moose, pika, and marmots. I also saw a park ranger who gave me a $125 speeding ticket! There are several places in and out of the park where the speed limit suddenly drops from 40 down to 25 for no apparent reason. Of course this is where the cops sit to nail out of town tourists. The officer said it was because people could hit an elk. This argument does not hold water since there are elk EVERYWHERE. There are herds of them roaming around town day and night and two of them sat outside the entrance to our hotel for hours. So all of the roads should be 25 mph, right? There was also a $20 entrance fee to the park. Since this is a federal park, aren't we already paying for it with our taxes? I can easily afford the fee but what about low income people who can't. Shouldn't they be able to enjoy the park too? Anyway, Estes Park itself is pretty but nearly everything closes by 9 pm so you had better not wait to eat unless you like McDonalds.","June 22, 2014",Speed trap warning,27,"Lawrenceburg, Indiana",3

Rocky Mountains,"Oh, how we love this park. Being from Louisiana, we can't be here as often as we wish, but we've made several trips over our lifetime and it never disappoints. The drive from Estes Park to Grand Lake on Trail Ridge Road is just amazing. The views on this trip in late August were not as beautiful as those in early summer when the mountaintops are still snow-covered. We have been at the Alpine Visitor Center on July 4th several times and it has snowed every time! Estes Park is very commercialized; Grand Lake is just a little old western town with some touristy shops and restaurants and a beautiful lake with a beach. Our favorite campground in RMNP is Timber Creek Campground which unfortunately has had most of the beautiful trees cut down because of the devastating pine bark beetle. The ranger-led hikes and night programs are extremely good. The meals we've had at the Fall River Visitor Center complex are delicious. Consider staying at the pricey Stanley Hotel in Estes Park for a night - nice rooms, good dining, and the view from the porch is awesome.","April 23, 2014",Our favorite national park,71,"Des Allemands, Louisiana",5
Rocky Mountains,"We visit Rocky Mountain National Park on 2nd week of March 2014. We stay at River Stone and Bear Paw Resort located at beautiful village of Este Park. This small town is completed with everything that you need. Cafe, restaurants, shops, grocery store, etc. 90% of the shops are open even it was the very early of Spring.Our pretty cabin at River Store Resort is literally a complete house where you can stay forever. Complete modern kitchen with oven, stove, microwave and big freezer. Washing and drying machine. Fireplace, jacuzzi tub and grill. PERFECT! plus a river running in front your porch. What even make it best value is the 3rd night free for weekday stay.It is no rush and hurry to go around since the national park is only 15 minutes away. We visited the trail ridge road that unfortunately close due to heavy snow. But we manage to walk about 300 meters inside the trail and it is so whitely beautiful. On the 2nd day we visited Bear Lake and Alberta fall with tracking from the parking lot. Not so many people on the trail. The snow is packed so good hiking shoe will do. You need to watch for the signage that buried under the snow. The Bear Lake was completely covered by tick snow so its looks like a meadow covered with snow. The Alberta fall does not even have a drop of water…however it is still beautiful. We have to make many stops to take pictures of the ""smoky"" snowy mountains. The wind blowing the snow at the top of the blue mountains will keep you staring and staring again. During the stay and in the trail we manage to see dear, bird, moose and mountain goat and of course domestic K-9. Although that is not much activities during the early spring but the visit was satisfactory. A breath taking peace full place. We leave on the 3rd day to Colorado Spring via Peak to Peak Scenic Way …and again it was a wonderful trip. We stop by St Catharina Church. This beautiful church is sitting on the big rock. Inside the church you will find a picture of pope visiting this church.","March 14, 2014",Spectacular peaceful place,36,"Jakarta, Indonesia",5

Rocky Mountains,"Every view was a postcard! Wonderfully healthy, beautiful herds of elk everywhere. Get to the park early and it is not only free, but you see so much more wildlife. Watch the sun rise over the mountains and see some incredibly beautiful views. As one friend described Rt 34 Trail Ridge Road as the OMG Trail Ridge Road, from the West Gate heading towards Estes Park is a beautiful and challenging trip. It takes you to the alpine area and incredibly open and high mountains. The Alpine Visitor center is beautiful and has a wonderful restaurant and gift shop. Sit have some coffee and something to eat and watch the elk in the valley below the window (looked about the size of ants!). The people working in the park are friendly and helpful. The altitude is not for the faint of heart and the roads can be challenging for us sea level people, but if you white knuckle it a bit you can see Lake Irene, Milner Pass, and so much more. Elk, sheep, and all sorts of little critters that live up there. Take your time breath deep, drink a lot of water and eat plenty of carbs; this helped me make it to the top of the trail next to the Alpine Visitor Center, over 12,000 feet. For greenhorns, take your time, use the pull over areas to let the hotshots by and just be careful. It is a great experience. Takes a good 2.5 hours to get to Estes Park, especially if you stop at the overlooks. Watch for afternoon thunderstorms on the Western side and plan your travel accordingly. EARLY (around 6 AM elk cross the roads in the west. Great experience!","July 16, 2013",Great Park,5,Kenmore,5

Once you reach Emerald Lake, you realize the tiring walk was worth it as the view is amazing. I couldn't take enough pictures!

I was in awe of the scenery as we drove to the park, it was even better once inside. $20 park entrance fee required, but well worth it (and lasts a week). We were a little disappointed that Trail Ridge Road was closed(seasonal) but that was our fault for not researching it first. We started our exploring on the easiest path first, Sprague Lake. It was a half mile flat path that encircled the small lake. Then we drove to the Bear lake trail head and hiked up to Dream lake. (2 miles round trip). There is road construction going on at the park so it took longer to get from place to place. We saw a few herds of elk. They were so close to the road and I was amazed at the sounds they make! So many different birds to see as well. I would love to come back at each of the different seasons.","November 13, 2012","First time to the mountains, LOVED IT.",93,"Chicago, Illinois",5

One young bull was laying in the shade under a tree close enough that we could get some great photos. We also encountered female elk on a hiking trail and were no more than 100 feet away from us. Hiking to a waterfall was a bit taxing for a few older individuals in our party but well worth it, as it was rushing with run-off and just stunning! The park is teeming with wildlife and the landscapes are gorgeous! I would suggest bring binoculars.

Saw some Elk, birds etc. Took some great photos and enjoyed the cool temperatures. $20 per car access fee but well worth it. Other access pass prices are available for purchase if one plans to come back for other visits.

But Fido, while welcome in the campgrounds, is not welcome on the trails anywhere in the park -be mindful. We were surprised by that, and it is enforced.Reservations are required, absolutely, until October 15th when they stop accepting reservations and they turn off the water.

The trailheads have small parking lots and they are full by 8:00 a.m. The shuttle system is free and frequent. My only complaint is for a family that wants to hike all day, you need to carry your lunch with you. If the park had lockers or restaurants it would be a huge bonus. There are many small easy hikes or you can do longer and harder hikes. There are many small glacier lakes with trails that are made for wheelchairs or strollers. (Sprague Lake and Lily Lake are two I remember) Flat and beautiful and short walk around the lake. We hiked to Emarald Lake, past Dream Lake, absolutley beautiful. An Elk was 50 feet from the trail eating away. The elk was not spooked at all with the people, it just kept eating.

All picnic areas have nice tables, firepits, and bathrooms (some vault).Junior Ranger Program-This FREE program involves children of all ages to become a RMNP Junior Ranger. Stop by a Ranger Station/Visitor Center for a age appropriate booklet. I thought the book for my son (age 5 and under booklet) was excellent. He earned a badge when we turned in the completed booklet, which he wore proudly.Reminders for the Park:1-It rains almost EVERYDAY in the summer--short springlike showers in the afternoons. 2-Pack a backpack with neceessities-water, snacks, sunscreen, bug spray, bear spray/whistle, small first aid kit, umbrella/ponchos, sweatshirts (it gets COLD in the evenings!),3-Stay in the car while viewing wildlife. People approach a grazing elk and then wonder why they get charged!!!!!! The wildlife seem tame, but use common sense please! 4-Take the camera with LOTS of batteries and film!

Because the day we visited, there is snow fall and we could not hike to the most places. Always wear winter clothing when u r planning to visit even in fall since the more altitude you hike it will be too cold. Sunset and Sunrise is worth watching. Though we are unable to view Sunrise we enjoyed the sunset at Rocky mountains. No need to carry water bottle if you hike in winter but should be full packed with winter clothing.

If you are into 4-wheeling then there are plenty of opportunities. There are camping sites galore. The scenery is breathtaking. There is variety. You can go from mountain to flat land in no time. If you are into outdoor adventure then you can not get bored here. There are people who have lived all their life here exploring and they still find something new.
