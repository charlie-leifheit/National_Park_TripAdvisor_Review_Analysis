Indiana Dunes State Park,The beach at this park is certainly the most beautiful beach i have ever seen also the 3 dune challenge lived upto its hype il definately go here again,"October 10, 2019",The 3 dune challenge was enjoyable and the state park beach is mesmerizing,4,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Indiana dunes is a beautiful park, with an easy to get to beach (go early because beach gets very crowded even in September when we went), nice maintained trails with nice views of Lake Michigan. We didn't like seeing power plants in either direction when looking down the beaches, but the lake is gorgeous especially on a sunny day like we had. Surrounding small cities are just okay. My husband and I drove all around to michigan city and portage, which in my opinion weren't worth going to. Portage Riverwalk was closed, where we did walk is next to power plant and the bugs will eat you alive, michigan city looks rough and run down. However, we had a great day at the dunes, the very small historic downtown Chesterton was cute, and the Coffee Creek Watershed preserve was a really pretty area to visit by our hotel.","October 10, 2019",Would go again,0,,4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"This just became a National Park a few months ago, so that is definitely exciting! Definitely hike the 3 Dune Challenge, it was actually a challenge hiking up and down the sand dunes! You pick up the trail right behind the nature center and it is pretty well marked and easy to navigate. Great views from the top! Unfortunately you can only hike Mt. Baldy with a guide so we did not get that hike in since we went in September. The guided hikes are only offered in the summer months. There is a $12 per car entrance fee so be sure to arrive early to get all the hiking in!","October 9, 2019",Make sure to hike the 3 Dune Challenge!,3,"Cleveland, United States",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,We got to the dunes and walked down to the beach. It simply was a beautiful scene. We walked over to the pavilion and beach house. We hiked up Devil's Slide. The beach house was closed but we did rinse our feet before jumping into the car. The scenery was very pretty. We would like to get back there and do more of the trails. ,"September 23, 2019",Wow isn't enough!,7,,5

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We camped in the park for two nights, hiked a few of the trails, and enjoyed the beach. The beach was only open for swimming on weekends, which worked out well to coincide with our visit. The water is cold, but refreshing on a hot day. The trails are well-traveled and maintained, and the trail between the beach and campground was a super easy walk with gorgeous scenery. The sand is soft and the beach is pretty well maintained.Bathrooms were clean and modern, campground is similar to other state parks we've visited. If you're camping, be aware that you can't use fallen limbs or sticks for your campfire; it's best to bring or purchase fire starter from the camp store. Camp store has wood, ice, some snacks, and other potential necessities you may have forgotten.There was one playground within the campground, and it was a bit on the small side, but a more modern style, which the kids seemed to enjoy. Lots of kids on bikes (as we typically expect), and plenty of roads to ride. There are several trails accessible from the campground, so lots of room to explore, too.We had a great time and can't wait to come back and explore more!","September 9, 2019","Gorgeous scenery, excellent trails",1,,5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Note that the National Park and State Park are connected, but different experiences. The State Park charges a separate entrance fee, and as an Indiana resident, it is a wonderful and affordable way to spend a day in both woods and beach. The nature center is informative and has a great nature room to hear and see a variety of birds and animals. Extensive marsh and birding areas (we saved these for another visit), and relaxing walk along Lake Michigan beach. An unexpected and very pleasant local vacation option for Northern Indiana: not very far, but much better than a regular ""staycation"".","September 8, 2019",Very nice local option,14,"Lafayette, Indiana",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"waited in traffic for 50 minutes to get into the park on a holiday. Park staff very friendly. Park very nice,clean. stayed 3 nights at the campground, very quiet. we will be back. hiked the dunes, did not have time to hike all the trails we wanted to, will plan to be back","September 7, 2019",wonderful visit,9,"Evansville, Indiana",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"The visitors center is a great place to start off a visit. They've got all the details and some cool artwork. Next we headed into the park. We got there fairly early, so the line of cars wasn't too long. We hiked one the dunes before the kids were over it (they just wanted to sit on the path and play in the sand)Finally, we hit the beach to finish off the day. Lake Michigan is markedly warmer on the Indiana side than the Chicago side. The beach was very full, but it was the perfect day to be by the water.The whole family enjoyed the visit, and we'll have to go back when the kids' legs have grown some and climb all three dunes!","September 7, 2019",Lovely park!,0,,5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"While the shore and the dunes are beautiful and interesting I think the old growth black oak forest (some up to 140 feet high and many hundreds of years old) is the gem of this park. We went to the beautiful nature center (a must-see) and they pointed out the forest behind the center. So My wife and I walked the paths of the forest and they were a combination of humus and sand and it was so soft we took off our sandals and walked barefooted. Breathe deep, look wide, listen silently and let the forest speak to you of better things. We will return to spend more time there soon. ","September 3, 2019",Amazing old growth forest!,6,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Indiana Dunes, so much to do here! We found the 5 homes from the 1933 Worlds Fair to be a real attraction, even though we could only view them from the outside. The Dunes, beach, park, walking trails are awesome! Be sure to stop at the visitors center first. It really helps plan your visit according to how much time you have for your visit. From just a couple hours to even a few days, the friendly, knowledgeable staff will definitely help you make the most of your visit according to what interests you most.","September 3, 2019",Did not miss the newest National Park!,6,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"The park was very busy but we could still maneuver around to see the nice water, green grass, tall dunes, and buildings. The line to get in took a while but we waited patiently:)","August 31, 2019",Beautiful park,6,"Fort Wayne, Indiana",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Loved everything about this state park -- great trails, beautiful and clean lakefront, many spots available throughout the park for a picnic. I particularly liked coming to the beach in the morning -- much less busy.I accepted the 3 Dune Challenge and made it! The trail is rated as ""rugged"" for a reason -- steep ascents on sand were a challenge, but the views were worth it!","August 28, 2019",What a great state park!,2,"Omaha, Nebraska",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,Loved this State Park! We had a lot of fun in the trails. I’d love to come back someday and camp out for a few days. ,"August 28, 2019",Hiking vacation ,0,"Greenwood, Indiana",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,An amazing and breathtaking place as you walk along Lake Michigan surrounded by the Indiana dunes. Nice lakefront area for you to swim with nice bathroom facilities.,"August 21, 2019",Great State Park,1,,5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"The visitor centre isn’t far from the freeway and offer plenty of information about the park plus rest rooms. The main beach is another couple of miles further on and it’s here you pay your entrance fee. There is lots of parking, a cabin selling drinks and snacks, restrooms and showers. The beach is beautiful and stretches in both directions. It a great place to spend time.","August 20, 2019",Lovely beach,210,"Rayleigh, United Kingdom",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Clean campground with plenty of amenities (camp store for forgotten bug spray), spacious bathrooms/showerhouses, within walking distance to the train station if you want to head into Chicago for the day, and a beautiful walk to an amazing beach! The waves were huge and loud enough to hear from our campsite. My boys LOVED exploring and running down the dunes. It's hard to believe you find this sort of beach and water area in Indiana!","August 20, 2019",Great time!,0,,5
Indiana Dunes State Park,We loved coming to the Dunes for a visit. The beach was nice. There seemed to be alot of trails you can go on. ,"August 19, 2019",Beach ,1,,5
Indiana Dunes State Park,We stopped here on a Sunday morning. Plan on arriving early as the line to get in on a weekend is very long. The beach is beautiful but was very crowded in the guarded area when we were there. We hiked part of the 3 dune challenge. It would have been better to start early in the morning as hiking uphill on sand is quite challenging and things take longer. It was amazing how quick the scenery changed on the hike and it was quite interesting. The trails were not crowded.,"August 18, 2019",Beautiful beach and challenging hike,36,"Sterling, Illinois",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We live 3 hours south of this park, but we try to make it up every couple of years. We always enjoy our visit. It's nice to relax at the beach or climb the dunes. They are much more strenuous than they appear from below. But the views are amazing!","August 16, 2019",Always enjoy our time here,15,"Seymour, Indiana, United States",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"The beach was beautiful! Not too crowded on the day we went. Water was chilly but got used to it fast. However, the state park beach was closed due to “not enough life guards” so we had to stay on the other side of the border line on Porter Beach. What’s funny is they had 6-8 people riding around on four wheelers telling people to get out of the water constantly so seems to me half of those employed could have been life guards and then people could just enjoy the water..","August 15, 2019",Beach Visit,0,,4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Stopped at our nation's newest park a few weeks ago en route to Chicago. Do stop at the park information center on the way in. The rangers are so helpful in providing information about which area you should visit depending on how much time you have. They also have great information on the flora/fauna of the park, the sea life and the birds that reside in the park. Super interesting! We had limited time, so drove to the main beach area. There are several great hikes there that if you complete them, you are high enough up to see across to Illinois and other parts. It was so hot that we just skipped it. But the beach was great. Not from the Midwest so had never been on the Great Lakes before. WOW! Lake Michigan is something else. We dipped our toes in the water and were able to look across at Chicago. So cool! At the top of the walk down to the beach, there are changing areas, bathrooms, a snack bar and a small gift shop that sells sunscreen, park tees, etc. We only got to be at the park for about an hour but really enjoyed it. Just a neat national park. Make sure to include a stop here on your next visit to the Chicago-Indiana area.","August 14, 2019",Gorgeous beach on the shores of Lake Michigan with a stellar view of Chicago...,53,"Edmonds, Washington",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Although I had a huge problem being on a beach flanked by industrial pollution, this is a gorgeous park and is part of the larger Indiana Dunes National Park. The dunes were beautiful and fun to climb. The views at the top were beautiful. The lake was really cold but fun to play in. The park rangers were paying attention and making sure safety was maintained. It was also very clean overall.","August 10, 2019",Wonderful!,3,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,We had a blast climbing the Dunes! My older son who is not an exercise enthusiast complained the whole way up the Dune. Once he got to the top...he was a changed man! Now he wants to return everyday on our vacation to climb the Dunes and walk the trails! Now that is a parenting win!,"August 9, 2019",Family friendly hikes,0,,5

Indiana Dunes State Park,We stayed 2 nights at the Indiana Dunes State Park and had a great time. The campground had full electric and water hook-ups. The bathrooms were OK; sort of what you'd expect from a state park.The Three Dunes Challenge did not disappoint and is worth the walk! We went during a summer heat wave and swimming in Lake Michigan was a must!,"August 6, 2019",Great state park with excellent campground,3,,5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"I'm from the Pacific Northwest so the parks' notion of ""mountains"" were comical to me (a whopping 192 feet elevation gain!) but the trails were still nice, albeit short. My boyfriend and I flew in to Chicago, rented an RV and did a north-Midwest roadtrip, starting with the Indian Dunes. There was an accident on the main highway out of Chicago, so Google routed us basically through the city itself. Driving on city streets in an RV was _not_ fun and there was still quite a bit of traffic, so it was a bit of a pain to get out to the park, but we finally made it. The RV campground was well-maintained and obviously very popular, even on a Wednesday, with relatively clean bathrooms and warm showers. We stayed at 6 different RV parks during our trip, and this one was probably the most densely populated. I intentionally tried to pick a spot that didn't have a neighbor on one side for a little more quiet and privacy.","August 4, 2019",Nice park for RV camping,33,"Seattle, Washington",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We started off on a Saturday morning by following a user's recommendation on here from 2018. Tried Central Beach in Michigan City, IN, a few miles down the road east from the State Park entrance. We had ample parking when we arrived around 9:30 am but the beach had eroded and wasn't the same when we talked about it to those who were returning from there. Then, we tried Kemil Beach west of it, the beach looked fantastic but NO parking available around 10 am. Then, we tried Porter Beach slightly west of the State Park main entrance beach, we finally found both the beach and parking at 10:30 am (though it was in someone's backyard by Porter Beach they were charging $10 for all day parking making a killing, increased to $20 at 1:30 pm when we left).Moral of the story - if you want free parking and beach access on a Saturday, the weekends are the worst, better get there by 9 am to hit the smaller beaches. However, the main State Park has far more parking spots but the area of the beach close to the parking ends up being the most crowded. Areas slightly west (Porter Beach) or east (Kemil Beach) are less crowded but parking is at a premium there, you choose. Restrooms were available off the main State Park entrance, and by Kemil Beach and Porter Beach away from the main entrance.Pitched up a canopy tent with another family and enjoyed 3 hours in the sun. The water was slightly cold but once you get in and get used to it, it felt great under the sun. I was about 30-40 feet off the shore and it was barely 4 feet in depth, very shallow. My daughter and her friend enjoyed it a LOT.If you are by the shore but about 20-30 feet away, yes, you will run into those biting flies, so be prepared to deal with those or be on the move. As you got closer to the water or set up closer to the water, I did not experience flies. Just conquered 1 dune with a friend of mine, that was enough for me :).Cell reception was good enough at the entrance of the beach but once you get further away from the State park entrance, it gets real bad.Overall, a wonderful experience but lessons learned for next time.","August 2, 2019",Great experience if you can get there early,8,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We visited with our 5 children at the end of June hoping to hike, swim and enjoy the outdoors. We hiked for a bit, but were bothered by the many flies and decided to cool off by the water. Near the water we were met with an unbelievable amount of pesky, biting flies. Imagine 10+ flies on your leg at a time. The only minor reprieve we could find was to keep moving. We tried bug spray which seemed to help a little...maybe? We tried to swim but unless you were up to your neck in water the flies would bite. Upon seeing blood dripping down my leg from a bite we decided it was time to go! If you plan a trip I suggest doing some research on fly season and bite prevention. Otherwise I'd stay away.","August 2, 2019",Beautiful scenery infested with biting vampire flies!,1,,2
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Went with daughter and her 2 young boys (2 & 5). Water was cold, but kids enjoyed it. They also enjoyed climbing the dunes. Plenty of stuff to do in the vicinity, including a large children's museum not too far away. This is a continuation of the Michigan Dunes, so if you've been there, more of the same.","July 28, 2019",Good trip for children,8,"Beavercreek, Ohio",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"After climbing the dunes the grandkids were ready for the water. it was a little crowded on Wednesday afternoon, but they had a great time climbing the dunes then getting into Lake Michigan. There were lifeguards and a shower area. Picnic tables and lots of sand. They want to go again.","July 26, 2019",A Day in the Sun,78,"Brazil, Indiana",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"This state park is contained within the new national park, so it is a little confusing. There are quite a few trails allowing you to walk up these killer dunes - and it is strenuous to crawl your way up the side of the shifting sand. A large beach area was packed on the recent warm afternoon. Beautiful sand beach. The Sleeping Bear Dunes in upper Michigan is more dramatic, but this is worth the trip. $7 entry fee.","July 26, 2019",Nice Hiking Trails,498,"San Francisco, California",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,It was nice to climb up the dune called Devils slide and watch the sunset over Chicago. It makes me sad to see people leaving trash behind though. ,"July 23, 2019",Sunset visit. ,36,"Cleveland, Ohio",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"I was excited about visiting the newest national park in the US. It is convenient to travel to by train from Chicago on the South Shore Line, which makes it great for travellers who want to avoid using a car. Admittedly the refreshement franchises were typical of a beach resort - hot dogs and ice cream - however, they were rather good. However, following the trails through the forest would have been great had it not been for the number of insects! So, if you are to go into the woods be sure to take your insect spray.","July 21, 2019",Buzzy day at lakeshore national park,11,"Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom",3
Indiana Dunes State Park,Not what I thought it would be. Took a mile hike to get to the beach. Overcrowded. The traffic to get in was terrible. Not worth it. Go up to Michigan for better beaches and dunes.,"July 20, 2019",Not What I thought,66,"Linton, Indiana",3
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We stopped twice on our recent trip. Hiked the dunes both times; I forgot how difficult it is to hike on sand. The water was a bit chilly, but the uncrowded beach made for a great visit","July 15, 2019",Wonderful,112,"Kingwood, Texas",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"My husband and I brought our 2 year old here the first week of July. Because we aren't Indiana residents, we paid $12 to get in, but consider this a good value for having access to a very nice, well kept, lifeguard serviced beach with toilets and outdoor showers. Lake Michigan was beautiful, and we enjoyed relaxing in the sunshine and building sand castles all day: I really felt like I was at the ocean, rather than a lake. There are dunes to climb if you want a workout with a pay-off view, and lots of hiking trails. I took my daughter on a short hike between the beach and camping area, which was so calm and peaceful. Highly recommended for nature lovers.","July 15, 2019",Lovely Time At The Beach,38,"Shawnee, Kansas",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"There is a difference between the Dunes National Lakeshore and a Dunes State Park. It cost $12 to get into the Park for nonresidents but it is worth the money. My friend and I did the three vertical challenge. I’m from Michigan, where we have larger sand dunes, and I did not think it was that difficult, not the same for my friend. We enjoyed being able to go straight to the lake after we were finished. The beach was crowded and you only can swim in the designated areas due to some reason. You can park directly at the beach. There are multiple trails you can explore.","July 14, 2019",State Park,55,"Grand Blanc, Michigan",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"I visited in late morning the weekend before Independence Day and it was SO crowded. We weren't sure what to do/where to go so we went first to the Visitors Center at the National Lakeshore and asked the ranger for suggestions for a party with small kids and seniors. He told us to not even watch the 12-minute video in the visitor's center, but rather get in the car and go directly back to the state park because the parking lots fill up and then they'll start to restrict entry to the park. There was a huge line of traffic to enter the park. We saw one police car parked along the way but he was not assisting in directing traffic. One beach parking lot was already closed but we were lucky to get into the second lot. The beach was moderately crowded at 11am. There was one dune next to the beach where we were located. We would've liked to have found a trail to walk but it seemed the one the ranger recommended was beyond a building (The Pavillion?) on across the beach. With a baby and a senior in our party we didn't want to set out looking for it. The park apparently does not have any driveable areas, apparently because the dunes aren't visible from the roads or any trails that you can get to easily? Or maybe we just didn't know where to go. On the way out of the park around 1pm the line to get in was even longer than when we arrived two hours earlier. So if you are going to go on a summer weekend, go EARLY! Arrive before 10am.","July 14, 2019",A Bit Disappointing,13,"Louisville, Kentucky",3
Indiana Dunes State Park,We love the dunes. Big sandy beach and not a lot of rocks. Be prepared to wait in line to enter the park though; we arrived early (9:00) and we waited to get in. Traffic was lined up (likely to 94) when we left at 11:00 (hey we had to be home to bottle wine - don’t judge). ,"July 13, 2019",Beautiful shoreline ,99,"Dyer, Indiana",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Even so it is now a National Park. It is still under the control of the state of Indiana, and therefore you have to pay $12 and your national Park Pass is not valid. The dunes at Sleeping Ber are. Ich more spectacular","July 11, 2019",Disappointng,57,,2
Indiana Dunes State Park,"I have been to the dunes once before and was excited to show my friend. We arrived 30 minutes before sunset. Nice place to take pics, feel the sand under your feet, wade through the water and watch the sunset. We did have to watch where we stepped though, due to garbage hiding in the sand. Not sure if it is washing ashore, but the sand needs combed through and cleaned up.","July 8, 2019","Great view, but watch where you step!",2,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"This was our first visit to the park since childhood ... and things have changed. But that’s not because of the “national park” designation you may have heard of. That applied to the extensive Indiana Dunes National Seashore outside the state park ... and you’ll pay the $7/car in-state admission even if you have a national park pass. What we found on this warm Sunday before the Fourth of July was an almost hour-long traffic jam on IN49, the only access to the park. The route was poorly signed, and we saw one parked police car but no attempt at managing traffic. Once in the park, we were disappointed that there is no drive with lake views and pull-offs, which would make it more “Boomer-friendly.” What we did find was a huge parking lot with people barbecuing, playing music and the beach packed with people to the water line. No fun for us. Did walk to The Pavilion that I remembered from childhood. The Art Deco building now stands gutted and plans for it seem uncertain. So there wasn’t much for us to see or do. You might consider alternatives available in the Indiana Dunes National Park.","July 7, 2019",Congested on the weekend,249,West Lafayette,2
Indiana Dunes State Park,"This is our second trip to Indiana Dunes State Park Campgrounds, and though I love the campground I was very disappointed that I had intentionally reserved a site that backed up to a playground only to find the playground had been removed and all that was there was a dirt pile. Apparently they are planning on replacing it with a new playground and we just happened to show up in between. Besides that little disappointment and the fact that the dump station lacked the proper attachment to hose out our black tank we love coming here.","July 5, 2019",The playground was a dirt pile!,10,"Chilton, Wisconsin",3
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We visited Indiana Dunes State Park beach and Indiana Dunes National Park. The beach was great, lots of clean sand and very long stretch of beach/waterfront for the large summer crowds.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"My kids wanted to head to the beach. Living in Indiana, lake Michigan is where you go. We drove the two hours to spend a lovely summer day at the dunes. We've been quiet a few times before. This time, we were swarmed with biting flies. We couldn't eat our lunch because the flies attacked our food. The kids headed to the water, and had a great time. I stayed back and got eaten alive by two types of flies. Large black ones and tiny little black flies. It was miserable. No amount of repellent, swatting, cover, wind, would get these little boogers to leave. It wasn't just us, everyone else was being eaten alive as well. Some had it worse than others. Like I said we have been several other times throughout the years, and have never ever encountered such an experience. I wanted to go back a few times this summer, but it doesn't seem like that'll be happening.Also, dude with the microphone and loudspeaker, he seemed to enjoy his job a bit much.My take, skip the beach. ","June 28, 2019",Biting flies,3,"Fort Wayne, Indiana",2
Indiana Dunes State Park,"It was a hot and sunny day. We went to the Dunes and took my grandchildren, they had never seen abeach before so we drove 3. 5 hours to see the Water and beach and Dunes. They loved it!. Will bring them back again next. WE had a picinic and they thought that was so much fun.","June 26, 2019",Fun at the Dunes,21,"Bargersville, Indiana",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"My bottom-line is to skip the beach; go explore sand dunes and the marsh.This is the details -The Indiana State Park beach is overcrowded with limited facilities. Worse, the swarm of biting flies was simply intolerable. No amount of insect repellent would get them off your back. The only escape is to get into the icing water. Living in Chicago a block from the lake for 30 years, I have never experienced anything like this. Seriously, the 57th street (at the south side right off MSI) or Montrose beach (at the north side) with miles of soft sand is far more enjoyable than Indiana dunes beach.Campground - In contrast, the campground is clean and well maintained. We did not get any harassment from mosquitos nor biting flies. Although this a heavily used campground in summer months, the crew is vigilant in keeping the bath/shower house clean at all time. My only complaint is that, because each camp site is smaller than most other campground, you hear your neighbor campers' noises pretty well.Hiking trails - In my opinion, this is the star attraction of this park (and the nearby national park). Excellent trails with many lookout points. Many difficulty levels. In fact, I love the flat marsh trail the same as the rugged sand dunes trail. Although the boardwalk in Trail 2 was under repair on a recent visit, there are many other wetland areas to immerse yourself in tranquil nature.","June 24, 2019",Excellent campground; wonderful hiking trails; avoid the biting flies infested beach,27,"Chicago, Illinois",4

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I love the Dunes. We've been coming here for years to enjoy camping, hiking, birding, geocaching and picnicking. Over the years improvements have been made: totally reconstructed campground, a new Nature Center and even the front entrance was moved. The trails are a mix of bogs, sand dunes, prairie areas. We’ve hiked them all. Currently one trail popular with birders is closed and has been for sometime. It would be nice if this could be repaired and reopened. The 3 Dunes Challenge is still taking place. It’s an invigorating walk to the three tallest peaks: Mt. Tom, Mt. Holden and Mt. Jackson. You can go a bit further and complete the trail to the Big Blowout. The beach pavilion is undergoing controversial renovations. Plans are to place a wedding venue of sorts right in the middle of the beach. Should be an interesting mix of patrons. Parking can sometimes be a problem as can actual entry to the park as crowds surge for special events like meteor showers or the sand castle art. Annual passes are available to purchase which can be used at all state parks in Indiana. Well worth the cost if you enjoy nature in a safe environment. The Nature Center offers areas for kids, a library and a fantastic birding room. Programs are also given and a calendar of events is posted. Camping is also available with modern facilities. Picnic areas and shelters are scattered throughout the park.","May 31, 2019",Wonderful property to visit.,35,,5

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Who knew such beautiful beaches existed far from the sea! The dunes are so much fun and a great workout to run up and down. Everyone we met was super friendly and courteous to each other. Most of the dunes you can explore in your bare feet (as my kids did the entire time). We hiked the 3-dune challenge, which is technically in the National Park, but it's hard to tell where the state park stops and the NP begins. The challenge was fun, and took about an hour. It was definitely a challenge, but not unattainable by any means. You could certainly take as long as you need, and there are rest stops along the trail. I hiked it in my sneakers and got quite a bit of sand in my shoes. My husband hiked it in his flip flops, and they were unstable going uphill. My kids hiked it barefoot and would occasionally step on a branch or root, but no major foot injuries. The visitor center has free stickers if you complete the challenge.We also picnicked in the park, and there were plenty of benches and grills available. The picnic areas were clean, and spaced apart enough to have a little bit of privacy.

Indiana Dunes State Park is 47 miles east of Chicago. Designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974, it includes hiking trails and food trucks and Nature Centers, a beach house with concessions, an observation platform, a Visitors Center, camping facilities, picnic shelters and spectacular views.

Slow and steady wins the race! They are fairly tall and fairly steep but you are rewarded with some amazing views. Afterwards we went back to the Nature Center and looked at the exhibits. In the back of the Nature Center, they have some bird feeders and we saw a bunch of different birds and wildlife including a raccoon and a chipmunk. Then we cooled off in the lake. The kids had a blast. Once you get in the water about a foot, it turns from pebbles to nice soft sand. The lake is fairly shallow in the parts that you can swim, perfect for our family.There's some food trucks selling food, popcorn and shaved ice. Typical beach food of nachos, hot dogs, corn dogs and burgers. The beach has lifegaurds as well.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Together, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (operates like a national park) and the Indiana Dunes State Park offer unique opportunities to hike on trails which meander through lush green forest, desert-like sand dunes, and to walk along the beach along Lake Michigan. Each has a separate visitors center with exhibits and rangers. The national park does not charge admission; the state park does but Indiana residents get in for half price. They complement one another, though they don't seem to share much information. At the State Park, start with a visit to the visitors' center. An old but worthwhile film details the geologic formation of Lake Michigan, the dunes and the surrounding area, as well as the sociological history. A small but well done exhibits section features flora & fauna of the area. There are daily ranger programs. TIPS:If you're a hiker, do 3.5 mile Trail 9. First mile feels like the East coast with lots of trees & ravines, but then you get to spectacular dunes and Lake Views. Loved it! There's lots of hype about the ""3 Dune Challenge,"" where you hike 3 consecutive dunes to a height of about 195 feet. If you're reasonably fit you can do it and it's fun.

Took the family on a 7 hour trip with pop up camper in tow to Indiana Dunes State Park. $12 to enter for non resident and it was good for the 5 days we were there. Campground was pretty nice, electric only, no water, but there are water spigots throughout the campground. Bathhouses are big and nice. Well maintained. There are two inside the campground and was never crowded even though the campground was full almost every night. The 3 dune challenge was pretty intense but we conquered it. The Lake was crystal clear and very calm. Was never crowded and everyone there was friendly. We took about an 8 minute bike ride from the campground to the beach and just left our bikes there while we enjoyed the beach and nobody bothered anything. No salt, calm waves, no sharks, crabs, jellyfish, among other critters and crystal clear water, why go back to Myrtle Beach? The drive up from WV is an easy one at that. Two things we didnt like: 1. MOSQUITOES!!!!!!!! They're everywhere and at night its ridiculously bad, cant sit outside by the campfire bc of them. Even with candles and bug spray. Nothing stopped them.2. There was no good restaurants, just the same fast food and stuff like any other town has. No good vacation type restaurants. 3. I know I said 2 but third is fishing access. Lake Michigan has great fishing but not anywhere here that is easily accessible from the shore. Found one place in Portage but never even got a bite or saw one single fish caught.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We've been visiting beaches around the Dunes for a few years now. Last year we stumbled upon Central Beach. This has become our favorite beach of all. Every time I post pictures when we visit, everyone asks where it is and can't believe that it's in Indiana! Sometimes the water is turquoise blue and you'd swear you were somewhere else. There are no rocks at all in the water - just sand. The shallow water extends really far - which is great for taking kids.  They can safely play in the water without worry that they will quickly be in too deep. The beach is secluded by large dunes all the way down, so it really never gets very busy. Only warning - the parking area is small, so if it does happen to be a busy day, you may not find parking. You also have to walk a little ways from parking to get to the beach and down a dune. Not bad, but sometimes a little tiring if you are hauling a lot of stuff and kids. But well worth it. We usually try to visit during the week when it's not crowded at all and are able to walk down the beach to an area all to ourselves. This year the bathrooms have been closed and they are renovating them. Doesn't seem like they've made too much progress, so not sure when they will have bathrooms again. if you like quiet, great views and seclusion - this is your beach!!

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We paid the $12 out of state admission fee per car to go to Indiana dunes State Park. It’s very pretty on the way in; a lot of trees. We did the recommendation of a staff member at Indiana dunes. We drove to the nature center, and set out on trail number 8. This involved our going up to three mounts: Mount Jackson 176 feet elevation, Mount Holden 184 feet elevation, then Mount Tom 192 feet elevation. We had been advised to wear regular shoes; I don’t know what kind of shoes would’ve worked; I wore kind of a loafer that kept on filling up with sand. To go up these hills, we had to hike up in about 4 inches deep of soft sand. When we got to the first mount, Mount Jackson at 176 feet, we thought we only had eight more feet to go to get up to the second mount; but we found that the trail then goes downhill and you have to go back up again. By the time we got to Mount Tom, there was a “congratulations, you made it” sign at the top. What a work out! I have not sweat this much in years! After getting to the top of Mount Tom, we went back down the stairway to Mount Tom and picked up trail 4/7 to the beach. It was really nice to walk on the beach by beautiful Lake Michigan. Then we turned around and slogged up more sand again to get back to the main trail. We then switched to Trail 7, to go back to the nature center; that was called a Moderate trail, but there was again an uphill section and 4 inches of sand to go through that was a challenge. All in all, we were glad we did it and it was nice to see the beach and see the pretty, tree lined trail around the sand!

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We did family camping with our two teenagers just before July 4th. We been to Indiana Dunes, beach and dunes for hikes before. We never realized that if you are camping in Indiana Dunes, you can access beach without going out of the park. That is a big deal considering you might be waiting for hours during summer weekends to get in the park/beach. Camp sites were very nice. Paved parking. However sites are very close to each other’s, very little to no privacy. Most of the families RV camping. Only few like us were in tent. Toilets and showers very decent. Added bonus was after dinner, at night we went back to the beach. What a pleasant experience! Nice breeze and sounds of waves. There were few other families, some in water. I guess you can totally enjoy water in your own way in the dark. ;)If you love camping, this is a pace to checkout. Easy access to beach comes FREE with it.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"The beach/state park at Chesterton has a $12 entry fee per vehicle for non-Indiana residents. This seems to be the main beach for Indiana Dunes and is usually busy during the weekend. If you can go during the week, especially in the morning, you'll be able to find close parking in the main lot. The beach is large and clean, and is often busy, but if you're willing to walk, you can find your own spot away from the crowds. The bathroom and bathhouse are clean. There are venders selling various food items. It's a little hard to find, but if you find the visitor's center, you go past that and end up at the beach. We've been to a few of the Dunes beaches, and this one and the one at Michigan City are the best ones, in our opinions. West Beach is small and has a LOT of wood all over the beach, which is not safe for your feet. I wouldn't take young children to West Beach, but I definitely would take them to the Chesterton and Michigan City beaches.","July 11, 2018",Good beach and facilities,64,"Chicago, Illinois",4

Please bring food,shelter, chairs or everything that you think you can accommodate. We went during one of the busiest and hottest weekends with no preparation which is a big no no. Not many food options are available . Overall, the dunes are a must watch and offer a fun game to race through with your friends.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I live in Illinois and Indiana Dunes State Park is about two hours from home. It's like traveling to an exotic location for a mini-vacation. If you have only gone to the dunes on major summer holidays like July 4, you're missing SO much.The real magic of the park lies in its many mini ecosystems. You have the lake front - miles of nearly empty shoreline, perfect for finding fossils, geodes and beach glass. The marshes and swamps along Trails 2 and 10 are definitely worth seeing, with an array of reptiles and amphibians, not to mention water birds.The forests are pristine. Travel trails 2 and 10 and you'll probably see only a couple of people for miles. The quasi-desert trails - the top of the dunes on Trail 9 are amazing - lizards and cacti are common.I'm not a bird watcher, but there are many who visit the park to seek out the huge array of birds like green herons, great blue herons, migrating cranes, woodpeckers, swallows and so many more. This park is a wonderful place to get away from it all close to home. There is nothing like a five-mile hike to restore your equilibrium.Winters are also amazing - the shelf ice alone is worth seeing (but don't walk on it or you risk death).","July 6, 2018",More than just a beach....

We went up mainly to see the fireworks but the beach was really great. We went to the far west end where the crowd was lighter. You are farther from the restrooms but closer to one of the dunes. The fireworks show was excellent also. We took food for most of the day and they had food trucks later in the day. We assumed the traffic getting out would be pretty awful and it was.

It cost $12 for our car to enter the park (two adults and one child). We stayed until about 12, playing in the cold, clean water and relaxing on the sand. We climbed one of the dunes right before we left and the sand was HOT on our way up and down. By the time we left, there were a line of cars waiting to come in and parking was probably going to be a problem.

However, all the park staff were super nice, so I didn’t mind that fee. The beach is quite lovely and the dunes are an interesting feature.

It is not very clear, so park at the Nature Center. The trail starts in the forest. It is an easy sand path. At the fork, I recommend that you go left and embrace the best sand dune of the park, straight on! You climb up the back of it, and when you get to the top, you are in awe. It is a beautiful blowout dune, against the crashing waves of Lake Michigan. Looking out on the horizon, you can see the Chicago Skyline. Go right, and walk along the ridge of the dune, admiring that the dune is forever moving and evolving, and the sand is so fine. The trail then follows a ridge line, that you can see and hear the waves crashing below. It turns back into the forest, and you have a nice easy walk back. I went to a couple of beach lookout points in the park and the visitor's center. I would have liked the visitor center to have a video, or focus more on why nature has created such a special place in this part of Indiana, but unfortunately, it doesn't.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We took our preteen son for a short family camping vacation during his fall break. It was fun! The state’s website was difficult to work with on mobile devices, but we made do with reservations, selecting a camping site (they provide photos of each site!), and directions. Note that you pay a $7 park “car” fee in addition to your campsite fee.We picked one of the tent-only sites (#20), but some people pitched tents on sites designed for RVs. We might try that next time, as some of the RV sites had better proximity to trail heads. Overall, the sites were fairly tiny and very sandy. Remember, this area was underwater a few thousand years ago! You will likely get sand everywhere if you, your kids and pets are not careful. Yes, it is pet friendly.A surprisingly gorgeous beach was a short hike away, but the concessions building had closed for the season. There were still quite a few families on fall break having fun there, as it was still warm, but too cold to swim.In addition to the beach, there were several hiking trails. We hiked the “Three Dune Challenge” (3 highest points), which wasn’t terribly hard but included some very steep slopes. We visited the Nature Center and bird watched from their special glassed-in room.From there, we hiked the infamous Trail #10. This was akin to a forced death march, as it was the longest trail and was not well marked. At the halfway mark, we were dumped onto the beach where we hiked miles without seeing a soul. Along most of the beach, there was a high dune “cliff” preventing us from accessing safe ground. This created an occasional pinch point where you were forced to walk through some very cold and choppy waves. Had we known how miserable this trail was, we would have picked another. Be warned! :)Also note that no alcoholic beverages are permitted in the park, but there are a few restaurants/pubs a few miles away if you need a good craft beer or if you get sick of camp food.Our fellow campers were quiet and respectful, a sign that the park rangers are good at their jobs.

It is not easy walking though. It took us awhile to do the whole trail as we are not used to walking uphill in sand. The reward of doing the the 3 dune challenge was like I said earlier the views. Just remember it is not for the faint of heart and the whole trail is sand so keep that in mind.The campground was clean and so was the beach. We watched the sunset 2 nights on the beach which is a must if you stay overnight. Be sure to walk the beach and feel the soft sand. The restrooms on the beach was very clean and well maintained. The only negative I would say is that the bath house showers did not have any hot water in the women's side. At 1st I thought it was a fluke and that someone must have beat me to the hot water but the next night I noticed no one had been in the showers for sometime because all the stalls were dry and still no hot water.

On a whim, I decided to start the 3 Dune Challenge. Most of the trail is straight-up sand at a significant incline. It was sheer determination that got me to the top of Mt. Holden! I was tempted to take the shortcut back after Holden, but I continued on to Tom...it was a relief that there were stairs. The view and the self-satisfaction of finishing the 1.5 mile trek was well-worth the sweat and sandy mess.

They also had some food vendors set up in the parking lot. If your into gambling the Blue chip was a mere 20 min drive and the Horseshoe was 40 both were very fun. The one and only drawback was the garbage truck came around at 7 am one morning and basically woke up the whole campground.

Not very exciting. But just like a good book, if you stick with it, it totally gets better. Once I got to the ridge that overlooks Lake Michigan, the rest of the trail was very interesting. Sound of the surf, the beauty of the sand dunes, the uniqueness of a deep sand trail. All very worth it. Good hike.","August 18, 2017",Hiked trail #9.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I traveled to Indiana Dunes with my wife, our 10 year old daughter and our two boxer pups. We visited for about 10 days in mid July, 2017. A couple disclaimers about my review...One, we did not travel to Indiana Dunes just to travel to Indiana Dunes, if that makes sense. We're from St. Louis and our daughter was playing in the softball World Series in Crown Point, Indiana that week. We chose to camp in our hybrid trailer rather than stay in a hotel. We settled on Indiana Dunes State Park as our camping destination. Two, the weekend before our stay at Indiana Dunes, we camped at Van Buren State Park in South Haven, Michigan. It was my first time there, but my wife and her family go there every summer to camp. It just so happened their family trip coincided with our softball trip, so we were able to spend some of our time in Michigan rather easily with regard to logistics. From St. Louis, it was only an hour drive further than Indiana Dunes. Three, we aren't drinkers, so the no alcohol in the campground or on the beach rule wasn't an issue for us. Because of the experience in Michigan, my review is more of a comparison of the two parks, rather than an unbiased review of Indiana Dunes. Moving on...Indiana Dunes is pretty much right off the interstate, which is convenient. There is a town, Chesterton, a couple miles from the park (about a 5 minute drive). The town has gas stations, many fast food joints, a grocery store, and a laundry mat (the park doesn't have coin laundry). They also have a few sit-down restaurants. Our favorite was Octave Grill. It's a very small establishment, but their food was just delicious. I highly recommend it. The campground itself at Indiana Dunes was pretty average for a state park. No major complaints about the campground or staff. It is a very busy campground however. Because we didn't book our trip far enough out, we had to change campsites 4 different times during our stay because there was no single site available for the duration of our travel dates. That totally sucked, but I'll try not to hold that against them because it's not something that could be controlled. There were two bathroom/shower buildings for the campground, each having three shower stalls each. We tried to shower during off-peak hours to avoid lines, which worked for us pretty well. Their campground ""store"" was very minimal and you wouldn't think it was anything more than a storage shed had it not been for the sign. It had some camping staples (marshmallows, ice, bread, milk), but not much else. If you're looking for souvenirs, you won't find them there. Onto other aspects of the park...We only did one dune (Mt. Tom), because we had done a dune in Michigan and because of the softball tournament, we didn't have a whole lot of down time to really explore everything. That dune was no small feat. We're in moderately good shape and we had to stop a couple times to catch our breath. My favorite and most accurate description of the dune is to 'imagine climbing a mountain, only the mountain is trying to eat you'. You feel like you're on a treadmill because you keep taking all these steps, yet don't seem to be going anywhere. If you can do it though, the views are totally worth it. The beach was gorgeous. Being able to see the Chicago skyline was a lot cooler than I had anticipated. And man oh man, if you can catch a sunset there, please do so. Words cannot do it justice. Here's some of the gripes I have about Indiana Dunes...their beach rules are ridiculous, especially having been to Michigan first. You can only swim in a designated area that is marked with buoys. You cannot swim with any inflatables or other devices, such as noodles. That's right, no raft, no tube, no noodles, nothing. You can only swim when lifeguards are present. They don't assess the water conditions until 10:30 am, the earliest they report to their posts is 11:00 am and they leave their posts at 6:00 pm. Depending on the rip current, or tides or other weather, they may deem the water as too dangerous, therefore they do not report to their posts and you cannot get in the water. In that case, you can still set up shop at the beach, you just can't swim. They do patrol the beach and order people out of the water when the water has been declared unsafe. In Michigan (and at every other beach I've been to in my life), the conditions are monitored and a flag is displayed notifying beach goers of the conditions (green means good, yellow means caution, red means extra extra caution, etc.), then you swim at your own risk. I don't understand why Indiana Dunes cannot operate in the same manner. That being said, if you're traveling to Indiana Dunes just for the day, or maybe two, there's a very real possibility you will not be able to get into the water. I'd say the beach was closed to swimmers for about half of time we were there. I found the swimming between the buoy rule to be ridiculous as well. We stopped at the beach to rest after descending Mt. Tom, which was about a quarter mile east of the swimming beach. There was a family there playing in the water. Sure enough, some lifeguard on an ATV came down that way and ordered them out of the water. The section of beach they allow swimming on is pretty small in comparison to the amount of shoreline in the park. It's a shame they don't let people spread out a bit. At Van Buren State Park in Michigan, they operated on the flag system. You could swim from wherever you wanted. You could use inflatables and noodles. Much more lenient. They did have beach patrols in Michigan too, because alcohol was not allowed on the beach (although you could have it at the campground). Again, we don't drink so it wasn't an issue for us. Also, I'm guessing it's because it's further away from Chicago, but Van Buren's beach was less crowded. If you're still reading this...you're a quite a trooper, ha. In closing, I'd have to say I probably wouldn't return to Indiana Dunes, because of it's popularity and their rules, and knowing what Michigan has to offer just a short hour away.","August 17, 2017","Nice, but I'd drive the extra hour to South Haven, Michigan if I'm ever up that way again.",18,,3
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We started our visit at the Visitor Center on rt. 49. It has a gift shop (where you can get the stamps for the National Lakeshore). The gift shop also sells the stickers for the national parks. There is a small exhibit that was very kid friendly, and toilets. The guide showed us where to drive to start the 3 dune challenge.The drive was smooth and we parked. We started on path 7 but changed to path 8 to start with Mt. Jackson. DO NOT DO THIS! the light sand was deep and with every stride I only gained a few inches. The climb was steep and exhausting, treat that path as exit (down) only. Though my 16 year old is in shape and had little trouble. The rest of the route is much better though not for strollers or those with difficulty walking.The Nature Center is worth a look, my 9 year old enjoyed it, those younger would love it.After our climb, we returned to the visitor center for our stickers, pencils and postcards. there were t-shirts for sale also.If we had had more time, a visit to the beach would have felt great after that climb!","August 16, 2017",Read listing for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore also.,111,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",4

The visceral disgust I experienced that weekend long forgotten, I suggested the park this year, one non-July 4th weekend Saturday, only to be bitterly reminded of that earlier foray. Really? In eight years, you can't streamline the entrance process (at a minimum add an on-line option; better yet, how about shuttles from the convenient parking lot next to the visitor's center or a pedestrians-only walking path or a bike rental service)?? You can't add showers and restrooms? A LOT of people want to go to this beautiful beach, and the beach/lake are big enough and beautiful enough for all to enjoy--if Indiana would only invest a bit for the good of the 99%.

We carried a Camelbak with us and was drained dry. My husband wore sport sandals and faired better than we did in tennis shoes. They kept getting packed full of sand and our socks got thrown away at the end. The next day we took the epic trail #9. It was tough, but worth the effort. I think we completed in about 3.5 hours. I would've liked to take more breathers and enjoy the scenery in the woods, but the mosquitos and black flies were terrible!! Take bug spray!! Do not let the rugged label scare you away.

My son had never had such a close experience with a Great Lake before and he asked if I was sure this wasn't an ocean. LOL. There were signs everywhere advertising a riptide warning, too. I've read reviews here and there about this place and the biggest complaint seemed to be the industrial stuff in the distance (smokestacks at one end of the beach oozing smoke and Gary , Indiana's industrialness in the distance at the other) seemed to detract from the natural beauty. I totally undertand this point of view, but I felt it gave a greater sense of where I was in an odd way. I'm from Massachusetts and I'm the type of traveler who wants the whole experience, the whole , honest experience. It seemed like there was a certain level of honesty here that I was drawn to.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We camped at the state campground in our tent on site 16. I purposely pick the site because it has a dune right behind it- built in play sand for the kiddos! Though do note where you put your tent is stones not the best to sleep in on the ground! The campground was very clean including the bathrooms. The playground on our side was lame and not worth trying to find a site specifically to be near it though we saw the other loop's playground and it was much nicer wish I would have taken my kids to it. My only complaint is the campground charges an arm and a leg for very small bundles of wood and you're not allowed to bring wood in. A bundle is almost $7 and is barely enough to get coals to cook dinner not nearly enough to sit around a fire during the night.Both nights we went down to the beach and swam until sunset perfect time of day, not too crowded, plenty of parking, nice showers and plenty of space to spread out.Last day we did the Dune challenge. It says strenuous but in my book I've done harder dunes and hikes. My kids, 2 years old and 4 years old, did it 100% on their own. I would suggest going early we started around 8, saw only 3 other groups on the trail but by the time we left the parking lot was quite busy. Also I suggest doing it starting at the Nature Center and ending with the walk through the campground. That's how 90% of people do it so if you try to climb up the other way it's way more loose sand from when people run down the dunes and it makes it far more challenging. Also the Dune challenge Trail is wonderfully marked there is zero chance of getting lost or on the wrong path. We loved also the markers at the top of each Dune telling you the stats of what you just hiked. Also don't miss the small but very nice Nature Center with a room to seabirds and a cool ship for kids to climb on.Great family vacation spot!

Indiana Dunes State Park,I can't believe that my family has been coming here for years and this is the first time I have reviewed it.

Take time to do the Three Dune Challenge and make it a competition especially if you have kids (my 8 year old daughter beat me this year but I am planning my spectacular comeback). Make sure to take time and watch the sunset over Chicago; it is usually pretty dead during this time. Make reservations early (we do a year in advance).Other than that make sure to take time to learn the history of the dunes from the legend of Diana of the Dunes to the Ball Mason Jar Factory.,"July 10, 2017",Been coming for years and never reviewed,16,"Christiana, Tennessee",5

Indiana Dunes State Park,"This is an interesting place that combines a beach feel with the added flavor of nearby sand dunes. There are areas to hike, hang out at the beach, swim with the safety of life guards, and there are vendors nearby. The place is clean but it is strangely close to industry. it makes me wonder a bit whether or not the nearby industry effects the water. it does effect the view a bit. The water looked clean and the park was nice and clean though. For some reason, flotation devices are not allowed unless they are strapped to you like a life vest. The life guards had some flaky excuses why this wasn't allowed and they were probably repeating what they were told and didn't really know why themselves. The lifeguards were nice though and appeared to take their jobs seriously. There were park ranges on site and it looked like there were renovating the main building by the beach. There were also food vendors nearby. This is a good stop if you are in the area.","July 6, 2017",Family Trip Destination,28,"Alton, Illinois",3

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Firstly, this park is a fantastic bird watching park; we viewed the habitat of several varieties that I had yet to see in the area; we saw Marshland areas in full bloom, woodpeckers galore, and wildlife beyond our imagination! The best day, was the nature center visit; they were filming a TV commercial ... and we got to 'roam' around and be in that as well. What fun! Now, going in the spring, you can expect some storms and high wave activity in the region; this happened to us; the storms came through in the night, and, along with high waves, the beach was closed for two of our six day stay. Thankfully, the campground is protected by the tall dunes that the park is so famous for...hardly a branch swayed in the 65 mph wind speeds just on the other side of the hill! I was very thankful for this, and it was due to the natural design of the campground. At night, you can hear the lake in a constant stir. It lulls you to sleep.Now, back to the nature center; it can be reached by 4 trails, one is a short and easy walk from the campground, or, you can take several short or long trails to see the marsh lands and beaches. When the sun was out, about three of the six days there, most all trails that led to a beach view, and several had a wondrous view of the Chicago skyline! We had not realized you could see both Gary and Chicago from there. The staff was excellent! All helpful and full of laughter and smiles. Security made constant rounds and were very friendly as well. Some of the gate staff even hugged us when we left! You make friends there very quickly. The staff made us feel like they knew we 'didn't want to leave just yet' ... and we were welcome to return ASAP! We even met a couple there that we had met first in Brown Co State Park, nearly a month back ... and then, that same day, met another couple from Turkey Run State Park! What are the odds of that?Now, the couple that ran the General Store were very kind and helpful. There is plenty of firewood for sale in their barn, ice too. So, if you forget something, I'm sure they will have you covered. Tip: I make a packing list and add anything I needed or the things that I packed too much of, on the list. I rarely forget a thing ... and, I rarely over pack! The store owners knew the area well and were more than happy to tell us the best sites to visit in the nearby towns, especially when the 'rainy' day blues started setting in on us. Michigan City and Portage had a lot to offer;I-Max Theaters, Culvers, and even an Applebees. All well-maintained and clean cities to visit. To our best surprise, on the last day in the park, my 27 yr old daughter drove my 73 yr old mother, three hours to visit us ... for a beach picnic! The sun came out early that morning, and it began to warm up, just enough to spread out a blanket and enjoy time with my beloved family on the beach! It was a special kind of treat for us! Mother loved the beach and the trails were level and easy for her to walk, even though she used a cane. The sand on the trails made her more 'sure-footed' and she really enjoyed the marsh regions. She says she plans to visit us there again soon! Indiana Dunes State Park: It made quite the impression on us all! I would not only stay there again (facilities were clean and grounds well-kept), but, I made plans for reservations for a longer stay, next year!This park makes you feel like, the 'more the merrier'!","May 27, 2017",Spring Storms & Beach Picnics,1,,5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Reserved a spot for our RV at the Dunes State Park this week. We planned our stay the week before Memorial Day because of the excessive crowds. Let me say this, we had a beautiful spot close to the comfort station and trail leading to the beach. We did notice that some improvements had been made to the sites with the addition of new picnic tables (ours did not have a new one). Staff is very friendly at all the entrance points. We would like to mention that the garbage pickup on this trip at the dumpster sites was ""absolutely awful"". We arrived on Monday with two dumpsters absolutely overflowing by the comfort station. We mentioned it to the park attendant and they sent some people out to pick up what was outside the dumpsters...where were the garbage people? It took three days for the contractor to arrive and in the meantime the raccoons had a great feast every night. Also, during holiday times there is only one entrance into the park causing a backup for almost a mile. I wish people would let the park know more about these inconveniences and safety/health issues. We've never had a problem before but, 2017 seems to have hit a roadblock. We will certainly notify them of our displeasure.Mary M.Hobart, IN","May 25, 2017",Not so great this time around,91,"Hobart, Indiana",3

Indiana Dunes State Park,"This is a destination place to camp not a one night stand (like our stay). There is a lot to do here, from the hiking trails, to biking, to the beach on Lake Michigan. There are playgrounds for the kids, and a bathhouse by the beach. The terrain is relatively flat making biking a nice way to get around.The campsites are paved/ cement, off asphalt roads. The sites are level, with good electrical hookups. Unfortunately there are no sites with either water or sewer connections. The tenting areas seemed better than average, and the very clean restrooms/ showers were very nice. There is plenty of room (and grass) between sites, and enough shade to make things comfortable. There were a number of new picnic tables mixed in with some still usable older models.This is not an inexpensive place to stay especially for one night. $23 + $5 transaction fee (online) + tax = $29.61. Now, this would not be terrible for a night, but they nail you a $12 entry fee to get in the park (if you are staying multiple days, the campground car pass will allow unlimited returns). Amortized over a week or longer stay, the fees would not have the same impact, and the longer you stay the better the value.","May 23, 2017",Camping At The Dunes,294,"The Villages, FL",4

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Camped at Indiana Dunes State Park in early May for 4 nights so that we could also attend the annual Birding Festival. This campground is very nice. All campsites are level, paved and roomy, not crammed together, with electric service (30 & 50) but no water or sewer available at site. Water available upon entry and dump station available just outside of the campground. Sites on the north side of both loops back up to a large sand dune with trees and vegetation. This helps if there is a strong wind coming from the north over lake Michigan. Campground is fairly quiet thru the week and will be full on most all weekends, but we did not encounter any loud or obnoxious behavior from any campers. Very family friendly. Comfort stations are newer and generally clean, but starting to show their high usage. Campground roads are easily passable with no sharp turns or overhanging tree limbs. I didn't see any drive-thru sites. Bird watching during the festival and spring migration at this location is famous and we certainly spent a lot of time at the park and other bird watching hot spots. The boardwalk east of the campground and the observation tower west of the beach (up on the dune) were excellent. Trails at the Dunes are exceptional encompassing several differing topographies such as dunes, marshes, bogs, prairie and forest areas. It was too early in the year (and chilly) for us to take advantage of the beach, but we have visited this park during summertime and the beach is excellent and well kept. Views of Chicago's distant skyline is a must, particularly during sunset and nighttime. Nature center was nice and all state park personnel we spoke with were attentive and helpful, along with just plain nice. All of the state park grounds were well maintained. You will enjoy your stay here ... just be sure to reserve a spot early as this is a very popular park for camping and all other activities.

I was huffing and puffing the whole way -- it was a chilly day so it was definitely doable for my out-of-shape self. There are stairs to Mt. Tom so it doesn't seem as bad. You can see Chicago from Mount Tom. A vertical spot it the best way to see Lake Michigan. The nature center is nice, especially for kids. I was in the area for the birding festival.

The potential for bird watching looked really cool and would be worth a trip back.The line of cars to get in was really long so I would recommend getting there as early as possible. We visited in February so there are no bathrooms open and the pavilion was closed. You should plan ahead if you visit in the winter.

New bathrooms and external concessions are available. - While pollution in Lake Michigan is much lower than it was decades ago, the creek entering the lake near the parking lot is surrounded by signs warning guests to stay out of the water.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Having grown up in this area I have very fond memories of all the good times I had here, not only as a child, but as teenager. Later when I married we often brought our daughter here to spend the day playing in the sand and swimming. Now that I am older we spend time camping in their campground.I have to commend Indianas DNR on the wonderful job they do with most, if not all their State Parks. Clean, and well maintained they are a joy to camp in, hike, bike and swim. This one is on top of our list for all of the above. We are never disappointed in our stays here. Each site has a concrete parking pad and electric hook up. There is NO water hook up, but there are plenty of places you can get water at through out the campground. The restrooms are new, clean and bright. Playgrounds for children and paths that lead to the beach as well as the Nature Center.Being a big fan of Indiana's Park system we frequent them often and usually make our reservations online. The Check in is a pleasant experience. We are from out of state (even though I am a born ""Hooiser"" ;-)) and we have to pay a slightly higher admission fee, but its well worth it.There are many areas to picnic in, with shelters for inclement weather. Going to the beach is just a short drive away. The water and sand is clean, with a bath house and areas to buy food. Swimming is fun, walking the beach or hiking makes for a wonderful time.No alcoholic beverages are allowed in the park...and I like that idea. This is a place for families. I count myself very fortunate to be able to come here often.

So, I had to leave without walking on the beach, but they get one star for having public restrooms in a nearby wooded area. That's the only value I got out of my visit there. However, the story is not over. Hint: On my way out, I saw the entrance to the Indiana Dunes National Seashore, which I drove into absolutely free and actually got parking for the same beach. Free parking was scarce however, and an overflow lot was selling spots with again inflated rates for non-locals. Overall, I didn't feel very welcome in Indiana. If I were to open a vacation rental out in California, Hoosiers would definitely get a surcharge!","July 30, 2016",An expensive and unfulfilling rest stop.,10,"Hawthorne, California",2
Indiana Dunes State Park,The Indiana dunes lakeshore is actually several places. There are a number of hiking and jogging trails as well as a couple of beaches. The trails are great and well marked so you can choose the distance that suits you. The beach is nice as well but may get a little crowded on weekends during the summer. Lake Michigan can be dangerous at times and the conditions change quickly so pay attention to the warnings when it comes to swimming. It seems there are drownings every year but can be avoided by following instructions and using common sense. ,"July 29, 2016",Great hiking and great beach,39,"Valparaiso, Indiana",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"Beautiful little place. I could tell Indiana Dunes has seen its ups and downs. The main building is pretty old, not in service, boarded up.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"My family and I enjoyed the ""Three Dune Challenge"" and found the staff at the visitor center to be great (special thanks to Dennis for offering to take our family photo). We enjoyed the hiking, the scenery, and pretty much every part of the park. Once we arrived at the beach we were prepared for a great rest of the day, however, after an hour we left disgusted. After 20 min in the water a life guard starting yelling for people to leave our section of the beach and go crowd in with the already crowded section. All he kept staying was we had to be south of the creek. When I tried to ask why we were being moved he just kept saying we had to move. After another 20 min, people were back in the water, where we had been told not to be, and this time lifeguards on an ATV and in a boat were forcing people into the crowded section of the beach. The last straw for me was when someone over the loud speaker announced that no floatation device, such as a pool noodle, could be used in the water. After forcing people, including my 10 year old into the section with 20+ teenage/early 20 year old males playing water rugby and using more colorful language than I would like, we left and will not return. The lifeguards cared nothing about our experience, they were just doing as told and when I asked for some understanding of why all they could do was repeat that we needed to move. If you want to enjoy the beach I would look elsewise. We left and went a little further south to a public beach and it cost us nothing, plus I found it to be better than what we paid to deal with.","July 26, 2016","Stay for the dunes, go somewhere else for the water",12,"Cape Girardeau, Missouri",3

It is an open house during the posted hours, so you can walk through at your leisure.We checked out the visitor center, with the bird feeders and such. That was informative.Our favorite part was the beach @ the pavillion. Parking fills up fast, so get there early. I loved that there was no alcohol allowed on the beach, so it was family friendly. We'd never been to a ""lake like"" experience like this before. Bring your beach umbrellas and chairs and such. There are food trucks available for food purchase. Some people were tailgating at their vehicles with their charcoal grills. It is pay by the car load to get into the park. Well worth the admission.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Our first ever trip up here to the Dunes and we were pleasantly surprised. Pros -> dunes were much bigger than we expected, and huge bonus most hiking through the dunes is through beautiful wooded trails...very nice. Must do #3DuneChallenge. We completed it w our 7yr old daughter in about 2 hrs. Nice paved bike paths around park. Nature center was nice, as well as shower houses in campground. Park has very big shelter houses although we didn't rent one, they looked very accommodating for large groups or reunions. Cons -> very very busy park, beaches extremely crowded and NO ALCOHOL PERMITTED ANYWHERE IN PARK. We have never been to an Indiana state park with this rule, so that was a bummer. Campground sites were not that private..we prefer sites not so crowded with more trees for privacy, however we did a drive through and marked sites for future visits. Visitors center is outside park and we had to drive out to it...although if you have a bike a can ride on trail out there...just too far for my 7yr old to ride. Campground is not close to lake...you have to walk through woods to get to beach or drive...wish was closer.

Beaches are nice and with the addition of the restroom/changing area it makes it more welcoming to families. I'm curious how the banquet center will turn out.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Admission is $12 unless you're from in-state then I think the price was $7. That's cool that they do that, I'm not sure all National Parks do. There's a visitor center up the road a bit with plenty of info and rangers to help answer any questions. There are also maps and such you can pick up. There is a free state park area of the Dunes you can also take advantage of just, I guess, west of the National Park area. Small swimming beach but then the beach stretches way up around the lake. Lots of different hike trails to chose from. I went with #9 and then split off to #10. Whole hike took maybe 2-3 hours. Passed a lot of people here early that were jogging on the trails. Biggest complaint: flies. Bring bug spray. This trip was kind of impromptu for me and I wouldn't say I was prepared cause the flies attacked me through most of my hike. It really got annoying. But that's on me, not the park. Also I had checked the weather and a storm was due to roll in but not until much later in the afternoon. Well, seems this storm changed its mind and came in right when I got out of the woods and arrived on the beach on the #10 trail. Problem is when you get to the beach the hike down to the parking lot or to pick up the closest trail (#8) is a long, long way. So I was racing this storm, watching lighting coming across the Lake as I made my way back. It was at once really amazing to see but also being I was carrying camera gear and such and right by the water not the safest thing in the world. But again, that's on me, not the park. They have a few campgrounds with shower facilities (I snuck in, I know you shouldn't but after my hike I desperately needed a shower.) There is a camp store by the campgrounds for food and things. Also some facilities by the swimming beach. It's a really nice park. Great way to spend some time.

At the visitor center, there is a variety of information for using the beach, hiking, etc. We visited the beach at this park on a day after a cool front had blown through overnight. Despite the cloudy skies and the cooler temperature, there was still a 40 minute wait to pay the $12 fee and enter the beach area. Upon arriving at the booth to pay the fee, there was a sign stating that there is no swimming due to riptides. The beach area is nice and is comparable to a mid-Atlantic beach. On this day, the wind was blowing fairly hard out of the NW. Standing by the lake, it was chilly without getting wet. On this day, the lifeguards patrolled the beach to make people stop swimming. The water was rough and none of those swimmers looked physically capable of swimming parallel to the beach far enough to survive a riptide.There are different concessionaires near the large building on the beach. There are also changing rooms and restrooms.

Have supper done and cleaned up, all garbage taken to the dumpsters, coolers locked in your car, and go to the bathroom before dusk! The first night we were there my husband was just finishing up cleaning supper, put the trash bag down, turned to pick a piece of trash off the table, turned around and the trash bag was running across the road! They are very loud at night too, hissing at each other, lucky we had a fan in the camper to drown the noise out. We woke up the next morning to find out some tent campers didn't put there coolers away, even though their kids were ""playing"" with a raccoon earlier that night, they had broke open the cooler and shredded all their food.That being said.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"With its nature center, explanatory film, plentiful parking, trails to suit every level of fitness, and beautifully clean beaches, this park is a ""must walk"" for anyone traversing Northwest Indiana. The towering sand dunes cap off the natural beauty, and when atmospheric conditions are just right, it is even possible to see sun glinting off the larger skyscrapers across Lake Michigan in Chicago's Loop. Sadly, the park also is the site of one of America's most frigid ""cold cases:""Fifty years ago (July 1966), 3 young women from suburban Chicago climbed aboard a boat at the main beach -- and were never seen again. Retired police detective and photojournalist Dick Wylie devoted his life to solving the case, and he has. Anyway, Dunes State Park is terrific, and it is very easy to access from the South Shore interurban RR station at Dune Park.

Campsite was in the back of the campground loop closest to the path to the Nature Center. 30 /50 amp electric option. Closing to vault toilet but no smell. Had water across street if you had a long enough hose, you could refill tank. You pay $12 to get in the access point to the park but once you check in, the campground tag will allow access when you venture out of the park and re-enter. Water filling stations easy to use. Sewer dump in across the street from campground entrance does not have the water filling option. Vintage RV rally weekend was a very cool bonus. However, I witnessed (2) campers with reservations get blocked from their sites by folks parking in their campsite and leaving. Park folks could only relocate. The sites do not have a place to ""tag"" your reserved space. Wonder how often this happens.... Great bath houses, shelters and easy access to beach.

The entrance fee to the park is a bit steep for non-residents ($12) when you consider you have to pay that even when paying to camp. But camping prices are comparable to other areas. The campground facilities are relatively modern and well cared for. There also are small playgrounds for kids in the campground.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Wife and I camped in a travel trailer at the Indiana Dunes State Park for 4 nights during the annual ""Birding Festival"". The campground is well maintained with level, paved sites that can accommodate large and small campers. No water or sewer on each site, but electric is available. Cell phone and TV not a problem. Each site has a fire ring and picnic table. Ample trees for shade on most sites. Two comfort stations are newer and cleaned daily. A few other pit toilets available throughout the park are also newer and clean. Camp store was not well stocked early in May and man who runs it was grumpy and negative towards campers.This is a fairly large campground with over 130 sites and can be crowded with families and visitors, especially during the weekend. Camp sites are nicely spaced apart, but there is also no privacy separation between sites. If you are looking for quiet and solitude/privacy, this campground might not suit you. Very social campground. Beach is very nice, dunes and trails are worth experiencing along with the nature center and picnic areas. All areas were clean and tidy during our visit. Lots of people using the park for exercise.One frustrating drawback is when entering the park. There are two lanes available for campers/visitors, but only one lane is generally used so getting into the park can be problematic during peak entry times (after 3pm and on weekends). Several times there were 5-15 vehicles waiting to get in to the park. It would be nice if the DNR would staff the 2nd lane during these peak times to allow re-entry and annual pass vehicles quicker access.None-the-less ... this is a beautiful and very popular park.

We will be coming back around Memorial Day possibly when it's a little waemer and can walk a little further. You can see Chicago on a clear day which it was.

There is plenty of space on the beach to spread out but if you don't like crowds don't come here on a busy weekend. Also if you don't get here early on a busy weekend the line to get into the park can backup all the way back to the freeway and the line does not move fast.

We drove around on the 1st day (Saturday) for half an hour trying to find a parking place.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We just returned from a weekend camping here. We have camped here several times in the past and we've always had a good time. We will NEVER come here again in the summer! Fall camping here is wonderful!! We were lucky, (we thought) to get a cancelation for a site. We got site #79, right by the gate and store. The site is backwards, our RV door was on the left, the fire pit and sitting area is on the right. So we could not use the fire pit b/c our slideouts were too close. There was not enough room on the other side to move the pit. There was a hugh drop off on the left as well, not safe at all. There were 4-5 sites around us empty so we walked to the gate and asked if we could move and explained why. Of course, there wasn't any available. The next day, the same sites were still empty so we asked again. The sites remained empty the whole weekend. We were told by a friend that has friends from Chicago, that they and several other people from Chicago reserve sites throughout the entire summer, just ""in case"" they decide to use them, then they will have them. They don't bother to cancel so other people can use the sites. Nice. I have 3 recommendations for site #79. 1- Make it a pull thru site so RV's can use the space, fire pit and picnic table. 2-OR, clear out the brush on the left side of the site so the fire pit can be used on the correct side. 3-OR at the very least, on your website, put in comments that this site is recommended for tent campers or pop ups only. These suggestions would cost little or nothing at all. The other reason I will never camp here again is the long line you have to wait in to get into the campground. The beachgoers and campers all have to wait in the same line and you could be in line for over an hour! They need to have a separate entrance to the campground!!!! And the beach is WAY too crowded!","August 23, 2015",Disappointed in summer camping,37,"La Porte, Indiana",3

The area of the beach we camped at wasn't as busy as the main portion where the life guards and field house was located. Pretty clean and everyone that day was nice just enjoying the water.Many people kayak, boating and jet ski I'm sure rental is available we just didn't partake. Also there were two small lots for free parking maybe between the two it provides 60 spaces. So come early! The road to the beach is narrow so take your time. There was no food options near us so you would have to google or walk over to main beach for a food truck if available.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"The Good: cheap, clean, good parking, unusual location, historicalThe Bad: Industrial site in the distance along the lake short, you see a cross section of the nation (not a problem from me but some people would rather not rub elbows with folks in the bottom 20%)This is a great inexpensive way to go to the beach. It's an easy drive from Indianapolis or Chicago and there is a light rail direct from Chi. The beach itself has nice medium grain sand. It stretches a great distance so even when the parking lots are full there is still room near the water. We have gone twice, both in early August. The water temperature is a little cool but not uncomfortable at this time of year. The water is not crystal clear but you can see about 3 feet deep. The verge along the beach has small rounded stones instead of sand and it drops off to about 4' pretty quickly. There are sand bars about 30 feet offshore where the depth is about 2'. The dunes themselves are a neat little hike. All of the sand is fairly loose so any walking is burning a few extra calories for you. The terrain is really unusual for this part of the world with forest, huge dunes and the lake all together. I am not someone who likes big crowds but I never found it too much. Major beaches in the Carolinas or Florida are much more crowded.

At 8am there was a high school team out training and running, a very loud group of guys training for the Marines (along with all the expletives) and LOTS of others trying to get a good spot on the beach. We wanted to hike and hit the beach, but we skipped the beach altogether because it was PACKED. I seriously can't express how packed it was. We decided to do the 3 dune challenge and that alone was worth the $12 we paid to get in. It was rough for my 10 yr old because of the heat, but he enjoyed it overall. My husband and I loved it.

There are toilets and changing facilities along with showers to wash off the sand.

When they were at the bottom and couldn't climb out , on garbage day the truck would come and they would be disposed of into the truck. Occassionally the park wardens would leave big tree branches inside on an angle for them to crawl out.....but then campers would just take the wood to burn at their campsite.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Growing up in Southwestern Michigan, I often visited Warren Dunes State Park in Sawyer. I never visited the Indiana Dunes until this visit. I only had about 3 hours available, so I asked a park employee to suggest a trail that was moderate in difficulty and where fewer people went. He suggested Trail 9, which was a great trail. It included dunes, forest and a view of the lake. At far end of the loop trail, I hiked down to the water to put my feet in for a few minutes. Be sure to wear a hat, and beware of super hot sand when it’s sunny and hot outside. If you have more time, consider Trail 10 that includes some marsh land and a bird watching stand as well as a long hike along the lake’s edge. The binoculars for bird watching at the stand are old, dirty and unusable. Swimming is allowed only in the designated swimming area. I didn’t have time to visit that area, but I suspect it’s among the busiest part of the park.

I noticed a few people on the beach had beer/mixed drinks so perhaps they got it in before the rangers were checking.

Highly recommend the walking paths; check out the state site for challenge levels; ask the rangers at the state park site for help and be sure to use the visitors center outside the state park to learn about the history of the Dunes and what there is to see and do. Even my husband with the bad knees had no problems walking the paths.","July 23, 2015",Beautiful land formations; nice for a weekend if you aren't a birder,17,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We went to the beach and had a great time. the water was very clear and there was a fun area where the river came into the lake. Kids enjoyed playing on the beach although the beach was very different from the east coast which is what we are used to. There were a couple of food trucks with hot dogs/ice cream, etc if you didn't plan ahead and bring food. The old building that they are renovating near the parking lot is beautiful.","July 17, 2015",Cheap family outdoor fun,34,"Bluffton, South Carolina",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We enjoyed our three night stay here. The sites were ample and clean. The beach was gorgeous and the water of Lake Michigan was soooo blue! It blows my mind seeing waves and sand but not feeling the salt on my skin. The water was too cold for me to get in but my children had no problems. The cons of this park are that there are no water hook-ups, the mosquito were pretty vicious, and the park attendants thought it was a great idea to close the showers for cleaning at 8pm or so - right in the middle of prime bathing time. Why not do it at 2 in the afternoon? Anyhow, other than these things we found the park to be lovely. Oh, and my two sons and I did the 3 dune challenge - if you're fit go for it. We saw some nice wildlife (baby foxes) at the end of our hike. :)","July 15, 2015",Great Park,154,"Houston, Texas",4

We arrived what I thought was early and had to wait about 15 minutes to get into the park. As this was my first beach experience with Lake Michigan, the water was very cold. Even though we got there early-ish we found a place right near the water to spend the day lounging and sun-bathing.

We were passing through the area, and I had read about their 3 Dune Challenge in a travel magazine and thought that it would be fun to try. We enjoyed the one and a half mile walk and picked up our free postcards and stickers afterwards for completing it. We also purchased fun t-shirts. My only disappointment with the challenge was that we could not see the beach or the water during the walk. The entire challenge is through the woods. We did drive to the beach and walked along the water. It was very pretty.","July 12, 2015",Enjoyed the 3 Dune Challenge,211,"Lake Charles, Louisiana",5

I can't comment on a lot because all we ended up doing here was the 3 Dune Challenge. It was fun and not too difficult. The weather was unseasonably cool for July so the heat didn't bother us, but if it is very hot part of the trail is through trees & would provide some relief. There are several steps to climb after the last dune. Afterwards, stop back at the visitor center to get your free sticker.","July 12, 2015",Do the 3 Dune Challenge,40,,4

Indiana Dunes State Park,This was our first trip to Indiana Dunes State Park. Our initial impressions were that the park was well laid out with excellent access roads and nice looking facilities. There are 2 campgrounds for car camping as well as a group camping area. Each campsite had a paved parking area and a concrete pad for a trailer or RV. We thought that the sites were a little small by our standards (Ontario Provincial Park sites are on average larger) and for the most part too open (little or no privacy.) There were nicer sites in the campground but they still offered little in the way of privacy. The restroom/shower facilities were nice but a cleaning schedule would upgrade them from average to very good.Indiana Dunes offers several hiking trails to explore this beautiful natural attraction for every level of expertise from easy to challenging. Unfortunately for us weather prevented us from taking advantage of these features so I can not report on them. Beach facilities were clean and monitored by lifeguards. Currently the Pavilion (circa 1930) is under renovation and so we were unable to explore it.Our overall impression was that it was a nice park and we would like to return when the weather was better to permit a more extensive exploration.,"July 12, 2015",First adventure into Indiana,8,"Cobourg, Canada",4

It took about forty minutes waiting in a car line to get to the parking lot for the beach. We WERE there on July 3 which is of course a holiday weekend. They have life guards. On the west side of the beach, you could swim that day. On the right, no swimming. And it must have been a pet friendly beach. (Which I am fine with but may be an issue for others). There was a food truck that was awesome. So they redeemed themselves by allowing the food truck in to the park. Beach was packed but clean.","July 8, 2015",Interesting,63,Indiana,3

Although there are factories lining the shore, you can also see Chicago on a clear day. It was very much like being at an ocean beach. There is currently construction being done on the pavillion.

During college we took a trip here to see the incredible variety of plant and animal life present. Everything from fossils of aquatic plants 150 million years ago to cactus and interdunal ponds can be found here along with the greatest variety of birds in on spot I can think of. A lot of effort to conserve this treasure has been invested and a very active group of citizens watchdogs the area to protect it.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"May 2015 was my second consecutive year to travel to the Dunes (from Hawaii) to do some serious springtime birding (bird finding with a purpose). The trails are extremely user friendly, well marked and well maintained. There's enough space that I never felt crowded, and often I was in solitude. The Nature Center was another jewel, not to be missed. I'm a novice bird watcher and it doesn't take a lot to get me excited so 63 species in two and a half days was a fabulous trip for me.About half the people I met were not there for the birds but rather hiking, walking, dog walking, boy scout trip, or getting a head start on summer on the beach. A nice outdoor space for families and young children, even at least one playground I saw. The Visitor Center is a great resource with maps and lots of helpful pamphlets, as well as a video of the history and significance of the Dunes. The Dunes is a little over an hour from O'Hare airport or South Bend. A Place in the Woods is a fabulous B&B to stay at in the area, and the owners are nature lovers and have a lot of really helpful information re. the area.","June 2, 2015",Fabulous place for May Birding!,6,"Kaneohe, Hawaii",5

Indiana Dunes State Park,"If you like hiking and if you also like to walk on the beach, this is one heck of a place for you. I visited this place early October so the trees were not changing colors yet, but the whether was very nice. I was there for two days and one night and absolutely loved it (of course since it is lake Michigan, it was windy during the night) I planned to be by the lake shore for the sunset and it was beautiful. However if you plan to do the same, you need to be prepared to return to your campsite from the lake shore since it will be more than 3 miles away and after sunset it will be completely dark in the trails. There are several trails with different lengths and difficulty which you can choose from but the beauty of this place is the uniqueness of the trails. You are not hiking on regular soil. It's sand and it feels so different.There is an entrance fee which is very usual and the campsites are very clean.

We also hiked the 3 Dune Challenge - 2 out of shape adults and 2 eager teens - it was challenging, but well worth the experience. Trail is almost all sand so plan your shoes accordingly.

It is dog friendly, with dogs on leashes. The park will be investing major funds to refurbish the Pavillon Building for the public, providing many amenities, such as a restaurant. At present it is not open, but it does house public restrooms. The park is a short drive to Chicago or Michigan, no more than an hour on I 94 with no traffic delays. The South Shore Commuter train also stops in the area. I helped coordinate a gathering, ""The Chicago Welsh Terrier Walks"" to meet here.

The park itself is nice with all the dunes and trails to go over them. We couldn't see the lake very well and only got our legs and feet wet due to the cold water, but it's a nice park and good place to getaway from Chicago without having to travel far.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I have lived 2 miles from Dunes State Park for over 20 years. Others have focused on the beach, so I will focus on what I go to the Dunes for - bird watching and trail walking. Indiana Dunes State Park is a great place to experience nature fairly close to metropolitan Chicago. The park has a fairly extensive trail system - so flat, some hilly, some more open, some in the woods. Not only are there sand dunes, but there is an extensive marsh within the park, so that altogether there is a fairly wide diversity of habitat. It is, without a doubt, one of the best bird watching spots in the entire Midwest. Spring is a great time to watch rivers of migrating birds along the lakeshore from a dune overlooking the lake, or walk the trails for warblers and other neo-tropical migrants. Lake watching is also good in the fall and winter, and there is always something to be found out on the trails then, too.","February 18, 2015",Great Place to Experience Nature,86,Indiana,4

The park has a camp grounds, nature center, and numerous buildings that you can cook & eat your meals. Trails are plentiful from simple to rugged and length from a 1/2 mile to several miles. Plenty of parking and during the summer months lifeguards are on duty. If you are in the area it is definitely a attraction not to miss!!!!

Allow time to enjoy the waterfront before/after the hike too. The trail passes the nature center so you will have access to restrooms. The challenge to climbing Mts Tom, Holden and Jackson (all around 176 -192 ft) is in the sand of course! Stairs are provided on parts of the uphills.

Our boys (11,9) had a blast playing in the lake 'canal'. We stayed overnight in Chesterton, and went to the dunes on Sat and Sun.

The kids all loved the Devil's Slide and they played there for over an hour (hiking up and running/sliding/falling down). The climb up is a doozy if you aren't in shape, or even if you are. The slide made for some great pictures of the kids. The dunes make for a very good photo background.We also walked on the boardwalk.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I only gave this park one star so that people will be more inclined to look at this. The park is great and I love it and want to keep it great. BUT!!! people using the park and beaches here have to be aware that dogs are REQUIRED to be on a leash! I like dogs and I don't care it you use a leash until your wet sandy mutt mugs me while I'm trying to enjoy the beach and the peaceful solitude I can find here. I have been mugged by free roaming dogs 3 times this year while just sitting on a blanket minding my own business and reading on the beach just to the east of the trail head at Trail 7. This is why there is a leash regulation at this State Park!!! In the first two incidents, the owners tried to call their dogs back but the wet sandy mutts still jumped all over me and my blanket and gear. At least their owners tried to call them off and then apologized. The latest incident was this past week. Two women were walking FOUR dogs, none of which had a leash or even collars. All four animals stormed over me and trampled me and my blanket and gear. One of them even went after a sandwich I had in a paper bag next to my backpack. These women didn't even attempt to subdue the animals or have the decency to offer any apology. I confronted them and told them that the dogs are supposed to be on a leash. They argued and claimed ""this is a ""dog park"" SIR!"" Everybody reading this please understand that yes, this is a ""dog friendly"" park but there is still a six foot leash regulation (even in the water!). I have now entered the Indiana Dunes State Park DNR ""immediate violation report"" phone number into my cell phone and the next time this happens I will not warn you or speak to you, I will call the DNR and report you.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"This summer I finally was able to visit the Indiana Dunes State Park. It's a great day-trip from Chicago as it's approx 1-1.5 drive from the city (depending on traffic and where in the city you are beginning from). The highlights to me were the trails themselves, and there are miles and miles of trails to follow so it'd be impossible to do them all in a day. I primarily did two trails in a loop (Trail #4, and #7), which includes the climbing the highest dune (Mt Tom). **note, it's much easier approaching Mt. Tom from the south (inland side) rather than from the North (lakeside)Also, I am in relatively good shape as I work out, eat healthy, have a healthy weight, but even still, the dunes can be strenuous and I was surprised how winded I was not only walking up an incline but doing so in sand. So be cautious, go slow, and don't try to see too much. The one part of the park that left me disappointed was the beach. It's a nice sandy beach, but I was generally disappointed with the lack of facilities. There's a decrepit building housing bathrooms and an awful cafeteria (definitely bring your own food). Coming from Chicago the purpose of visiting the park is for the dunes and the hikes and NOT for the beach. There are plenty of beaches in Chicago that get the job done. I'd love to return in the future to continue hiking some of the trails I missed as it's always nice to get out of the city and have some nature.","August 23, 2014",A nice daytrip from Chicago,49,"Lansing, Michigan",4

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I have driven past the sign to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore dozens of times on Highway 94 between Chicago and South Bend, Indiana, but never took the time to drive a few minutes north to see the sights. This time, I pulled off and spent a few hours wondering through a wonderful park which is part national park and part Indiana State Park. The park is spread along a wide swath of the shore of Lake Michigan and includes dozens of large sand dunes, many so covered with vegetation that it is hard to realize that they are massive piles of sand until you walk them. I took path 8 in the State Park, which is called the Three Dune Challenge, a 1.5 mile loop that runs up and down the three largest dunes. The climbs are very steep (40 degrees at times) and involve climbing in soft, shifting sand. Path 8 is a great work out and you will be rewarded with endless views of Lake Michigan and the surrounding area. At points, you can even see Chicago across the southern edge of Lake Michigan if that's your thing. After the rigorous hike, take the path down to the beach and enjoy a well-deserved dip in the lake!

Too bad they don't keep the building up as lots of peeling paint and looks like it has had better days. The kids loved the sand. The food vendor was a bit slow and seemed overwhelmed with the menu of burgers, fries, hot dogs, brats, and chicken sandwiches. Best to bring your own food.

Expected forecast rain, so we dressed in layers with rain gear and day packs with snacks, water, and room to discard extra layers. The weather was unexpectedly sunny. We did the loop, mostly trail 10 along the lake (walking in the sand and wading in the water) and back along the backside of the dunes, climbing the three dune ""mountains"" that were open to the public. We investigated part of the boardwalk on trail 2, with a lovely marsh habitat, but the water level was still high on May 3, and the boardwalk was partly under water halfway through so we turned back. Went to the bird observation deck which overlooks the marsh, well worth the visit to see the scope of the marsh and the variety of birds. Wide variety of microhabitats from beach to woodland to marsh. Visited the Nature Center, which I wish had more literature for sale. Our experience was enhanced by a visit to the Indiana Dunes Visitor Center at the corner of highways 29 and 49, with its exhibits, free brochures, and the book we bought titled The Indiana Dunes Story: How Nature and People Made a Park (the two short natural history chapters were very interesting).

We're not an outdoorsy family, but found it a great challenge and lots of fun. The views from the top of the dunes were great. We started at the beach and hiked to the nature center which had great exhibits, a bird watching area, air conditioning, clean bathrooms and a water fountain. After resting a bit and enjoying we hiked back to the lake along an easier path, and then waded in the cold water - felt great. The 2nd day we spent in Valparaiso.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We are beginner RVers and chose to take our first trip to Indiana Dunes State Park, there is a 2 night minimum which I didnt quite like because we were only planning to stay there for one night but we decided to go for it and spend some extra time there. The campground is really spacious and for a first time RVer it was great to have some room to maneuver and park the RV into the space. Everyone gets plenty of space and the sites are separated nicely but close enough to not prevent interaction with fellow campers. All the campers were real friendly and lots of kids around riding bikes and playing which gave us a really sense of comfort knowing that we have a little one coming up to be of the same age as the kids we saw playing there.There is an electric hook up at the site but the water station and the dump station is near the entrance of the campsite but convenient enough. The restrooms and showers were decently clean , the morning rush ofcoz ame with some dirtiness but that was to be expected. We always had the RV to fall back on so no big deal. The beach trail is right of the park and its just about a 10 minute walk taking you right to it. The beach is really awesome and can be easily mistaken for an calm ocean if you ignore the fact that you are right in the middle of America :) and the fresh water instead of the salty water. The beach was fairly crowded but still had plenty of room to stretch out a blanket and get some sun. Overall it was a really great experience. Why only 4 stars ? There is a ban on collecting kindling from brush , a restriction on what wood you can burn and yet the wood they sell at the camp store is wet. That is pretty much the only negative I have to say about this place.","July 27, 2014",Great RV campground,42,"Bloomington, Indiana",4

Indiana Dunes State Park,Wife and I along with our two kids 7 and 4 came here for a short trip to the beach. We were overly surprised at the size of the beach. Tip to visitors is to get there early to grab you a spot. We came on a Friday and it filled up fast. Only reason for not a 5 star was the lack of changing facilities but other than that a 4 hour drive to the beach beats a 12 hour to the ocean.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We recently visited Indian Beach over the 4th of July weekend, even living in the Chicago suburbs we had never made the 90 minute drive before, and enjoyed our time there thoroughly. The beach is huge, and guarded by very attentive life-guards (perhaps a bit over-zealous?), and even on this busy holiday weekend we were able to claim a spot of sand right by the water for swimming and sand-castle construction. We were struck by how cold the water was, which while it posed no problem for our 4 year old, caused mom and dad to enter the water more slowly ;-) They warned us at the visitor's center, and there were signs around the beach pavilion to beware the biting flies, but we were prepared with bug-spray and didn't have much of an issue with them. Overall we were very pleased, and will be visiting again soon.Notes:• Admission to the state park, or National Lakeshore, is free but parking is not. Its $5 for Indiana residents, and $10 for out-of-state folks.• Only Coast Guard approved life jackets are allowed, no flotation devices or watercraft (boogie boards included).• The pavilion looks a bit run down, but does offer snacks on the ground floor and basic burgers/hot dogs in the second floor cafeteria. Your best bet is to bring a cooler and just enjoy lunch on the beach.• Dogs are prohibited from the main beach, but just to the east is a dog beach and your furry friends are welcome to play in the waves.","July 8, 2014","Large sandy beach, cold clear water, and biting flies",65,"Naperville, Illinois",4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We needed to kill some time after visiting some friends earlier in the day on 4th of July weekend. We knew it would be busy, but ""pretty busy"" also means ""pretty dirty"". It was $10 for a car load of people to enter the park; $5 if you are in state. When you pull into the parking lot, you are met with a large two story building well past it's prime. Actually, that was the best part because we were able to go a guided tour with a park employee that explained the history of the building and their upcoming efforts to restore it. Let me just say ""good luck. Peeling paint, broken windows, shabby tables and chairs and a ver limited snack bar. We saw pictures of h ow it was a real show place inteh 30's and 40's, but after all, that was last century. It was early evening (8-ish) when we got there. Still lots of people,overflowing trash cans and trash on the beach. The staff appeared to be minimal and overwhelmed just keeping up. If you look west down the beach, you have a lovely view of the slag heaps in Gary. Really. Your view to the east is much better. It was a good place to spend some time and if you ever get the chance to come back when the pavillion is done, it may be worth your while. However, for now don't be sad if you can't fit it into your schedule.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"You need to start at the visitor center and get a map, and maybe directions, and then don't feel bad about stopping stray park personnel and asking again. This park is put together from lots of fragments interspersed with private and commercial property. We got lost and backtracked twice trying to follow the origional directions we got to the old homesteads. When we found them they were worth the hike to go in and see. It is a self guided walk in the woods. Mosquitoes were thick in the bottomland between the parking lot and the old 1830's homestead. We worried whether we were still on the right trail, one of the trail marker signs said 05 miles 9 as opposed to 0.5 miles). We liked the beautiful walk and the old homesites.There is a good, typical beach area that has the usual beach picnic and sun and play options, east end of the park just before you get to the state park.

There was no swimming allowed that day, but we visited the nature center and had a nice picnic lunch. We walked through part of the campground, it looked pretty nice but the sites are small.

When we left we swung by the beach where the lack of care was again apparent. The bathhouse is in severe need of TLC (peeling paint everywhere and in abundance, no light in the upstairs bathrooms, no concessions like stated and the downstairs bathroom was flooded).

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I've lived within 15 miles of IDSP all by life. We spent many a hot summer day at the beach, or hiking. I've camped & picnicked there also. It's a beautiful state park, arguably the most beautiful in Indiana. Lake Michigan is the main attraction. Lake Michigan, as with all the Great Lakes could be an ocean sea (except for the fact it's freshwater). It doesn't have tides, but it DOES have rip currents. During the summer swimming season the beach is closed to swimmers when the wind is in the right direction because of these rip currents. It's no joke & every year people (usually teenage boys) die when they swim anyway & get caught in them. During the winter ice shelf forms along the shoreline. People are tempted to walk out on the ice, which can extend for many yards (or in some years miles). DON""T DO IT! For the locals who live by any of the Great Lakes know it is a death wish to stroll out on them. This state park was established in 1925. It's not to be confused with the National Lakeshore, which was established in the 1970s. It was done mostly to save the Dunes, which were in the process of being destroyed by the steel mills moving in. Development also played a part. The steel mills which I've noticed many visitors deplore due to the eyesore they present; have been the economic savior to The Region. At the East end of the park, down the beach the structure you see is NOT a nuclear reactor! It's actually a cooling tower for NIPSCO, a regional power company. The Dunes has many very good trails, most of which can be made into loops. Trail 8 is most definitely rugged, so take your time! There are wetlands in the interior of the park. Trail 2 combined with trail 10 is a favorite. At the beach, there's a pavilion that houses a gift shop & refreshments in the summer. There are lifeguards in the summer also. They are VERY strict & it pays to listen to them. They are trying to keep you alive during your visit! Keep a very close eye on your kids also. Drownings are all too common. There's also a nature center, which is the best we've seen in an Indiana State Park. This is next to the campground. The campground was recently redone with brand new bath houses. As usual, choose a perimeter site away from dumpsters & pit toilets (there are 2). There are NO alcoholic beverages allowed at the Dunes State Park, including the campground.  There are numerous picnic areas, including Wilson Shelter, which I've spent many a time with Scouts & family enjoying the outdoors. At one time they rented cross country skis there, but that was a long time ago.  The Calumet bike trail is right outside the gates of the park, & it's a nice ride. 9.2 miles & they are improving it every year. The South Shore train is also within easy drive or bike ride to the station. Chicago sightseers will have an easy time taking the train in, instead of paying an arm & a leg to park in the city. The National Lakeshore is another attraction & you go by the Visitor Center on 49 on your way to the state park. They can hook you up with info. Hope this helps! Have fun :)","January 8, 2014",Beautiful State Park,456,"Westville, Indiana",5

After supper we took a free, ranger-led sunset hike up Mt. Baldy which was GREAT. Our guide (Nick) was very knowledgable and added a lot to the experience. We had sunset views of the Chicago skyline and the East Pierhead Lighthouse; enjoyed watching the bank swallows.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"To be fair, this park was actually rather interesting. We went in the off-season so we didn't expect much. ""Not Expecting Much"" should be my mantra from now on when visiting attractions such as this one. The NPS visitor’s center is great. Nowhere else can you gather more brochures for places you know you'll never visit than at this visitor’s center. The rangers/cashiers were nice (heck, I would be too if I got to hang out in a brand-new empty climate-controlled visitors center all day talking to no one but my comrade-in-arms about how lousy the pay-scale is for rangers). The movie they showed was so informative and well done that my kids were asking to go home as soon as the show ended. In their little minds they ""saw"" the park, hence no need to go any further. I recommend saving the film for when you leave so you can compare and contrast with the real park.The dunes were cool. It was a pleasant late-winter day. The odd thing is that there are large bellowing factories flanking either side of the park some miles in either direction, yet not a single offensive fume was detected. Strange. Perhaps in northern Indiana's perpetual economic misery, the factories really aren't manufacturing anything but water vapor so as to at least present the illusion of economic health. Still as my kids splashed in Lake Michigan ankle deep I couldn't help but look at the factories, then at my children, then back to the factories and again to my children and then back to the factories wondering ""..They better only be spewing steam!""Apart from the occasional weekend dad and his sullen child, the park was deserted. Very nice. Climbing the tallest dune right next to the closed-up bathhouse was a treat...for perhaps someone who is in shape. I almost had a heart-attack chasing my kids up that sand pile. My thighs now resemble Popeye's spinach-pumped forearms. Thanks Dunes. Now I need orthoscopic surgery on my knees.Traversing back down Mt. Sand was slightly more fun. All the while as we slid down I had this sinking feeling that I was SINKING. After nearly losing my shoes to Mt. Sand's merciless maw, I struggled and wormed my way out collapsing at the bottom to the sounds of ""Can we do that again Dad?!?""As for the wife, I believe she was swallowed up by Mt. Sand, because neither hide nor hair of her was seen once we began our descent. She finally reappeared somewhere in the campground...changed.After picking up the missus, our driving tour of the campground was nice. Everything seemed to be in order gearing up for the season. After my knee surgery I think we might come back to camp.It is a lovely stark place that seems so out of place given the urban rot that stinks up the rest of northwest Indiana. I'd call it an oasis, but it's more like a natural fortress, holding back the blighted horde of urban decay and crime with its impenetrable mountains of sand.

There's a path that meanders up to the top and the view from up there is gorgeous. Our kids always have fun running down the huge dune, but the hike up can be tiring.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Indiana Dunes National Lake Shore/State Park is my favorite beach to visit, and as far as I'm concerned, the only beach! The view is absolutely amazing as on a clear day you can see the complete skyline of Chicago. Looking West, you can see more industrial sites like Gary, then to the East, a power plant. Not to be concerned, the area is protected and painstakingly beautiful. Even in the middle of July, the water is still much colder than anticipated, but always a welcome chill. I highly suggest the march up Devil's Slide, one of the larger dunes. It can be daunting, but the view from the top is unreal.Before coming out, check out the DNR website to see if there are any special events going on that visitors can partake in.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We stayed at Indiana dunes campground in our motorhome for 2 weeks. On the way into the park, no one mentioned the location of the dump station, and there was no sign pointing the way on our way in. We assumed that it was inside the campground. Nope, we had to go back out of the campground to dump before parking. The dump station is sloped in a way that it is hard for a MH to dump good. It is graded so the low spot is even with the dump, so the wheels of the bus were not in the groove, leaving us angled up hill. It would have been nice to know where the dump was (signing) as we had been on the road and needed it first thing. The campground has 50 amp electric only hookup. We have a surge protector and it never detected any problems with high or low power. We had a water jug to haul water and an 18 gallon black waste wagon. though we used the well maintained bathrooms often, there were a few trips with our waste water hauler to the dump station. The dump station is not easy to get to with a waste wagon. They need to install a sidewalk over to it since you have a choice of the road (longer distance) or a path of bark and mulch to pull the wagon through as a short cut. Firewood was poor quality. It was $6 a bundle and was so dry rotted it would not burn well. The park is completely paved with large roomy sites and good drinking water and reliable electric service. We walked many of the dune trails and spent time on the beach. Once you pay the $10 state park entrance fee you are good for the duration of your stay.","June 25, 2013",Could use a couple of tweaks,21,"Pensacola, Florida",4

Take the time to walk East on the beach and follow the marked path up the side of Mt. Baldy.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"My wife and I, a couple both around 60, hiked the West Beach Succession Trail in the National Park. It is the shortest trail in the area, less than a mile long, but hiking on a sand dune is not quite the same as hiking on solid ground. The flyer provides good information about how the dunes were created, and the signposts along the path point out natural features described in the flyer. The trail includes the beach area, which looked very nice and had some ""sun"" bathers, even on a thoroughly overcast day with a high in the very low 60's. There are two other trails in this area, which we had considered, but the arrival of rain as we finished the first trail ended our hiking day, as well as the stays of the beach crowd.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We normally spend a lot of time in the southern part of Indiana. We started coming to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore a couple of years ago. The entire area has so much to offer that we will be making many more weekend trips to discover it! It is a pretty and interesting as the southern part of the state. Even in the fall. The DNR and National Parks Dept have done an amazing job with the entire area - much improved from what I remember from years ago. The Indiana Dunes State Park is fabulous. Trail 9 was listed in USA Today as one of the top ten trails in the US. It will not disappoint you. We did this trail in the fall and it was lovely - the day was clear and we could see the Chicago skyline in the distance. We recently stopped there on a cold day in early April and did trail 8 which goes over the tops of three dunes; we warmed up pretty quickly. The beach is always nice and we did notice that dogs are now prohibited. (and should be) . It looks like the DNR has done a bunch of recent improvements by adding addtional picnic areas and walking paths. We are excited to go back for trail 10 which is 5.5 miles and includes the beach area. Can't wait for warm weather just to be able to hang out on the beach. While we don't camp anymore, the campground looked really nice and appeared to have been recently improved. Stop by the National Park visitors center. It is a very nice facility. Great place to pick up info for the entire area and clean bathrooms. After spening the day out and about a nice place to eat on US 12 is Bartlett's Gourmet Grill and Tavern.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"It's the only real natural preserve for hours around... not that there isn't precious nature everywhere.. but there is something about a national park, for all the warts of government service, they generaly do a nice job, and have the money to save the biggest blocks of land, but this one is a bit of a patch work, albeit pretty in small doses, but you do hear the humm of the industry that the compromise in the 60's preserving this place had to allow for.. you might forget it climbing to the top of the dune at west beach and seeing chicago in the distance, as there is a tranquility and the beach is impressive like any, but it is an odd patchwork amongst steel mills, that are actually quite busy right now, so it's kind of a funny park, but nice enough. if you combine it with the state park, it's a big enough area to make a dent.. if the steel mills and power plants weren't so visible they might be easier to not notice, but you see this sweep of beach with a cooling tower in the distance, but for me it reminds me of the opening scene of the blues brothers, filmed just to the west here, so all in all, you're glad they preserved at least part of what is and was a cool natural area.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"The conduct of an Indiana Dunes State Park ranger during our recent stay well illustrates how petty authority all-too-often creates petty tyrants.We arrived at the park at 12 noon in a torrential downpour after a long drive from Iowa, which involved the arduous task of navigating our trailer through Chicagoland's expressways. Hence, I wasn't overly tolerant of the general ineptitude displayed by the young girl in charge of registering campers.She certainly seemed under-qualified for even this less-than-demanding job, and I was by no means the only camper expressing exasperation by her slow pace and overall lack of efficiency. She seemed far more concerned with discussing arbitrary procedures about where I could and could not stand while attempting to register in a cloudburst, or why she could not register us until 2:00 pm (something NOT made clear when we made our reservations, I should point out), rather than offering any reasonable suggestions as to what we should do until she was able to figure out a situation that had totally flustered her.Losing patience altogether, my wife and I drove to the water station to fill up our tank and find our camp site. Seeing that the previous occupants had left, we backed our trailer in, intending to rest for a few minutes and then go back to the booth and register after the rain let up. Shortly thereafter, a ranger stormed up to our trailer and hammered on the door in a state of high dudgeon. My wife answered his imperial summons, at which point he began reciting a lengthy and overheated litany of complaint against us. This proved to be a rambling, utterly incoherent and exceedingly distorted version of events as they had actually occurred.His indignant attitude -- which would have been more appropriate to scofflaw hooligans rather than respectable paying customers upon whom his employment depends -- suggested that we were gatecrashers intent on sneaking into the camp, although we had made our reservations and paid for them in full a month earlier. He expressed great outrage over the injustice he felt we had inflicted upon the site's previous occupants by not waiting until 2:01 to park our trailer, even though they'd obviously broken camp before we pulled into the site. Incidentally, they left behind trash on the ground and a still-smoldering campfire -- which somehow did not seem to upset this ranger nearly as much as our alleged offenses.This bumptious fellow was obviously very impressed with a sense of his own importance as a guardian of the gates of civilization against the onslaughts of the barbarians, defending all that is Good, Beautiful and True against the Forces of Darkness. He became increasingly exercised as he warmed to his tirade -- which included the threat of expulsion for hurting the feelings of the young girl at the registration booth -- my wife had the temerity to quietly and politely clarify a certain point in his long-winded monologue. This audacity so incensed him that his bullying harangue rose to an even higher pitch of hyperventilation.He huffed and puffed his mustache at my wife's perceived impertinence in a manner that would've done justice to a Nazi camp guard. Indeed, his authoritarian bombast suggested that he might be altogether at ease in an SS uniform (his less-than Olympian physique notwithstanding). At that point, it wouldn't have surprised me had he had lined us up at attention and threatened to put us on punitive work detail cleaning latrines.Afterward, we were sorely tempted to drive into Chesterton and procure a quantity of the Verboten alcohol to sooth our troubled spirits. In trying to decide which fictitious character best invokes this particular ranger, we concluded that he would be most accurately depicted as a combination of Sergeant Schultz (of ""Hogan's Heroes"") and Yosemite Sam (of ""Bugs Bunny"").And with regard to the evils of the Demon Rum ... I'll confess we were unaware that consuming a beer or two could be so destructive to the Dunes' oh-so-fragile ecosystem. However, in any case it's always charming when senior citizens like ourselves are treated like seventeen-year-olds. It made us feel young again to have to sneak a six-pack past the grow-ups!We did manage to derive a sour sort of mirth amusing ourselves by counting the number of times we saw the word ""NO"" printed on signs and pamphlets throughout the park (which lacks only klieg lights and razor wire to fully complete the ambiance). Given the Spanish-language warnings alongside those in English, one wonders at the absence of signs emblazoned with the heading ""ACHTUNG!"" in capital letters. If that ranger is a representative example of the park's hierarchy, then perhaps in order to give prospective visitors a more realistic set of expectations, this park should be renamed ""Stalag Duneland""","October 14, 2012","Seemed like a good idea, but . . .",28,"West Des Moines, Iowa",1

Indiana Dunes State Park,"It is rather coincidental that this stretch of lakeshore has a national park designation (technically it's not a national park...but it's managed by the federal park service). When you climb one of the hills there is a sign that says ""born out of compromise,"" and the text below explains how in the world a national lakeshore is surrounded by huge smokestacks and a power plant. At one point U.S. Steel, a company, decided to buy a lot of land in Indiana on the lakeshore. Some senator wasn't too pleased so he worked out a deal: some of the land would go protected area. This became the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.I think there are two important distinctions to be made in reviewing the Lakeshore. The first is a review of the pre-beach area, or the dunes. These were quite cool. I would give them 4 stars. You could walk around for an hour or so in these. Someone told me in the winter you can do cross country skiing and that will definitely be on my mind as a weekend trip from Chicago when it starts snowing again. Then there is the beach. Like I said, there is heavy industry in plain view. I don't know about you, but that just kills it for me. It's a normal beach, nothing really special.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I'm from the area but now live in Arizona. Yet I love coming back to my Indiana Dunes. I can enjoy the National Lakeshore (which is an area partly on the lakefront) and the state park, but both are fee areas. Now that I am out-of-state, I pay $10 to enter the state park to hike the pretty trails, well worth it to see the dunescape develop over time.But if you want to enjoy the lakefront for free, I recommend parking at Kemil Beach just east of the state park. The access point is off ""East State Park Road"" off US12. The parking area does fill up fast on weekends, but here you can walk to the beach and head west along the lakeshore for 3.2 miles before hitting the old 1925 Beach Pavillion. The Pavillion serves food and drink during the summer season and provides rest rooms. Lifeguards are on duty here, but it's peaceful with few people away from the beach in either direction. Dogs can enjoy the sand away from the official beach area (just make sure you carry poop bags!) and there is some solitude. Here is where I also enjoy collecting sand stones with holes in them. Walking to and from the pavillion is a nice workout. On a clear day you can see Chicago's skyline 30 miles away across the lake.However, with the park fee you get a trail map that takes you to some wonderful bogs; pines, elms and maples dot the forest and all kinds of flowers and bird enlighten you.","June 23, 2012",Know where to go to enjoy the lakeshore for free,182,"Sierra Vista, Arizona",5

Our big problem was that the $5/car entry fee blossoms to $10 if you're from out-of-state. This does not seem like a good way for Indiana to encourage tourism...but we paid it.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Indiana is quite proud of its lakeshore. There is a state park as well as the national lakeshore. The beaches are sandy, the water in Lake Michigan is fresh and clear, though usually chilly. The sand dunes are fun to climb up and down, although kids with short legs are going to have trouble staying upright. Luckily there are plenty of easy pathways if you want to stay out of the dunes.Besides beaches, you can take the walking tour of some historic old farmsteads, or hike the wooded areas. The South Shore railroad has a station right inside the park. The Lakeshore Visitor Center is new and very helpful, but it is located on the state road just south of the park entrance. I'd recommend stopping here first for a map and to talk to the park rangers, who always know what's going on in the park and can give you advice on your visit. The day we were there, the ranger recommended that we visit Mount Baldy first, because parking is limited and will fill up quickly on weekends.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"During a recent business trip I had a chance to visit several areas of the Indiana and Michigan Dunes during evening hours.Other reviewers have posted excellent comments but here are a few more. Go to the visitor center first, even if it's out of hours. I arrived five minutes after they closed but just inside the entrance lobby (which was still open) you can get a map of the park as well as a map of the State Park (which I did not visit).I agree with the other reviewers that Mt Baldy is not worth the visit unless you are stretched for time. Yes, the views are nice, especially the sunset but it's highly visited and you cannot climb the dune as in the past - visitors are loving it to death. Instead I highly recommend travel just about 20 miles into Michigan to the Warren Dunes state park. There you can climb Pikes Peak which is almost twice as tall as Mt Baldy. See my other review for Warren Dunes.I also visited the West Beach area. There is no entrance fee between Labor Day and Memorial Day. I hiked the Succession Trail which is strenuous with 250 steps but had wonderful views of the lake and Chicago off in the distance. The trail has a boardwalk for about half of its length. My only disappointment was that it's meant to be an interpretive trail, but the trail guide in the kiosk at the start of the trail did not tell what the different markers represented. I would have enjoyed the trail much more if I'd had the guide. I even tried looking it up with my iPhone, but there was nothing posted online that I could find. Children might either love the trail because of its meanderings, or hate it because there are so many steps up.I also visited the Inland Marsh Trail. There were only a few mosquitoes on this windy and cool May day but I do recommend bug repellent. The trail was peaceful (no other visitors) but not terribly exciting. It was flat and easy to walk however. Children would probably be bored although I enjoyed looking at the different species of trees, flowers and shrubs.","May 18, 2012","Don't bother with Mt Baldy, West Beach excellent",575,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",4

Indiana Dunes State Park,"First time visitors should start at the visitor center on Indiana Route 49 north of Chesterton and I-94. Although the state park (entry fee) is older and remains popular, the national lakeshore is more expansive and diverse. Areas within the national lakeshore are free except the West Beach unit where a user fee is charged during the summer season. It's more than 20 miles between the Lakeshore's western border in Gary and its eastern edges at Michigan City Indiana. Browsing each park's web site prior to visiting may be time well spent even for those already familiar with each park.Hiking trails in the parks vary in difficulty and most are easy to moderate. Climbs to the top of the highest dunes are strenuous. Each park has a guarded swimming beach (summer season) and limited access natural areas. Since ""the Dunes"" is part of the glaciation that created the Great Lakes and much of the Midwest region's landscape, both parks offer naturalist led hikes, programs and special activities. Each park has a campground with provision for tent and RV camping. Neither park has provision for dune buggy or other off road recreation.On holidays and hot summer days parking lots may fill by mid-morning. Day visitors, mostly from Illinois, begin leaving after 3PM. Late afternoon and evening visitors are mostly from surrounding local communities. The major visitor areas of each park are very family friendly.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"Several years ago some friends told us of the great time they had visiting the Indiana Dunes Area. Being from the Midwest i filed it in the back of my head, on the list of umm..maybe someday. This past week, looking for a quick get away I decided to give it a try, and am so glad we did..sorry that we never went sooner. The Dunes are amazing! It was evident as soon as we got to the area, every person we encountered was friendly, helpful and just treated you like a friend. We went first to the visitor center, where we were told where to go for the absolute best view..Mt Baldy. Being our first time, we took the hard way and traversed the sand trail to the summit, very hard....but well worth it!. The view of Lake Michigan from the top is better than anything I ever encountered on either cost. Miles of pristine sand and crystal blue waters as far as the eye can see! The Beaches are natural and unspoiled, there are no giant Hotels and swarms of people dotting the shoreline, just nature and a smattering of other nature lovers! We went to The Indiana Dunes State Park Main Beach, The Beverly Shores Beach and Mt. Baldy, each one was just as beautiful as the last. I was glad to see that there is simple Beach access at all, since one time climbing the Dune itself was enough!Besides the amazing beaches the area has restaurants galore. We had just a short trip so only tried one, Wagoners Ribs, which was amazing. We do have several others on our ""next time"", list.There are plenty of quaint shops in the towns surrounding the Dunes area, antique shops are everywhere! For those wanting a more urban shopping experience there is a great outlet mall in Michigan City as well as all the ""regulars"", Target, Kohls, Walmart etc.. Personally we didn't go to any chain, restaurant, store etc, as we can do these anytime and wanted more the local flavor. The area also has historical sites, art galleries, dinner shows etc. The only drawback that I found is there is no central ""strip"" type of location in any of the towns that we saw. Because of this driving is a necessity. We were there in the off season however so maybe there are more ""touristy"" friendly set ups come summer. I do know that the town of Chesterton has a European style Market, every Saturday, beginning in May..so we are anxious to go back and see that.The hotel that we stayed at(covered under separate review) SpringHouse Inn, was wonderful! Beautiful older Hotel, clean comfortable room, free Breakfast, central location and wonderful staff! The price was a can't be beat 50.00, we will definitely be back! Overall it was a great experience, reminiscent of the type of resort community seen in movies like ""Dirty Dancing"", I am sure we will visit for many years to come. As a Midwesterner, I am glad I can now visit the ""ocean"" in Indiana Dunes, the ""Mountains"" and ""Vegas"" in Branson Mo and the Ozarks, and I have just been informed that the ""Dunns River falls, Jamaica"" clone is right in Kentucky. Cahokia mounds in Illinois, is close to Mayan ruins ...All this with no passport, no TSA, no long travel line and less than a tank of gas away!

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I'm going to focus on the Indiana Dunes State Park, which is a three-mile park situated within the far larger Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. First, the National Lakeshore has many great hiking trails that would take days to fully explore, stretching from Miller Beach on the east side of Gary on the west to the huge Mount Baldy sand dune at the western edge of Michigan City. The State Park offers some of the most dramatically beautiful hiking trails I've ever witnessed. While the traditional marked trails in the woods or along the beach are the most taken, it's the trails up on the ridge lines that provide killer views of Lake Michigan and also offer some of the most serene sights in America. From the main entrance to the State Park, (there is an entrance fee), walk along the beach 20-30 minutes east and then climb atop the dunes, where you can follow along for quite some distance before you have to come down because the trail discontinues. The views are exquisite of the blue water below.However, if you want the most sublime views, go to Kemil Road at the eastern boundary of the State Park and park in the National Lakeshore parking lot, (which is free), about a quarter mile from the water on Kemil. You'll walk Kemil along the fence closing off the State Park and enter when you get to the lake. Walk west about ten minutes along the lake and then climb up on the dunes. There is a path that follows the crest of the dunes around a number of blowouts, which is where the wind eventually pushed the dunes far away from the lake. The view from atop the further recesses of these big blowouts, over the rolling smaller dunes heading towards the lake and culminating with the crystal blue backdrop of Lake Michigan is the stuff of poetry on a clear, sunny day. You can walk for well over an hour from this direction. You can also do the same thing from the west, but you have to walk about 90 minutes from the State Park pavilion before you get to the eastern trail ridge atop the dunes.The views from atop either of the ridge lines (but particularly from the east entrance off Kemil Road) are mind boggling. That we can have such beauty so near the industrial crescent to the west and the sprawl of Michigan City to the east is a true blessing.","February 7, 2012",A little bit of paradise just a horizon away from the steel mills,39,"Chesterton, IN",5

Indiana Dunes State Park,"I've been going to the Dunes since I was a little boy and absolutely love them, especially in the spring and late fall after most of the campers and swimmers have departed. I don't go for the beach (which is insanely crowded in the summer months) but for the hiking trails and views of the shoreline. This is among the most lovely places in Indiana (right there with Turkey Run State Park), with sweeping dunes, large swaths of forest, and many hiking trails through forest, marsh land, and along the coast of the lake. You can easily spend several days here hiking all of the trails, although the marsh trail (I think it's #2) is probably the best. Sadly the boardwalks have gotten a little beat up over the years, and could really use some repairs. I think that hands down the best time to visit is late September / early October when the leaves are changing. If you enjoy photography, there are so many excellent landscape opportunities, with the sweeping dunes and striations in the sand caused by wind, the color of the trees, the lake itself, and of course the sky.There are some bike paths as well, but all of the hiking trails are off limits to bikes, so you really have to ride out of the park to get any distance cycling. The park is very near the South Shore train station, so you can easily take the train from Chicago (or South Bend for that matter) and hike into the park. Definitely one of the best outdoors attractions within an hour and a half from Chicago.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We stayed at the Indiana Dunes State Park for over a week in early September and this is possibly the nicest state park campground that we have ever visited. While there are no full hook-up sites, we would definitely return for another extended stay. Weekends are understandably busy and the park is guaranteed to be bustling with activity. During the week, though, we felt like we had the place all to ourselves! The spots are large, well-spaced and easy to get in and out of (even with a large rig). There are ample, modern bath and shower facilities that are very clean and very well maintained. Water stations are scattered throughout the grounds for easy refills. The campground has more than ample places to walk/potty your dogs, if you've brought them along to share in the fun, too. Please remember to clean up after them, though! Regrettably, a lot of people did NOT clean up after their dogs and that is not only irresponsible, but just plain rude. People who don't clean up their pet's waste ruin it for those of us who do!Besides the actual ""needs"" of campers, there's plenty of fun to be found in the park! Awesome hiking trails for the dunes and beach are accessible from trail heads along the campground edges. Some of the trails are really really difficult so pay attention to the maps which describe them. Climbing Mt. Tom from the beach side just once will really make you regret not paying attention to which trail you're on and where you're going! The park roads are also great for long, relaxing bicycle rides. A grocery store, Big KMart, gas stations and a nice selection of restaurants are easy to get to and within 5 minutes of the park (head south on SR49 to the Chesterton area). Campland RV is 10 minutes away should a repair or last minute, odd RV item be needed. They have a well-stocked RV supply store but their prices are kinda high. If it's an item that you really need right now, though, you're just gonna have to suck it up and pay.I have no complaints and will definitely visit the park again.

So, it was long pants and a hike on the trails. The trails were beautiful and warmer than the beach. Of course it is really walking on sand, up and down dunes, even though it looks like a forest trail - so be prepared for hiking in sand. Trail 8 is very challenging. The state park facilities are older and not in great repair. The campsites, which we did not use, looked to be the best part of the developed areas. Our hike was longer than expected (a poorly marked trail and a reconstruction of a trail area kept us from completing our loop as we'd wished). Despite the unexpected weather and trail derails, we did enjoy a truly scenic part of Indiana that we will return to.

Indiana Dunes State Park,"We just returned from a long weekend trip to INDIANA DUNES STATE PARK. The campground was one of the best we've visited with level, paved pads, nice playground areas, and recently renovated comfort stations. We were on site #112 which backed up to the dunes with a huge grassy area for the kids to play. We participated in a ranger-led interpretive hike one morning that was worthwhile. The park is conveniently located a mile from the Dune Park train station to Chicago, and just a few miles from Chesterton offering lots of restaurant options (try Gelsosomo's Pizzeria!) and groceries. The only complaint with the campground was the rates charged by the campstore for firewood; $7 a bundle seems quite high when they're trying to reduce the spread of EAB.Located adjacent to the NATIONAL LAKESHORE: Beautiful!

Great way to incorporate education and fun in your travels!","October 8, 2009",Awesome weekend trip to the Dunes!,10,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"The Dunes were nice. I would not mind going back again. The campsites are nice new cement throughout the campsite for parking spots. They won’t let you bring wood in and they make you pay $12 a bundle for wood, which seems too high for me, so keep that in mind. You are also allowed only two cars on a site, so if you have more you have to park in the overflow, even if there is room for your car on the site. Once again seems like a bit of a rip off to pay to park, but then you can’t park on the campsite and have to walk to the overflow lot. There are also nice convenience centers with showers and toilets, they are very clean, only one downside. They only changed the toilet paper once a day when we were there, so by the evening the toilet paper was always gone….in every stall. The hiking is different, so be prepared. Lots of sand. The trails are nice, but not marked that well. There are a few trails like trail 9 and 10 that lead in to one another and if you are not very careful you end up walking about 3 more miles than expected. (This mistake is even hard to prevent with a compass) The areas by the swap (trails 8, 9 and 10) can be very muddy, so watch out for that and snakes. The beach is AWESOME. Beautiful view, you can see the Chicago skyline and the sunset is really neat to watch as well. We did not have the chance to swim, but the water looked nice and refreshing.","May 23, 2008",Girlfriend Camping Weekend,19,USA,3
Indiana Dunes State Park,"This is a great place to bring the family!They have two playgrounds. One is more updated than the other but it really covers a good span of age groups between the two. One is great for toddlers and young kids and the other is great for older kids.The camp sites are clean and have parking pads. Very roomy, you do not feel like you are on top of each other. Trees everywhere. Plenty of shade and nature. Speaking of nature they have nature center with all of the trail info and more!THE BATHROOMS are fabulous! New. Clean. and HEATED!The trails are amazing and I haven't even told you about the beach yet! It is a walk but worth it. you can even drive right up to the beach if you have small children. Hope you take the time to go. I was really impressed.","November 14, 2007",Great Campground!!,3,Valparaiso,4
Indiana Dunes State Park,"We picked up a travel brochure at a rest stop and saw the dunes listed. So we decided to detour a bit off of 80 and check them out. We stopped at the first entrance to the National Park (Mt Baldy (I think). We parked and proceed to walk along the sandy path to the dunes. We came to a fork in the path, one way was to the beach (of Lake Michigan) and the other to the summit (it said steep strenous climb). They were't kidding, it wasn't so much the height, but trying to climb up it in the sand. It was rather amusing watching my family slip and scurry up the mountain of sand. I believe it said it was 192ft at the highest part?? We got to the top and were very pleasantly pleased with the breath taking view of Lake Michigan. The kids wished they would have had their sleds so they could have slid down the dune. We were surprised to see so many waves on the lake. If it had been a little warmer we would have liked to test the water. There are lots of stops along route 12 to check out the park. It was worth the while to detour and see these amazing dunes.","May 22, 2007",Awesome Surprise,58,"Mt Airy, MD",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,"This is a combined area. You have the National Lakeshore and you have the Indiana Dunes State Park. For some reason the State Park is not listed. They have a day beach, a train station that goes to Chicago, and camping. Unlike the National Lakeshore the state park is pet friendly. No dogs on ""swim"" beaches, but dogs are ok on leash everywhere else, and on the non ""swim"" beach areas.  ---------","July 11, 2005",The State Park is the place to go,11,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Indiana Dunes State Park,The Indiana Dunes State Park is a great place to take your family hiking. There are so many different trails to choose from! We enjoyed the climb up Mount Tom. (WHEW!)
