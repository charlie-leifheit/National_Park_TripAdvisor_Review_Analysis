Brooks Falls,This was a bucket list place for me and it didn't disappoint...the opportunity to photography these animals were just unbelievable...a dream come true...if your into national parks then this is a must see...I might have to go again because it's just that good...just be careful and follow the rules as you might walk up on a big bear...,"September 23, 2019","Bears, Bears Bears Everywhere...",2,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Brooks Falls,"We wavered back and forth about paying for this excursion because it is SO expensive. We are sooo glad we did it. We went in September and were told there wouldn't be as many bears as in July, we saw four bears at the falls and one in a lake on the walk back to our plane. I wasn't expecting to see any salmon either, but we were pleasantly surprised that occasionally, one would jump. The ultimate event happened and we saw a bear grab a salmon out of the air with her mouth. It was an amazing moment.Having said all that: I'd like to give one caveat to potential visitors coming with a float plane service (we used and were happy with Steller). After the walk to the viewing area, you put your name on a list and have to wait down stream for your turn to get to the main viewing platform. This is also a good view and we found it amazing to watch fly fishermen and how they didn't even move when a bear came near them. We only waited maybe 15 minutes for our turn because it was after Labor Day and there weren't many tourists at this time. The more tourists, the longer you're going to wait. Once on the platform, you are given an hour to view the bears. You can put your name on the list again and wait, if you have time. Here's the caveat. We JUST had enough time for one one-hour visit on the main platform before we had to be back on the plane, which was fine with us. But make sure you ask a lot of questions about timing and crowds and how much time you'll actually get at the main platform. Once you know what to expect, enjoy, because this was amazing.","September 22, 2019",Bucket list item: CHECK,26,Illinois,5
Brooks Falls,Make this trip - Make the effort! Well worth the journey and experience is once in a lifetime. Katmai Air and travel services - great group and very professional and communicative.

Brooks Falls,"The volunteer guides and NP staff are more than helpful. Please keep in mind that during busy periods, numbers are restricted on the platforms. Plan accordingly. We were lucky to have great weather and very few on the platforms after the daytrippers departed. A fantastic experience to be among the bears. Don't forget to do the heritage walk and the auditorium talks at night. There is so much to learn. And the bears speak for themselves. ","September 7, 2019",Awesome.,34,"Woongarrah, Australia",5

Brooks Falls,"You arrive by floatplane and are given a briefing as to how to react if you do come across a bear. One is encouraged to walk in a group of six people towards the boardwalk area which is a safe way for visitors to get close to the bears without compromising their safety. There are several viewing points along the boardwalk and from these viewing points one can take great photos of the bears safely. The rangers are knowledgeable, helpful and considerate.","August 12, 2019",A wonderful way to get up close to the bears safely,2,,5
Brooks Falls,"Our experience exceeded all our expectations! Bears, bears and more bears! Everywhere! A new walkway has been installed and from what I gather from visitors that have visited before...the new addition enhances the experience. The rangers have done a great job of protecting the bears from the foolishness of the visitors. They monitor the visitors and make sure that the proper distance is maintained and that the visitors don't disrupt the daily routine of the bears. My husband & I really appreciate the efforts of the park rangers to protect the bears. The rangers even closed the trail to allow a bear to take his/her nap on the trail! It was exciting to watch the bears feed on the salmon as the fish attempt to jump the falls. Along the trail to the falls, there were plenty of opportunities to view female bears with their cubs while they nursed, played and fished. We even saw cubs up in the trees. We found the juvenile bears inquisitive and somewhat mischievous.","August 11, 2019",Opportunity of a life time!,208,"West Linn, Oregon",5

Brooks Falls,"The sea plane ride and scenery is phenomenal. The bears are everywhere at Katmai and the falls are one of a kind. The rangers are the only negative. They pretend like they know what they are doing. The entry video is pointless, except the part of not running and don’t carry food. There were bears near our group on the trail and the rangers made zero noise and gripped their bear spray tightly. They act like they know how to speak to bears, but that’s obviously fake. The falls are a must see!","August 1, 2019","Amazing Bears, Fake Rangers",1,,5
Brooks Falls,Loved the hike to Brooks Falls. There are two viewing areas at the falls. One below the falls where one can get a great view of bears and wait until your turn to go to the viewing area at the falls. Can see the salmon jumping up the falls at the viewing area at the falls better than at the area below the falls. This was a great experience.,"July 29, 2019",Trip to Alaska,43,,5
Brooks Falls,"This is obviously the place to see brown bears in (unusual) high concentrations. There may have been 20+ at the falls and in the river when we visited early July. Also a mother with young cubs was seeking refuge from male bears near the lodge when we had dinner. It is all well organised, and despite the fact that you will have to share this with others it is worthwhile. ","July 28, 2019",Great place to visit.,63,"Schoten, Belgium",4

Brooks Falls,"We went in one of the high bear viewing seasons in July. The salmon were just packed in the river and jumping up the falls continually. Bears at the falls most of the time we were there and always visible from the lower river viewing decks, which was the best place to view Mamas and cubs. Rangers and volunteers were excellent at answering questions about the bears and salmon. At times there were ""bear jams"" where we weren't allowed to walk through the forest because the bears are not chased away from their natural habitat. The staff was great at keeping you safe. Buffet meals were delicious. Salmon a different way every night along with another type of meat. You can choose from a full dinner for $40 or mini for $20, which was soup, salad and dessert and quite filling as well. Free coffee and hot drinks all day if you are staying at the lodge. The restaurant staff was so friendly and helpful. Can not recommend this place highly enough. It is a bit pricey to go, but well worth it. If you want to stay in the lodge, you must apply by lottery about 18 months in advance so plan well!","July 24, 2019",Best place to view bears!,9,"Toronto, Canada",5
Brooks Falls,"We made a special trip to Katmai National Park from Anchorage to view the grizzly bears, and we were not disappointed. We looked at a couple of different private transportation services to get there, including Rust's and Katmailand. We ultimately settled on Katmailand, and we were not disappointed, even though the price was steep at $895 per person.Our trip started at a private hanger near the Anchorage airport, where we loaded into a nine passenger jet for the one hour and 15 minute flight to King Salmon. The flight left at around 7 AM, arriving in King Salmon at 8:15 AM. King Salmon is the main hub for getting to Brooks Camp, and it seemed like little float planes to and from Brooks Camp were constantly taking off and landing, whether with passengers, supplies, or both. Our flight on a 10 passenger float plane ultimately left at around 9:45 AM and landed at Brooks Camp on Naknek Lake at 10:05 AM. Immediately upon arrival we went to the visitor center for a briefing on bear safety. There was a 10 minute film, followed by a 10 minute life talk from the Ranger. After that, we were allowed to explore the entirety of Brooks Camp on our own.We immediately headed for Brooks Falls, knowing that that was the best place to view the grizzlies. We walked across the brand new bridge that was opened for the 2019 season, which was fantastic (no bear jams!). Several platforms off the bridge allowed you to stop and watch the grizzlies if there were any, and there definitely were each time we crossed it. The walk to Brooks Falls was ultimately around 20 minutes from the visitor center. The upper Falls viewing platform holds only 40 people at a time, and so they have a system for managing the tourists: When you arrive to the upper Falls location, you are given a buzzer similar to what you get at a restaurant by the host when you’re waiting for your table. You are than invited to go to the lower Falls platform viewing area to watch the grizzlies down stream while you wait for your buzzer to ring. Once your buzzer rings, you are permitted to go to the upper Falls for one hour.On the day we were there, the lower downstream area was actually better viewing for the bears then the upper Falls area. This was by far the highlight of our trip to Katmai, and probably even to Alaska overall.As part of our tour reservation through Katmailand, we were provided access to the buffet lunch at the dining lodge. I was not expecting much, but it actually was very good. There was a full salad bar, plus 4 or 5 hot dishes, including beef, chicken fried rice, sticky rice, and beef barley soup. There were also two desserts to choose from, chocolate brownies and pecan bars. There was plenty to eat for the vegan member in our group.Our flight was scheduled to leave at 4 PM, and we were told to check in back at the office near the visitor center and hour in advance. The fact that we had to check in a full hour early was a little disappointing, because once you come back down to the office and visitor center area from the Falls area, it is difficult to get back up to the Falls area for viewing, and so you are essentially ""stuck"" around the office area for the entire hour before your flight (although they do allow you to hang out on the new bridge, where we could still view some bears). Our flight eventually left around 3:50 PM, and we were headed back to King Salmon and then eventually to Anchorage.Viewing grizzlies at Brooks Falls is something everyone should do if you have the interest and ability! We went on July 12, and we probably saw 35 bears in total, with the maximum at any one time of around 10 or 11.","July 16, 2019",Amazing place to view grizzlies eating salmon,244,"Tampa, Florida",5
Brooks Falls,"If you are reading this you must be thinking about going to see the bears. We planned our trip 6 months ahead of time and of course the weather is a crapshoot. The salmon and bears are more dependable. Fortunately the weather for us was great and so were the bears. One thing we did not know about was the new pedestrian bridge across the river just out of Brooks Camp. Often the site of ""bear jams"" in the past the new bridge almost completely does away with them. I worked for the federal government over 40 years and the $6 million spent for this bridge is probably the best money the feds have spent in the past several decades. Because of the long daylight hours during the Alaska summer the bear platforms were open until 10:00PM in July when we were there. My advice is to spend the night if you can, so you can go to the platforms after the crowds leave and before they come the next morning. Starting 6 mos early I could not get a reservation to spend the night, so start real early for this. We flew Katmai Air from King Salmon after a 1 hr flight from Anchorage on a twin engine turbo PenAir. If you want to reproduce Mangelson's famous picture of a bear catching a fish in mid-air, good luck. I am suspicious of the authenticity of that shot. I did get a pano of 13 bears in the water at the falls and down stream.","July 15, 2019",Amazing experience of a lifetime,2,"Rockville, Maryland",5
Brooks Falls,"We flew in by floatplane from Kulik Lodge to Naknek Lake. After the short bear orientation video and ranger instructions, we headed straight to the viewing platform at the Falls. This way we beat the crowds and got to spend our first hour watching several bears fishing at the falls and watching the salmon jumping up to try to make it over the falls. Both bears and salmon were amazing to watch, and the falls and river are beautiful. Other parts of the day we spent at the Riffles platform below the falls where we watched multiple bears fishing, and on the platforms at the Lower River bridge where we saw several mother bears with cubs playing and fishing. After a buffet lunch at Brooks Lodge we returned to the Riffles platform which was extremely crowded by then, and we had to put our name on a list maintained by a patient and friendly park worker and wait for an hour to get back to the Falls platform for another turn. While waiting at the Riffles, we listened to a park ranger give lots of good information about the bears. Twice on the trail between Lower River and Riffles we encountered bears approaching and we had to calmly move off the trail into the high brush to let them pass (while our hearts were pounding). Moving or sleeping bears on the trails can cause delays because people are required to stay at least 50 yards away from the bears at all times so just be prepared to expect that.Infrastructure: Not far from the seaplane beach on Naknek Lake is the main lodge area where all the buildings are. From there you walk into a gated boardwalk above the area where the lake and Brooks River meet, and you are required to keep walking except for a few platform areas where you can stop and watch bears or look down in the lake at the swarms of salmon. At the end of that Lower River boardwalk you exit the gate and walk about a mile on an unprotected gravel trail, passing a pit toilet, to another gated boardwalk which leads to the Riffles and Falls platforms. Be alert to avoid bears on the trail between the gated boardwalks.Bear rules: Some people complain about having to wait for bears to move or other park rules, but we felt that the NPS is doing a great job keeping people from disturbing the bears in their habitat and keeping people safe, and if people will just follow the rules then we can all continue to have access to wild areas like this.","July 14, 2019",Bears and sockeye salmon aplenty!,37,"Hoover, Alabama",5
Brooks Falls,"This is obviously not an easy place to get to, and it is not cheap. So the few reviews talking about seeing no bears had me kind of freaked. And even then, is it really that big of a deal to see bears up close?I gotta tell you... this jaded family from NJ was blown away, including my 20 year old son who is not easily impressed. Every one of us gave this 5 stars. It is almost hard to describe, but you are within a few feet of bears without any safety net or fence whatsoever. And they are amazing. Eagles are soaring. Its just hard to explain. We did a ton of great excursions, and this was the most expensive. I never thought it would be the best... besting jet skies to glaciers and ATV tours to a glacier. But this was the tops. Our one regret came because it was early in our trip, and we did not buy swag. So buy yourself a t-shirt or something. So few people get here. And they don't sell Brooks Falls merch elsewhere. So just buy it, and be one of the few. And as far as lunch... it's fine. The staff is friendly, and the food is good enough- and we are kind of picky. Just keep expectations in check.The plane ride is magnificent, and there are several hiking trails if wildlife disappoints. So you are not going to be standing around.You are reading this, so you are probably asking yourself the same questions I did. So let me give you the answer: if its after July 1, go for it!! You won't miss the money.","July 13, 2019",I was dubious. I was wrong,55,"Mahwah, New Jersey",5
Brooks Falls,"Wow! We planned our entire Alaskan vacation in July to spend one day in Brooks falls. I was so afraid it would be disappointing.... boy was I wrong! Mama and two cubs on the beach as soon as the float plane landed! And it got better from there! Bears on the trails, bears in the marsh area, so many bears in the water! I lost count, but at one point we saw 22 BEARS AT THE SAME TIME! 22! My photos look like National Geographic. Bears catching salmon, eating salmon, a mama and three cubs fishing, huge bears!

Brooks Falls,"trip of a lifetime, great experience in July with the salmon running. Saw many bear behaviors. The falls itself gets crowded but is still worth the walk. Take water, we did not have a problem with bugs. Sometimes you get stopped with bear jams. The platforms gets busy, photographers can be annoying with their gigantic scopes, but the bears take the stage. There is always something to see and you can be there early in the morning before the crowds or after dinner when the day trippers leave.","July 6, 2019",awesome,386,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Brooks Falls,"An amazing opportunity to watch these huge creatures in the wild and see how they fish and interact with other bears. We spent so much time just watching the falls, fish jumping, bears ambling into view, birds, more bears coming by, often walking right under our feet as they arrived or left the raised platform. I was concerned that we might be there too early (June 19), but the salmon had just begun running and the bears were beginning to get active. ","July 5, 2019",So close to bears,8,"Ashland, Oregon",5
Brooks Falls,"I visited for a day trip at the end of June so the salmon should have been running but they were not - that's wildlife viewing for you. Hence few bears. I thought the journey by light aircraft and seaplane was fun although the seaplane was so dirty it must have been carrying about 50lb extra weight. The interior was truly disgusting. That said the pilot who had been flying since 1974 was clearly adept; I didn't feel any of the take-offs or landings. The plane had probably been flying as long as he had and had never been cleaned; there was a notice saying don't touch the windows but you really wouldn't want to! The funniest thing was the woman who wanted to sit up front in the right hand seat on the return journey. By the time the short flight was over she was absolutely hysterical; she said all the red lights and warnings were going off all the time and she thought we were going to crash! I think the pilot was probably ex military and clearly knew what he was doing.At Brooks Falls we had to listen to yet another bear safety talk and then left to make our way to the falls area. The walk is long and there is little to see in the way of wildlife on the way. I can imagine that when the salmon are running the bears would be there in profusion but sadly I saw only a couple and they were unable to find any salmon.Lunch was pretty grim with a tasteless shepherds pie and either very sad looking veg or salad. The girl taking the lunch money was so thick I was having to make each word a sentence until another staff member came over and took control. The guides were, as elsewhere, not good; most had only been there 5 minutes and knew little ouside of their learnt spiel.Birds and other wildlife were in short supply as the area is so vast they all remained in the quieter areas; something I found was generally true wherever I went.The cabins which were available for overnight accommodation looked very basic and tiny; at over $600 if you wanted one to yourself it must be the most expensive campsite anywhere.","July 3, 2019",Salmon not running so little to see,10,,3

A once in a lifetime experience and well worth the effort to get there and the cost. Even the float plane is an experience. Close up experience with a couple of bears on the track added to the excitement. We did a day trip from Anchorage and was fortunate the day was clear and weather fine. Nice lunch provided and everyone in our group agreed this was the highlight of our 5 week trip in Alaska and Canada.

Brooks Falls,"Tuesday, 24 July 2018, booked through Katmailand. This trip included transportation by 4 different flights, 2 by turboprop, and 2 by floatplane. As a pilot, I can vouch for the safety and efficiency of all the flights. The first thing after landing at Brooks Lake (the floatplane base for Brooks Falls) you will receive a bear safety briefing. Pay attention, you will have a personal experience with a brown bear before your day ends. The visitor center is located about 2 miles by road from the floatplane base, requiring bus transport, and ½ mile walk over a trail and bridge, often interrupted by bear jams. The visitor center is a compact collection of necessary cabins and mess hall designed to accommodate day and overnight visitors. Most buildings are scarred by the clawing of bears. NPS personnel and Katmailand employees are everywhere. One of the more interesting positions is bear technician (a.k.a. bear harasser). These intrepid souls are the negotiators/arbitrators between bear and human contact. Both species must obey their guidance at all times. The meal provided by our package and the kitchen staff was served buffet style, precisely at noon, and was delicious. Plenty of choices, always fresh coffee, and a warm inviting fire in the adjoining lodge room. Your experience at Brooks is left to your imagination after your briefing. You can walk anywhere, sit by the campfire, or go fishing if you choose. We were a party of 4, and one of our members became ill (bad cold) and was left by the campfire. The other 3 explored and made our way to Brooks Falls for those famous pictures (a back-track walk of almost 1.5 miles). Only 4 bears here, no leaping salmon, but still a great experience. We then walked back to the floatplane base to await our plane ride home. The day we were there most bear activity encounters were at the visitor center, and along trails roads. Bears, especially sows and cubs were in constant presence amongst the visitor center complex. Many bears were along the roads and trails. The only place skimpy on bears was the falls. No one I spoke with could adequately explain the distribution of bears at any location, (there were plenty of salmon in the river) and a lot of human activity at the visitor center, but loads of bears at the visitor center, somewhat contrary to intuition. I recite the following experience to highlight the spontaneous atmosphere at Brooks. While waiting for our ride back to civilization, my wife and I settled in at the floatplane base, (nothing more than a covered picnic table, food locker, and wide gravel area to the edge of Brooks Lake. A compact area. Taking a que from a floatplane pilot passing time between flights, I settled in along the lake’s edge to soak up some rays of sunlight, and soon began to doze about 10 feet away from the likewise sleeping pilot. Surprised and unexpectedly, I was awakened by the jumping pilot, kicking rocks and yelling at the top of his lungs in some ancient human tongue. Momentarily, my blurry eyes caught the vision of two yearling brown bears 10 feet away. I quickly tried to recall from my safety briefing and any mention whatsoever of bears ability to swim, what to do if chased into water, etc.…nothing came to mind, but the bears were by that time retreating backwards at the sight of the crazed Neanderthal pilot. That was my personal bear experience at Brooks, and it occurred at the place you will receive your bear safety briefing. And yes, I asked my wife what the hell she was doing as these bears approached me at the lakes edge, and she gave the standard Brooks answer to everything “I was taking pictures of the bears”. If you are planning this trip one, two, or three years in advance as I did, rest assured you will be happy with your choice and will have experiences that warrant the stiff price of this experience. Book in the prime months (June-July) and be assured you’ll see plenty of bears, and more importantly, have a personal bear experience.","August 13, 2018",YOU WILL HAVE A BEAR ENCOUNTER,21,florida,5
Brooks Falls,"Seeing the Bears was just simply amazing. The viewing platform is great and we spent a good hour and a half observing the bears. We had to wait two hours when we arrived to cross the bridge, though, as there were bears within 50 yard which then went to sleep. I totally appreciate the need to keep safe and was happy to wait (in retrospect, after having a good observation time with them!) but this waiting time made no sense, when, on the way back we were approached by a bear and there were no rangers allocated to monitor those areas. Seems a little strange to me. Thankfully, a guide with another group took charge of the situation and managed the bear's behaviour and ours.","August 12, 2018",A definite if you want to see bears,4,,4
Brooks Falls,"This was our 56th National Park and one of the best to which we have been.  There are no roads in or out of the Park, so most visitors get there by bush plane to King Salmon and then a float plane to one of the lakes by the Park; Anchorage and Homer flying services also offer trips directly to the area. We were fortunate to take a flight offered by Trail Ridge Air directly there on our last day in Alaska. There are camping facilities and a great lodge within the Park; both sell out very far in advance; however, most visitors are day only visitors. There are a number of activities to do in this National Park, but most people come for the bears at Brooks Falls. This is the area where the brown bears congregate to feed on the salmon which are going upstream to spawn. A viewing platform close to the ranger station and lodge exists to watch bears feed in the Naknek Lake area. There are two other viewing platforms to see the falls—one further down stream which has some great views but serves as a waiting area for the final trek to the falls viewing platform; this is approached by a boardwalk and is very controlled during high periods of visitation; your time there will probably be limited in high season which is July.  When you arrive, you have to go to “bear school” where you learn how to deal with bears that you may encounter on your trek to the viewing platforms. Rangers give about a 15-minute presentation often at both areas of access to the falls—Brooks Lake or Naknek Lake. Regardless of which lake on which you land, after “bear school”, you must walk a little over a mile to the falls and bear viewing platforms. The NPS Visitors Center is near Naknek Lake and requires a further walk if you have landed at Brooks Lake. There is also an excursion to the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes in the Park of which we did not take advantage. This National Park is worth all the time and money it takes to get there.","August 11, 2018","Bears, Bears, Bears",176,Illinois,5

Brooks Falls,"After seeing all the nature shows on the falls, decided to make the trip. Flew a turboprop on Pitt Air from Anchorage to King Salmon, then a float plane (Katmai Air) to Brooks Lake. It’s 18 minute flight over in a 6 passenger or 10 passenger float plane; this is fascinating for those who like to fly, but a little scary for those who don’t. Upon landing, you MUST go through the Bear brief at the visitor center (you will NOT be allowed out of the area w/o this briefing), then you dump ALL food/gum at a food locker, then you can attempt the 1.3 mile walk to Brooks Falls. There are several park rangers observing the area for bears, and stopping visitors in controlled areas when the bears roam too close. There are two observation areas at Brooks Falls; the lower one has adequate room for people to watch from, and great views... but the upper one BY the falls, only has room for 40 people. Rangers control access w/ waiting lists; it may be an hour for people to get access... it’s worth it. You’ll see bears roaming BELOW you, in front of you, and fishing in the falls. If you have any interest in bears, and can afford this trip - do it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","August 5, 2018","It’s a “Bear” to get there, but boy is it worth it!",100,"Bonn, Germany",5
Brooks Falls,"I had the privilege of spending time watching the bears at Brooks Falls. It was amazing. The best viewing is at the upper falls where you can see bears grabbing salmon out of the water. Some fish below the falls, some above where you can see salmon leap straight into the mouths of the bears. I was lucky to go on a day when there were not so many people so was able to spend most of my day at the upper platform. I saw a mother with four cubs and many many bears.From there you can also watch the salmon leap up the falls. This is also fascinating and you end up willing them to make it as so many try and fall back into the river below.There are also bald eagles in the vicinity and I saw one dive down and grab a salmon before flying off with it. I think this day will be my highlight day of my four weeks in Alaska.","August 3, 2018",One of the best bear viewing places in the world,164,"Scotland, United Kingdom",5

Brooks Falls,"We took a day trip from Anchorage with KatmaiLand. The trip went as planned. We arrived at Katmai, had a delicious lunch and then headed out to see the bears at the Upper Falls.Wait time was around 90min. But the viewing was very well planned by rangers, allowing 40 people at a time for one hour. Kids did get a bit restless. But was a treat to watch so many bears and the salmon jumping over the falls. Felt the bear activity grew as the afternoon progressed. We got to spend 6 Hrs+ in Katmai.Would recommend taking Dramamine for the float plane ride.","August 2, 2018",Highlight of Alaska Trip,4,,5
Brooks Falls,"Make sure to either arrive early or to at least go and give your name to the ranger as soon as you can to ensure you get a go at the upper platforms. Not that you don't get to see the bears feeding from the lower platform but it's just closer. There are so many bears here at Katmai that we saw our first one on the beach where the planes disembark so truly pay attention to the rangers' indications and orientations. We were told to expect delays at the bridge because it was often closed due to bear activity nearby, believe that as well (we had to stop and wait 20 minutes the first crossing and narrowly missed having to wait 20 more in the return). Overall seeing the bears feed at the falls so close to you is really amazing. After a while you can really tell apart their different styles of fishing and you can even see some of them cooperating. Also there are a lot of moms with cubs around as well so it's a whole experience definitely worth your time and money. ","August 2, 2018",Unforgettable ,88,"Lisbon, Portugal",5
Brooks Falls,"Wonderful experience. Highly recommended. The bears are wild and you need to be vigilant and respectful. Visitors need to be quiet when at the falls - dont get so excited that you cheer the bears when they catch a fish! Also be aware of your surroundings and shut gates properly. It was expensive to get there, but worth it. Recommend you stay all day - it was always changing","August 1, 2018",AMAZING/ Highlight of our holiday,2,"Sydney, Australia",5
Brooks Falls,"This place is of course amazing but it is a 3 due to the risk. They say no one has been hurt. But the bears are there and you can be right next to them before you see them. And they might touch and sniff you as happened recently. As the place gets more crowded, the chances of a bad incident increase—they have to. You also are trusting strangers not to do dumb things like fail to close the lock on the campground gate or not to yell at a bear. And you do wonder if you ought to just leave this place for the bears and watch them on the live video feed. So go at your own risk and don’t let your children get more than 6 inches away.

Brooks Falls,"What a place to close observe bears and bear behavior. We saw 23 at one time from the falls platform. A level trail of about a mile takes you from Brooks Lodge to the falls viewing platform.

Brooks Falls,"It’s impossible to put this gem, this miraculous world into words. The falls with hundreds salmon jumping and scores of bears hunting, playing, and relaxing in the waters is breathtaking. But even the lower viewing platform where we had a 100 minute “delay” - a bridge closing due to over 10 bears including a family of 3 playing, eating, relaxing and even “making friends” was a spectacular slice of our world. The rangers were outstanding educators and stewards. They were co-stars and clearly love the bears and the ecosystem they use to teach us without disturbing it. The food exceeded our expectations. The Katmai Air staff are nice though a little gruff as were the float plane pilots. The talk by the native Alaskan (while we waited for the float plane) was excellent. Tips: 1. Get to the upper platform as early as you can since you only get an hour and you will want to come back, 2. Bring a head net and bug spray, 3. Bring water if going through King Salmon on Pen Air (they have no water fountain and the water is not potable). Remember: it’s the bear’s world. Respect them and listen to the rangers. Leave ample time to get back in case the bridge is closed. ","July 22, 2018",Speechless,71,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Brooks Falls,"Just an amazing place.The Katmai National Park is a real treasure. There are no roads to it or boat access, so the only way there is on a float plane. The trails, woods, and river are all beautiful. There were at least 20 bears in the river at all times and it was mesmerizing. The salmon were running well, and the whole experience was lovely.Be prepared for a wait to get onto the viewing platform. There is still much to do and see while you wait. I prefer to wait rather than get crushed by dozens of tourists. The park rangers handle the process well and efficiently.This park is a must do.

Brooks Falls,"This has got to be the most awesome wildlife viewing I had ever joined! I saw 15 bears at the Falls and at least 9 more in the vicinity of Brooks Lodge.The bears at the Falls are fishing for salmon and the two elevated viewing platforms allowed us to see them up close! It's a good thing that NPS rangers control the number of people at the Falls platform (40 for now) and the time they can spend there (1 hour). This gives all visitors a chance to enjoy the best viewing. When the Falls platform is full, you'll need to register with a ranger. After registration, you can proceed to the second platform (slightly downstream from the falls) to see the bears while waiting. Fret not as some bears come up close too! A mother brought her 3 cubs while I was there! The rangers will call out your names at this second platform when your turn comes.For photographers, bring a monopod for your big lenses, as tripods are banned at the Falls platform for now. A 400+mm lense would allow you to isolate a nearby bear standing on top of the Brook Falls while you are at the Falls platform.","July 22, 2018",Out of the world experience!

Brooks Falls,"As good as the hype you’ve heard - but try to stay in the park to maximize your experience. The people who fly in and out on a day trip take a risk. Sometimes the bears are there all day, sometimes mostly in the morning, sometimes mostly in the afternoon. If you’re on an afternoon trip and it’s a slow afternoon, you might not see much. Or you could get caught in a “bear jam” (bears on the path or near the small bridge that you use to cross the river, that lead the rangers to halt all traffic until the bears move on) that cuts down on your time. Not everyone can stay in the park, but if there’s any way you can swing it, I would highly recommend it.","July 21, 2018",Incredible during the salmon run,94,Florida,5
Brooks Falls,"Wow wow and WOW! My partner and I did the day trip to Brooks Falls with Rusts Flying Service - it's not cheap but if you can manage it I can't recommend it highly enough! It cost us $1,200pp by the time we lost 30 cents in the dollar, but it was AMAZING. Would LOVE to stay at the lodge a few nights but that's another $800 per night so we just couldn't. We booked about 6 months in advance (it books out EARLY!) so crossed our fingers it wouldn't be cancelled due to weather, but we got a sunny day (one of our few so far on this trip). My favourite part was seeing a mama with her 2 cubs, the cubs were playing right below the deck I was on, then she took them up to the falls to take them fishing, so when we went back to the falls we were able to watch them again. You do a 20 minute bear school on arrival so you know what to do and there are rangers everywhere. After bear school I recommend you head straight to the Upper Falls to put your name on the waiting list as it can be a 2 hour wait or more - then you just go to the lower viewing platform or do what we did and head back to have our lunch as you cannot take ANY food on the trail. You eat it back at the picnic spot with the electric fence around it. They have a little room for all food stuffs and another for all other stuff...you only take a backpack that you can carry. When we were walking back to the place for lunch, that's when we encountered the cubs playfighting near the bridge! Do NOT worry if you do not end up getting onto the platform for the Upper Falls, you see so much action on the lower platform anyway (and can even zoom up to the main falls with your camera or binoculars) - and on the platform near the bridge! For children you must hold their hand, and for really little ones you must either carry them in your arms or on yourself in something. Not that you would have taken a pram on the plane anyway! But in this place, it's all about the bears (but safety of both the bears and the humans). As we were leaving, a bear started walking up the beach so we had to quickly board our floatplane - not for our safety but the beach is the bears' highway and they want the bears to feel happy to keep using it. So if you are coming to Alaska - this is the thing I would recommend the most BY FAR! Oh I am still on a high from it! Watching the cubs - the mama showing them, the dark cub finding a fish but growling at the light cub who wanted to share it - but then when the white cub caught one it shared it! You are SO close to the bears, it's fantastic! The flight both ways was also incredibly scenic. An amazing day. It's worth splashing out on if you can manage it. Oh and wear bug spray too. And we saw a guy there in a wheelchair too so that's also do-able.","July 16, 2018","AMAZING, FANTASTIC, THE BEST THING I'VE EVER DONE!",96,"Melbourne, Australia",5

Brooks Falls,"Viewing the Brown Bears at Brooks Falls was the highlight of our vacation. We even planned our vacation around the Salmon run for optimal viewing opportunities. This was such an amazing experience that we will never forget. We arrived by float plane from king Salmon. On our fist day we had to stay on the plane for several minutes because there were several bears on the beach and in the water by the planes. The first thing that everybody does is go to bear school. There is a food cache for storing any food that you brought with you. No one is allowed to have any food or gum outside of the cache unless you are in the lodge or fenced in picnic area. Bears are everywhere! They come into the camp area and are on all of the paths. There is a gravel path all the way to the falls. You will see bear trails every few feet on both sides of this path. It really gets the adrenaline pumping when they walk out of these paths right onto the trail in front of you. Bears always have the right away! We were forced to back up several times when bears were walking toward us on the path. the main thing is to make noise so the bears know you are there and you don't round a bend and surprise them. We kept a constant conversation going and scuffed our boots against the gravel as we walked. The bears fishing at the falls are an amazing sight to see. The dominant bears secure the spots under the falls where the Salmon pile up before they jump. The adolescent bears are on top of the falls where it takes a little more skill and effort to catch a jumping Salmon. It was so much fun to watch their behavior. one bear down stream was just having fun diving into the deep water over and over again. We saw two moms with yearling cubs downstream in the still water. one had two cubs and the other had three. The day before we arrived, a mom with two spring cubs tried to go to the falls. Unfortunately, one of the dominate bears killed one of her cubs. It was still in the grass by the falls. Definitely a once in a life time adventure!","July 13, 2018",Once in a life time experience,20,Arkansas,5

Had a 2 hour delay due to weather which cannot be helped and did not effect our day, just proved to us they were a safe company. we were not happy to go unless they were! Our pilot Justin was fantastic, very experienced and friendly. we had a rainy cold day at brooks falls but saw plenty of bear activity regardless. You put your name on a list for the upper falls platform, while waiting to be called you can view bears from the lower platform which was just as good! saw plenty of action there. had about 3 hours watching the bears which was plenty. then a 2 hr scenic flight back. Even with a 2 hour delay we felt we had enough time to see everything. being from Australia we thought the bears were fantastic, highly reccommend this company!","July 10, 2018",Rusts bear viewing brooks falls,4,"Perth, Australia",5
Brooks Falls,"I cannot believe that anyone would go to the effort of travelling to Brooks Falls to see grizzlies and not have done extensive research beforehand on the best time to go, what you need to take with you and find out as much as you can. Yes, watching the grizzlies catch and eat salmon and seeing the bear hierarchy in action is amazing. But the other two platforms sometimes offer just as much activity and certainly other behaviors that you just won't see at the falls. We were there for three days so we can attest to that. We were on a group wildlife tour and flew over daily in floatplanes. As soon as you come off the plane and up to the building, you must attend bear school. It is a relatively short video presentation along with a ranger talk. Upon completion, you are given a bear pin. You must wear it at all times and if a ranger sees you without it, they can request you to go back and attend school again. Safety is priority for both you and the bear's sake. We not only saw a grizzly saunter past as we were slowly coming out of a porta john along the trail; there was a large bear just about 10 feet below our viewing platform as well as others walking by on the other end (below) of the platform, go into the woods. We saw courtship behavior, dancing behavior with a flower, moms with cubs, and even, on our last day as my half of the group was boarding a float plane, a bear was walking down the beach toward us. Initially, I was apprehensive, but the bears are habituated to people acting a certain way (thus the movie and ranger talk at bear school) and mostly just walk the other way to avoid you. There has never been a negative encounter in 20 years. That being said, we did see someone letting their small child run in front of them on the path. STUPID! Some people just don't think and those are the ones who could ruin it for all. All of the rangers but one were extremely pleasant, full of information and very helpful. There were occasions when bears were sighted and people kept on walking. The rangers are stationed at either ends of bridges and on platforms and are in constant communication with each other so they know what the bears are doing and where they are. I heard a ranger yell out a few times for someone to get off the trail but they just kept walking. STUPID! Bears always have the right of way. Bear school 101. And if you drop something off the side of the rail, it's gone. Nobody is going to go after it for you. One person lost a pair of prescription glasses. The ranger tried several times to reach it with a very long pole and net, without success. Don't put anything down on the rail. Not only will it be gone forever but a bear or bird could ingest it. Be responsible.There are cabins for people who wish to stay at the falls but they are very small. We did not go inside. They do not have a bathroom so you need to go to the public bathroom. The flush toilets have one small stall shower that you pay for with tokens. We met someone on the trail who was tent camping and he told us the tokens were $7 each and they were a thin plastic that can break. I am very glad we chose not to stay there. There are other restrooms but they are not flush toilets. We were only there for lunch and they had a long salad bar and other main lunch items. They have a small gift shop and a Visitor's Center. They have kayaking which we did not do and there were several fisherman in the water. They were not next to the bears on purpose but there were times when bears would be quite close to them, sometimes without their knowledge. Again - bear school. I said you could go on a rainy day. The bears are out regardless and you might see things you wouldn't otherwise see. However, keep in mind that it could get cold, more bugs and less visibility depending on the amount and duration of the rain. And humidity afterwards. Things change on a dime in Alaska. Be prepared. Again, because my photos don't do it justice and almost everything was a video anyway and there are beautiful photos on here already, I didn't supply any.","July 9, 2018",Absolutely incredible.,20,"Toledo, Ohio",5
Brooks Falls,We enjoyed two weeks in Alaska on a northbound cruise and then Denali. We extended in Anchorage specifically to visit Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park. We flew on a float plane using Rust's Flying Service out of Anchorage. The flight is long but enjoyable and we ended up having 4-5 hours in Katmai. Brooks Falls was a tremendous experience. The brown bears were actively feeding on salmon in the Falls and we could observe from a nearby platform. The park rangers were very helpful and informative.

Brooks Falls,"What a fabulous adventure our trip to Brooks Lodge and Brooks Falls was. We flew in by float plane for a day trip. Before you can go anywhere, you have to attend a briefing conducted by park rangers on the park layout and bear safety. There are two viewing platforms including the most famous, right at Brooks Falls. It is a bit of a hike to the Falls viewing platform and you do have to go on heavily wooded trails to get there. It is a bit gut wrenching because you know the bears are there - just make a LOT of noise. Once you get to the platform the amazing treat of seeing bears up close and personal begins. We were there on a day that was not too crowded so we were not time limited on the platform. It was amazing. The bears are literally right under the platform, in the water, climbing the falls, catching salmon....fantastic views. You really get a feel for ""bear dynamics"" and we were lucky to see a mom and two cubs fishing and eating. We decided to go back to the lodge to grab lunch (which was pretty good) and had every intention of going back to the falls however we learned about ""bear jams"" at the bridge crossing the river to get to the viewing platforms. So the good news was that we saw several bears right at the lodge - going by the windows while we ate, on the beach, in the lake, etc. - and the bad news was there were several bear jams which meant we couldn't cross over the river to get back to the platform. Normally this would have been very disappointing but there were so many bears everywhere, you didn't feel like you were missing anything. Rangers were ever present and made sure everyone followed the rules and stayed safe. This is important because you quickly realize how fast the bears move and how you have to constantly be on your toes.What an amazing experience - highly recommend Katmai as a day trip or overnight if you are lucky enough to get accommodations.","October 14, 2017",Fabulous Bear Adventure,184,"Lake Jackson, Texas",5

Brooks Falls,"We made it to Brooks Falls on a Saturday afternoon in September...two days before the lodge was closing. Getting to the falls was harder than we imagined - we didn't know that the bridge would close so often and for such lengths of time. In September, there are many bears downstream - and the bridge closings are often and timely. Twice, we had bears falls asleep right under the platform! We did eventually make it to the falls - and just enjoyed being there. There was no wait line- and at one point, there were five bears right at the falls (and maybe 4 more in the area).The salmon are not jumping the falls in September, but if you still want to see the bears...we found it a good time to go. No waits, lots of bears, and No Mosquitoes!Just be mindful of the bear jams if you do a daytrip . We did a one-night stay. After watching about eight people almost miss their flight the day before we left, we opted not to cross the river the day we were leaving...too risky. There were seven others on our 4 pm flight that made the same decision. The bridge didn't open until about noon - the people were told that if they had the 4:00 flight, based upon the high bear activity, they should not cross the river and expect to make the flight. They were right, we left without two people. Luckily, there were two people from the 5 pm flight that took their spot leaving two spots open on the later flight. Just be mindful if you are making a day trip - it might not always work out for the best.There are pit toilets on the brooks falls side of the river...use them when you can - you just never know how long you might be stuck somewhere!Other hikes in the area that we thought were good - Dumpling Mountain - we went to the overlook - gorgeous!Brooks Lake - like a sheet of glass - a lot of anglersCultural Site - we did the ranger talk, very good and interesting...more on the history of why the park is a national park.","September 25, 2017",A Wonderful Day in September,249,"Warrenville, IL",5

It is a lot of money but I decided to do it anyway because I thought that I will regret it afterwards if I didn't try. I don't know if I will ever travel to Alaska again, so I am very happy I did as much as I could while there. This place is a unique spot to watch the bears because they have so much salmon to eat that they are less territorial with other bears and with humans. No need to fight for food and territory if you have plenty. We saw mothers with their cubs, we saw young teenage bears and of course we saw adults. As they say: it is Bear Paradise.

Brooks Falls,"We booked our stay at Brooks Lodge inside Katmai National Park for 3 days the first of August 2017 we booked 10 months in advance and could not book anytime during the month of July it was full. July is suppose to be the best time of year during the Salmon run to view the Grizzly Bears at Brooks Falls we booked the August 1st dates hoping the Bears were still going to be at the falls. WHAT A TRIP!!!. THEY WERE STILL THERE IN FORCE. We flew from Anchorage to King Salmon via Pen Air then boarded a float plane Katmai Air for the short flight to Katmai National Park. Flights to and from Anchorage and Lodging were included in the Brooks Lodge package food is and extra charge based on what meals you eat each day all meals are served Buffet style at preset hours. The Lodging was a small individual cabin with 4 bunk beads, bathroom, heater, and shower which are sufficient for a comfortable stay. We arrived and after a required Ranger Bear orientation film and checking into the lodge we immediately took off to Brooks Falls to get our first siting of the Bears. I must repeat it was amazing you are literally walking in Grizzly territory learning how to make noise as you walk and getting very good at saying HEY BEAR when you spot or hear a Grizzly on a path to the falls, on the beach or in camp around the cabins which happens frequently. On one of our many visits to the Falls I counted 17 bears all doing their thing trying to catch the elusive Salmon with out seeing any fights between the bears including Moms with Cubs, Females, and Males. It seems dangerous to be walking around an area where Grizzlies are actively roaming free and it could be if your not always aware and a GREAT FANTASTIC GROUP of RANGERS were not on site constantly monitoring bear movement. Cannot say enough about the quality of the Rangers, they continually watch, report, block paths, close walking paths, keep bears moving, and keep visitors aware of any bear movement and their location, many times the walking bridge from the Lodge to the upper and lower viewing platforms was closed due to bear activity in the area we actually had to wait on the platform side of the bridge for 2 hours waiting for a mom sand her cubs to leave the area, bears were not chased or made to move the Rangers realize this is the Bears home so people wait bears do not. We stayed the three days and had the time of our life you can figure roughly $1000.00 per night per couple Air Fare, Cabin, Food, & Gratuity for a similar length stay . HIGHLY RECOMMEND this trip. We also saw many fishermen making the trip to Katmai as we understand its a great fishing destination we did not fish, we did see fishermen having to leave the water when a bear approached Another possibility for packers and campers is to get a flight to the Park out of King Salmon and stay in the tent area campground right down the path from the Lodge. The campground is surrounded by an electric fence to hopefully prevent Bears from entering and it seems to work based on our conversations with the campers, many were families with small children. The camping area has special places to eat inside another electric fenced area or the campers can purchase meals at the lodge. To get a good look at the falls Salmon and bear activity try visiting Explore.org and find the LIVECAM Brooks Falls you can actually snap pictures while on this LIVECAM. The bear activity is solely based on the Salmon activity at the falls and lower river, the lodge is normally open first part of June through mid September. Its to bad that it's not more economical to get to Katmai National Park it would be great if more families could visit the park its such a fantastic place. If your thinking of visiting the WONDERFUL destination be sure to begin your planning 12 months in advance.","August 9, 2017",Best Bear Viewing EVER,38,"Palm Desert, California",5

So, we backed up slowly about a quarter of a mile until we reached the restroom and watched the bears take another route. We then resumed our walk until we were at the Falls. Only forty people can be on the top platform at a time so we waited about an hour at the ripple platform where we saw multiple bears. Getting to the top platform was great, we saw many bears eating salmon. The smell of dead fish was very pungent but the challenge of taking a perfect picture took our mind off that bad smell. We went back again the next day and took numerous pictures. This adventure was surely the highlight of our trip to Alaska.","August 2, 2017",Highlight of Alaska,13,"Ottawa, Canada",5
Brooks Falls,"I went solo camping in Katmai for a week. It was amazing. I went the first week of July. The salmon were running. Here are some tips:1. Book a few days if you can. The weather can be rainy, overcast, etc. For Photography, you really want a few days (I felt like 7 was perfect since 4 days were rainy). I saw day trippers get minimal time in overcast weather to see a bear. It is though.2. Budget in the hike to 10,000 smokes. It is neat. I would not do the ranger lead walk and do it yourself if you are able bodied. Why? Because then you can see the waterfall and the fork where the rivers meet as opposed to just the one place. If you have seen waterfalls before, the union of the rivers (confluence) is a better hike. Though the waterfall hike let you get real close to the volcanic ash. Both are great, do both on your own since you can move faster (unless you are elderly, then please go with the ranger since it can be tough coming back up).3. The rangers here are AMAZING. Chat with one of them if you are a naturalist. 4. You will encounter bears. I didn't take bear spray. Just don't be stupid and respect distances to the bears.5. If camping, bring an inflatable mattress. I didn't and didn't sleep well. Ended up making a nest with my clothing.6. Take a good sleeping bag that can keep you warm. Night time temps can suddenly drop.7. Rain gear is a must. So is wearing layers in July. 8. I over packed food and gear. Do you really need 3 flash lights?9. There is a lodge where you can get beer and charge your camera gear. I took batteries for a week's worth. It did limit my down time charging and maximized my field time. To each their own.10. The bridge to cross the river will get closed and you may have to wait hours. Best bear viewing is after 9pm, in my opinion. The beach is filled with bears, day travelers are gone or sleeping. 11. Some of the day trippers can be real jerks. Mostly cruise people flying for the day or really anti nature folks just there to fish. Who goes to a place famous for bears and says ""To bad you can't shoot these guys. I shot one last year smaller then that one."" Go off the beaten path to avoid these people.12. If you are brave, bring waders and walk the river. Just respect the bears and be alert. :)I plan on coming back. I loved this place.","July 30, 2017",Camping in Brooks fall,27,"Miami, Florida",5
Brooks Falls,"It's about a 1 mile hike to the falls. You'll see lots of bears before you get to the falls. There may be ""bear jams"" on the trail. Viewing platform offers excellent views of the feeding frenzy.","July 28, 2017",Hard to imagine the number of bears.,13,"Dayton, Ohio",5
Brooks Falls,"Day trippers here - cliff note version: Saw nine bears just getting from the plane to the beach. There were extensive bear jams at the bridge crossing. Due to low water levels the bears were having an easier time catching salmon in the lower river. Thus, more bears in the area and more bear jams. For my wife and I, one day was plenty. With great weather, plenty of bears catching salmon, and seeing bears from all three platforms, you have bears in continual view. So, if you catch a good day, you may feel one day is more than plenty. For 2017, I understand bear jams were extensive - frequent and long in duration (ie: couldn't cross the bridge because bears were within 50 yards of the bridge). In some cases bears were sleeping right next to the entrance gate to the bridge. This really limits the ability to walk around. Other mammalian species we came across - that would be none. Other birds - eagle, gulls, and a couple other types. Fish - salmon. That is about it.So, it is bears bears and bears and salmon. Glad we did it and one day was plenty for us (and I was a zoo volunteer for over 10 years). How the day went:1. Left on floatplane from King Salmon at 9:30 am even though we weren't scheduled to leave until 10:30am. One hour early...sometimes it happens.2. Arrived about 10:00am and got into the bear safety talk about 10:20. By 10:45 we were on our way to the bridge crossing.3. Got to the bridge crossing just as the ranger said it was now OK to walk across. So, any earlier and we would have been standing around anyway.4. After watching bears at lower river we began the walk to the falls and arrived about 11:30. Got on the list to go to the upper platform.5. Within 25 minutes we were called to go on the upper platform. The short wait was OK because the bears at the riffles platform were very entertaining.6. Stayed at the upper platform for over 1.5 hours, maybe almost two. How did we pull it off? Bear jams. They stopped folks from getting to the platform. Once the bear jams cleared though, the upper platform started filling up again and we never got back onto it. We could have if we waited over an hour but why do that when there was so much activity at the lower platform.7. We wanted to get lunch but the bear jam at the lower platform went on for like two hours. So, we miss lunch. Meanwhile, we were more than entertained by a variety of bears at the lower falls. 8. Eventually we are told by Katmai Air to not cross the bridge cause the planes will take off from the trail side of the bridge. And we left at 7pm for King Salmon. We tried to get on an earlier flight but couldn't.","July 27, 2017","Bears, Bears and Bears",25,"South Riding, Virginia",5
Brooks Falls,"We were at Brooks Camp, in KNP&P, on a very wet day and on a same-day roundtrip from Anchorage. Except for the weather, we had it all!It was late in July and the salmon run was at its peak.We saw brown bears in Brooks Lake, on the lake’s shore, in the woods and around camp; we saw bear sows with this year's cubs, sows with previous years’ cubs, young males, large males, XL males; we saw brown bears catching salmon at the base of the waterfalls, on top of the waterfalls and out of the stream. Had we had enough time, we would most likely have been able to shoot the iconic picture of a salmon jumping straight into the bear's jaws...A very recommendable experience for all who travel Alaska in search of wilderness and wildlife in action, in a rather pristine environment, despite the heavy tourist traffic. You really feel out there with the bears most of the time!The whole program was well organized and executed by the staff and the camp' rangers. Even the buffet lunch available at the camp, next to a big fireplace, was enjoyable. A high point if our Alaska trip. Equally enjoyable by families and seniors.Negative highlight for the nightmarish queues at King Salmon' airport, on the way back.","July 27, 2017",Bears!,38,"Sao Paulo, SP",5
Brooks Falls,"It's a bucket list event. From the moment you step on to the small float plane, to the first encounter with a bear. The flight over with Katmai air was great friendly professional pilots. As we landed two brown bears were fighting on the beach. We were given a brief lecture on what to do when you encounter a bear then set free to roam the area unchaperoned. They have rangers patrolling the area. We saw at least 20 bears, most at close range. We encountered plenty of bears. It was definitely a top 3 for me. ","July 23, 2017",Wow,9,"Gold Coast, Australia",5
Brooks Falls,"Loved Brooks the first time and loved it again now. We camped behind a secure electric fence and stored food and gear in separate walk-in lockers. Campsite was spotless and vault toilets were cleaned and restocked regularly. But crossing the floating bridge to get to bear viewing platforms was impossible! Really! Rangers crowded us in places where many couldn't even see bears for up to 7 hours. Then a hundred people were rushed across at the same time, to find more waiting at the Falls viewing platform, which was limited to 40 people per hour. Many visitors had so many very close encounters on roads and trails away from the bridge that few could appreciate the park's insistence on keeping the bridge closed until a rare time when all bears were 50 yards and moving away from the bridge (even using rangefinders to see they weren't a fraction of a yard closer than 50). Unacceptable! Get real and start walking - not rushing- people across the bridge frequently and in smaller groups.","July 22, 2017","Very special place for staying a few days, but hard to see much on a short day trip",76,Alaska,4

Brooks Falls,"What a show at Brook falls!  I heard a lot about Salmon run at Brooks fall and bear catching it. So I wanted to see them with own eyes. For me it was a costly affair $750 for tickets for day trip (from Anchorage to King Salmon by Penn Air and  from King Salmon  to Brooks Camp a short flight on a  float plane).   We arrived by 9.30 am and left at 5 pm.  It gave us enough time for lunch at the lodge and a drink while waiting for flight at lake.While landing by flight at Naknek lake we sow mother and two cubs (from 15 meter distance) strolling on the bank as if they were saying it's our place wait before stepping. We have to respect them and waited 15 minutes enjoying them taking strol and playing. What a welcome at Brooks camp. After mandatory bear orientation about  safety, We walked briskly to the upper platform to avoid rush and give us enough time to return in case of bear jam at river bridge. We had a 1 hour wait for upper platform and advised to go to waiting platform with buzzer to enable them to call when you turn comes.  We got some great views from a waiting platform. There were several bears fishing (counted 14). Within minutes, we saw a bear (from 10 meters, just below platform) dunk his head in water and caught a fish. He tear it apart and ate. Also saw  fight of bear to take strategic position and mother bear yielding and retreating.  We watched mother bear and 3 cubs walk back.  The upper platform is max 40 people but with camera gear it is crowded.  We had one full hour at upper bridge. It is lot of time to view bears at the falls. We saw four big bears at the falls with  salmon trying to cross fall.  We could capture picture of bear catching fish in mouth a rare shot one can get. I heard some one telling they could not get such a nice video even they stayed there for one night.While returning to camp at bridge we experienced bear jam. Safety first!  The bridge was closed by ranger due to  bear jam for one hour.  Mother bear and two cubs were playing near other end. One bear was coming towards our end and two more bears were fishing in a more family friendly and safer area. Katmai NP is literally in the middle of no where.   Very impressive to watch a bear catch and consume a salmon within a stone's throw. It is a dream place for everyone.

The Ranger teaches us all about the bears and what they are doing. Best to be well dressed for any weather because 3 hours is a long time in a Bear Jam. The waterfall platform was well supervised and gave us many hours if entertainment. Our wish was to see the bears catching salmon jumping UP the waterfall ... Yes. This is awesome.

Brooks Falls,"We spent three nights at the Brooks Lodge in order to view and photograph the bears at the falls. It was worth the effort! While late June isn't the high season for bears or salmon, it's also not the high season for people. There were about twenty bears in the area in late June and they made themselves pretty visible. The best time to observe them was early morning or in the evening. We had ample opportunity to view them: at the falls, at the riffles, at the bridge as well as in the camp itself. We had unlimited time at the falls platform, due to lack of human competition. My one regret was not photographing a bear swiping a salmon from the falls. This was more than offset by the lack of crowds.","July 12, 2017",Perfect in late June!,18,"Los Angeles, California",5

If the bears are nearby, the rangers have you wait. On the way there, we waited about 15 minutes. On the return from the Falls, we waited 1 1/2 hours, which meant our plane was very late in leaving. We didn't mind at all as it gave us a lot more time to take pictures. And boy did we every take pictures. If you love wildlife and photography, this is for you!! Again, the cost is very high but so worth it!! We purposely booked this flight many months in advance as they only fly a couple planes there daily. Also I asked Bald Mountain Air(our flight) when was the very best time to see the bears at the Falls, looking for salmon. They said the first part of July, so we went July 3rd.

It was pouring rain, but having come all this way, we went back after lunch to wait some more. (Lunch was pricey, but delicious, at the lodge. $18 for unlimited soup and salad.) Our patience was rewarded. When one bear lumbered out of the woods, everyone eagerly watched him catch a fish and eat it on a rock. Then another bear showed up. Then another. And another. At one point there were as many as NINE bears within view. Many of them stayed on the sidelines. It was clear there was a pecking order. A sow showed up with her three cubs, but they skedaddled quickly when she realized the dominant bears were present.I booked the tour through Katmailand. It was a day trip from Anchorage. I think if you dress appropriately, you can enjoy the bears in any weather.You're required to attend a brief ""Bear Orientation"" upon your arrival. Then you are allowed to walk to the falls. It's a 1.2 mile walk from the Visitor Center to the falls, but it's hard-packed gravel and not strenuous. It feels longer because the rangers scare you into believing a bear is going to jump out of the woods at any moment. (I completely understand why they do this.

Brooks Falls,"After watching the live web cams on Explore.org for the past four years, I fell in love with Brooks Falls and the bears that live there. Going to Brooks Camp and staying at Brooks Lodge was worth every penny that it cost to get there. The cost for my airline ticket from NC to Anchorage was $900, then from Anchorage you fly on Penn Air to King Salmon and that ticket was $635, then from King Salmon you fly to Brooks Camp on a floatplane at a cost of $206. You have three options at Brooks Camp: 1) Stay at the lodge at a rate of $1100/ PER CABIN PER NIGHT. 2) Camp in the campground and bring all of your gear and food with you (additional charges for extra bags on all three flights. 3) Take a Day Trip to Brooks Camp for $775. Day trippers arrive by about 10:30 a.m. and usually leave by 4-5 pm. That leaves about five hours to see the bears. Brooks Falls is a 1.2 mile walk from Brooks Camp so you have to figure that time into your short day. Now, you're down to about 4 hours. If you eat lunch at the Lodge, that can subtract another hour off of your precious time, putting you down to 3 hours. When you get to the Falls platform, if it has reached maximum capacity of 40 people at a time. You may have to wait up until an hour to get on the platform. Then, you will get one hour to see the bears. Day trippers run the risk of having very little time to see the bears and if it is a time when few bears are at the Falls, it could be very disappointing trip. I heard one person who was at Brooks Falls for a day trip who said that his plane was late leaving because of weather and by the time he got to the Falls, he only had 30 minutes to see the bears before his return flight was leaving. I would have been so upset if I paid $775 for 30 minutes. After considering the possibilities, I opted to stay at Brooks Lodge for four days $4,400 for a cabin for 4. We each split the cabin cost so it was $1,100 each. Meals aren't included and cost $74/day. Gratuities aren't included. I paid a guide $50, the dining hall crew $50 and another $50 for the lodge staff when I checked out. Excursions are also extra. I went to the Valley of 10,000 Smokes day tour ($96) and I hired a guide for 1/2 day ($145) to take me out on a boat and tour the area and then we went up to Brooks Lake to see a remote spot where some of the mothers and cubs fish. Souvenirs can easily add another $100 or more. Plus overweight luggage charges. The trip to Brooks Camp cost me nearly $4000 to see the bears. However, it was something that I will never forget. I saw so many mamas with cubs and the big male bears, as well as the ""teenage"" bears and a lost lone club. All totaled, I think I saw 49 total bears (including cubs). It was truly amazing. I was there Sept. 9-12, 2016 and it was the perfect time. There were bears at Brooks Falls fishing and multiple family groups of bears at the lower river fishing in a more family friendly and safer area.

The trails in the park are easy to walk and as the Rangers warn during bear safety training, you do have to watch for bears on the trail. We encountered a mama with two cubs and she was not too happy although we had plenty of time and space to back away until she went back into the trees - it delayed us for about 1/2 hour until it was safe to walk the path again. The bears at the falls provides great photo opportunities, in addition to the salmon and bald eagles in the area. You are allowed in the viewing platform only for a designated amount of time and then to go back again you put your name on the waiting list. It was about a two hour wait for us to go back to the viewing platform which allowed us to have lunch and come back. It was well worth the wait for what will likely be a once in a lifetime opportunity for us. The trip to Brooks Falls was pricey for the airfare but well worth it. If you visit Alaska nothing is cheap but it's usually worth it for the experience and all of the beauty that you will experience.

Brooks Falls,"My husband and I visited Brooks Falls during a weeks stay at Mission Lodge.. The purpose of the day was to fish for rainbows BUT our guide and my husband were patient while I photographed the Bears.. We have visited before, in July, bears are not usually plentiful during early September but we counted 11.. After a couple of hours of photography we proceeded to the river to fish.. My husband had a wonderful afternoon and caught several large rainbow trout.. Our last day and our best day.. What a great Alaskan adventure..","September 9, 2016",Nature at it's best..,23,"Panama City, Panama",5
Brooks Falls,"Two of us visited Brooks Falls last week during our tour of Alaska. It was one of the highlights of our trip, and although expensive it was worth every penny. The day started early - 7.30 flight out of Anchorage with Katmai Air on a 10 seater plane that took us to a dirt strip at Kulik, where we were transferred to a float plane for the final leg of the trip to Brooks Falls. It was a memorable journey in itself, as the taxiway from the Katmai Air terminal, just outside the main Anchorage Airport, crossed public roads before reaching the main runway. The flights took us through rugged mountain areas, with glaciers and volcanic cones, and the views were stunning. Brooks Falls is run by the National Park Service, and every arrival receives bear awareness training before being let loose. The trail to the falls is a little over a mile of easy walking, and the walkways and platforms inspire confidence. We were there in the lull between the main salmon runs, but still saw bears fishing. This included several solo males and a couple of family groups. Whilst waiting for the float plane out at the end of the day a mother and two cubs walked right through the lodge area. The whole experience was great - to see such large animals living free in the wild, but yet being so close (and feeling safe) was a humbling experience. The flights back were less memorable. We had been booked with Pen Air, which flies from Brooks to King Salmon, and then on to Anchorage in a much larger commercial plane. But it did allow us to experience Eddie's Inn, near the airport, where we had a most enjoyable meal whilst we waited for our onward flight. Brooks Falls is one of the iconic Alaskan experiences, and we were really pleased that we splashed out for it. A long day, but she won't forget it in a hurry.","September 7, 2016","Not just bears, but memorable small plane flights too",41,"Stamford, United Kingdom",5

Felt very safe with the guidance of the park rangers. Spent over 1 1/2 hours in total on the lookout mesmerized. Would highly recommend.

Brooks Falls,"Reading all the reviews, checking out the live bear cam online, looking at other visitors' pictures doesn't even come to close to actually being at Brooks Falls. Stepping out onto the upper platform for the first time and seeing 4 big males feasting took our breath away. We saw 14 bears that day including a couple of sows with cubs. We did the day trip from Anchorage, it is a long day, and expensive, but worth it! The flight over in the bush plane was an experience in itself! It's an easy 1.2 mile walk (not hike) to the upper platform and we had no wait, got there around 10am by the time the bear orientation was over. Several times on the way to the falls and back we were stopped by rangers due to a bear sitting on the trail, a sow with cubs swimming at the bridge we had to cross and another ""resting"" too near the trail. Erik, one of the rangers, was especially informative on bear facts.Lunch was better than expected at the lodge and reasonably priced by Alaska standards. You cannot have anything except plain water with you on the trail so as to not attract the bears. If you bring food/gum/mints/other drinks with you to Brooks Falls you will have to leave them behind in the food cache while out on the trails.Make sure to have cameras/go pros charged and ready to capture nature at its finest!!

Brooks Falls,The Grizzlies come to Brooks Falls every year to feed on the sockeye salmon in July and September. It is a 1.2 mile trail to get to the farthest viewing areas. Only 40 people are allowed to be on the platforms areas limited to one hour of viewing. After your hour you can sign up again. Have lunch at Brooks Lodge and return to the viewing area.The Bears are everywhere and they have the rightaway if you should meet on the trail.Floatplanes fly in and out all day long.It is very difficult to get a reservation for Brooks Lodge. You need to start 18 months ahead of desired date. We made our reservation 18 months ahead but still did not get into Brooks Lodging. We stayed at Kulik Fishing Lodge about a 25 minute flight away from Brooks. It turned out to be a blessing as we love to fish and like to enjoy the peace and quiet of Alaska. Brooks was similar to Yosemite as far as too many people coming and going. It is possible to take a day trip to Brooks Falls on a float plane out of King Salmon or even Anchorage. It is very expensive but worth every penny.I would like to add that we also had Bears near Kulik Lodge and saw a Lynx and a very large wolf. We fished for Lake and Rainbow trout-catch and release- fly fishing or trolling. The food was fantastic and the guides were the best. We were very well taken care of.

Brooks Falls,"Definitely a bucket list worthy destination. Katmai NP is literally in the middle of no where. It requires a float plane just to get there. However, if you go in July when the salmon are running you will be rewarded with bears catching salmon. The National Park service has built a platform near the falls that keeps you and the bears safe. Very impressive to watch a bear catch and consume a salmon within a stone's throw.","July 24, 2016",Bears Catching Salmon,49,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Day 1 we watched the bears, then back to King Salmon overnight, then back on the floatplane for day 2's bus tour of the Valley of 10,000 Smokes. We were there 4/5 July and saw maybe 8-10 bears at the falls, with a wait of about 45 minutes to get onto the main viewing platform. We loved the atmosphere inside the lodge - we enjoyed the buffet style food and sitting around the fire.

We spent two days there and it totally delivered. We saw plenty of bears, including two mums each with three cubs.It's more than a mile to walk from Brooks Lodge to the falls but it's flat so not strenuous. No food or drink are allowed outside the lodge so you have to walk back there at lunchtime.

You wait on the next platform down, which also has views of the falls (little farther away) and likely bears in the river in front of this platform (if peak season). We thought the rangers were nice. To avoid crowds, stay the night and be there early in the morning or go late afternoon.

While waiting you can hang out at the Ripples platform and watch for bears in the river. We saw great activity from both platforms. Arrive early, if possible, get your name on the list and have lunch once finished. We found that the platform clears a bit by having a late lunch. Beware of photographers with tripods!! They are quite aggressive and will shove you around to try and get a ""prime"" location. Definitely an experience to repeat!

Brooks Falls,"This is a great place that has the event spoiled by a few things that are poorly managed. We got to see bears eating salmon at the falls....very good. We spent a lot of money to fly over there, walk to the site, get put on a waiting list, wait for almost two hours on a warm day and then were limited to 1 hour of watching bears at the ""upper"" viewing platform,,,,,Not so good... We had to deal with rude employees guarding the gate. They had a poor system of calling up people on the list and got testy if you asked where you stood at any given time......Not so good. I guess when you wait on a warm day for that amount of time, it is not reasonable to wonder where you are on the list....Not so good. For most people, this is the first and only time to visit this site. The arrogant and rude treatment of those customers is not only unreasonable, it is hard to understand. On the other hand, these employees do this every day. If the job seems that hard, and it is difficult to find a better system, maybe they need a different job......one not funded by taxpayers. I would not waste the money to visit this site. Pull up the web cam and save yourself a lot of aggravation and a few thousand dollars.

Brooks Falls,"The number one thing we wanted to do on our first trip to Alaska was Brooks Falls. After finding the Brooks Falls live bear cam and doing a bit of research, I knew we had to go. I was unable to book a night at the lodge because it was already sold out. I guess, if you would like to stay at the lodge, you have to book the day (more like the minute) bookings open. I missed that. So we planned a day trip through Katmai Air (another review). We got to King Salmon an hour and a half late due to fog, but after a short float plane trip we really only were about 30 minutes late from our scheduled time. Our first view once we got off of the plane we saw a mother bear and a cub several hundred of yards away on the shore. We walked to the lodge and after a short (and fun) mandatory bear orientation we started our walk to the falls. Almost immediately we came to the lower river area (also on one of the cams) and we could see hundreds of Sockeye swimming around near the walkway (bridge) over the river. Several people were fly fishing there as well. We talked with a Ranger (Daniel, one of the live chat cam rangers) who was very friendly and enthusiastic. We continued our short (just over a mile) walk to the platforms. On the way there, you can see bear scat everywhere, so keep your eye open for bears. We never saw one on the path, but we just missed a mother and cubs sleeping on the path on our way back. We did not get trapped by the bear jam then, lol.Once at the platforms you give a ranger your name and wait until your name is called to go up to the falls. in the meantime, we walked down to the Riffles platform. There was so much to see at the riffles that we never felt like we were missing anything waiting for the falls. Bears where all over the Riffles. They were lunging at salmon (which was really entertaining to watch). Several walked over to our shore and ate the salmon right in front of us. A mother with three cubs showed up right next to the platform. She tree'd all three of her cubs when a male came a bit to close. It is amazing the hight those three little cubs got in that tree. It also provided everyone with some awesome photo opportunities. Several bears also appeared out of the forest (right next to the platform) and decided it was time to go fishing in the riffles.After about 2 hours, our name was called to go to the falls. I think we had at least 5 or 6 bears in the falls fishing. One with two cubs off to the side. She caught a salmon mid air, walked over to her cubs and shared it with them. Two big males almost got into a fight right in front of us, but one ran off. Needless to say, so many photo opportunities. For anyone wondering, my lens is just a Tamron 16-300 lens. It was more than enough for me. Got some great pics. So, you don't need a pro lens to get closeups for us consumer photographers.The only thing I think could be improved is if there was some way to notify people or give a time for when you name is called for the falls. I felt as if I couldn't leave that platform and walk back to the lodge or lower river area for fear of missing our name to be called to the falls. However, not a huge deal because of what you are seeing while there.If you decide you want to see bears, go to Brooks Falls. It was an amazing experience and a great time with the family.","July 17, 2016",Brooks Falls First Week of July,24,"Mount Prospect, Il",5

Brooks Falls,We flew to Katmai from Anchorage with Rust's. There is a MANDATORY bear orientation. Listen and remember. It could save your life. We walked briskly to the upper platform. Take water! We had a 2 hour wait. You can get some great views from a waiting platform but it is crowded. The upper platform is max 40 people but with camera gear it is crowded. This is the view you see in most bear catching salmon photos. There were several bears fishing and in only minutes we saw a bear dunk his head in and get a fish. Success. We walked back stopping at the toilets (orientation) and caught up to a couple walking away from a mama bear. We reminded them that in the orientation they said to get OFF the trail. So we backed into the woods about 50 ft (talking loudly) and watched the bear and 3 cubs walk by staring at us. Safety first! The bridge was closed due to more bears. Quite an eventful day.

Brooks Falls,"There is nothing like being able to watch, not just see, the coastal brown bears as they catch salmon at Brooks Falls. Though platforms are busy in July, the park service rotates vistors off the main viewing platform hourly. A person can put their name on a list and return there within a short time frame. In the meantime, while waiting you can view bears from the riffles platform. Park service staff monitor where the bears are in relation to the camp and the bridge and the falls trail. Visitors must sometimes wait for the bears to move on before park staff allow people to get from one point to another. As noted in my Brooks Lodge review, I would recommend staying at the lodge or campsite rather than only taking a day trip to Brooks Falls.

They have a hard enough time trying to catch enough food to survive through the winter. Though I saw and experienced some amazing sites, the large number of people crowding the platforms and trails with many bears visibly unsettled by our presence I was left with a feeling of being intrusive. It isn't a place I would want to visit again. ","July 13, 2016",For the bears...or should be. ,11,"Alexandria, Virginia",3
Brooks Falls,"We were at Brook Falls June 29-July 1. Our journey started with a flight from Anchorage to King Salmon, then a float plane to Brooks Lodge. Flying, especially on small planes is not my thing, but it was not near as bad as I was expecting. It was my first time landing on water and it was smooth. It was the most amazing experience we have ever had. I cannot imagine another place on earth were you can see so many wild bear, together in very close proximity, in their natural environment. The most we saw at one time in the river was 14 bear. It is interesting to learn the hierarchy amongst them. The salmon were just starting, and the changes we saw in the number of fish in the three days we were there was amazing. We were fortunate to go just before the July 4th weekend. Once July hits the number of tourists goes up. There is a limit of 40 people on the viewing platform at one time, so you are allowed one hour and then have to move to another area to give others a chance. If there are less then 40 people you can stay as long as you want. The platforms are open until 10:00 pm. If you have to move off of the falls platform there is another one just down the river from it. The younger bears hang out down there and run and dive in the water to catch the fish. They are very fun to watch. We found the evening the best time to view the most bear, as well the day trippers have all left so there are only a few people there. The lodge has a wonderful buffet for breakfast, lunch, and supper. Lots of variety, and the food was tasty. There is also a bar where you can get a drink and sit around a fire pit inside the lodge. There are lots of interesting people to meet and the staff are very friendly.There is a bit of a walk from the lodge to the falls, but it is flat ground and easy to do. Bug spray is handy and maybe some after bite as well. This was an experience that will be hard to beat.

Brooks Falls,"My daughter and I spent a few days at Brooks Camp last summer, starting off a two week Alaskan adventure. In a way it almost ruined the rest of the trip because all we could talk about was Brooks and the bears! After being spoiled seeing so many bears in such close proximity at Brooks it just wasn't very exciting to see a lone grizzly 1/4 mile away while sitting on a crowded bus in Denali. We just had to laugh! My advice is to save Brooks for the last part of your trip if possible. Alaska is amazingly, stunningly beautiful and time spent at Brooks will be the icing on the cake.I want to acknowledge the park rangers who keep this place safe for us to visit. I really didn't know what to expect and it kind of reminded me of Jurassic Park! There are many rangers here, all in constant communication with each other to report on bear activity and make sure that people and bears are safe. My daughter was 9 at the time of our visit and they really were sweet to her and patient with her questions. You could tell everyone who was working really loved their job. My daughter now wants to grow up and move to Alaska and be a ranger at Katmai! If you are bringing kids the Junior Ranger program will help keep them busy and the pin they get is the nicest of all the National Parks, which makes a treasured souvenir.This place is so amazing and special, I hope to come back in a few years.","February 2, 2016",Unbelievable!,27,"La Mesa, California",5
Brooks Falls,"One of the things i was looking forward to most about my trip to Alaska was being able to see animals in their natural habitats. When i saw there was a day trip available i knew this had to be on our to do list. The trip starts off with a plane trip to king salmon and then a float plane trip to brooks camp. The float plane trip was beautiful even though I am not a big fan of small planes. When we landed at brooks camp we were shown a short film on bear safety, given a badge and then off we went to find bears. There are camp employers located in many different parts of the camp that are happy to answer any questions you have which i thought was a great touch. On the day we went we only saw one bear but we were happy with that as you can never guarantee that you are going to see one. One piece of advice i will give is make sure that you bring good walking shoes. We did a lot of walking on the day we went making sure that we were in the right place to see the bears. If you can i would also recommend staying overnight. Doing the day trip was great but to give you the best chance of seeing bears i would suggest staying more then one day.","December 12, 2015",Amazing place to view bears!!,42,New Zealand,5

Brooks Falls,"This is an amazing place for many reasons. You can get very close to grizzly bears in their natural habitat. There are secured viewing platforms, but we also had encounters hiking to/from the platforms and around the camp. It's great to have that experience and the complete flexibility to make your own schedule, don't have to worry about timing for a group, etc. We went at very beginning of the season. As such, there were much fewer people which was nice. However, there were also fewer salmon. So, you take the good with the bad.We stayed in a cabin which was very nice. It was quite nice to have a warm and dry cabin when the rains come (which they often do in Alaska). If you don't bring your own food, the lodge has decent to good food options, but expensive.

They were very active at night with fights over fish and fishing rights.There were plenty of bears during the day too. There were two sets of moms with cubs that came to the falls, sometimes fishing down river at the riffles. We camped two nights, which was good because it gave us more time than a day trip. It is less crowded on the viewing platforms when the day trippers leave. If you love seeing brown bears it is a must do! We were there July 19th and were told the peak was beginning to wane.

Our first trip in 2002 was in July, when there were bears literally everywhere. This time we went in early August. The bears were few in number, but we enjoyed watching them. I'm glad we did not go any later in the year than early August, though. Katmai is expensive, but it's very worth it. It's a wildlife photographer's heaven. The Rangers are knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. They seem to really enjoy the guests. Food is pricey (even by the they-have-to-fly-it-in standards), but they do have secure (from bears) storage if you bring some of your own. The rooms are basic, but clean, but that's fine, because you're not there to see the room. Because the buildings were constructed at a time when sound insulation wasn't common, it's best to bring ear plugs for uninterrupted sleeping.

Brooks Falls,"We visited Brooks falls on Sept 8&9, 2015. If you set your expectations correctly, September is actually a good time to visit. You won't see a lot of bears - but you will see bears, usually just one or two males at a time or a female with her cubs. To get that perfect photo of a bear catching a salmon at the falls, you will have to be patient. On September 8, when we first visited the falls, there were no bears there - ZERO! When we came back later that day, there were still no bears there, but we waited around and our patience paid off. We had several hours of watching the bear catch fish - and I do have some great photos. Near the lodge and downstream we saw a mother with cubs and I have a video of the cubs playing together, We also saw LOTS of Salmon. In July, there are many more bears at the falls, but there are also many, many more people. In September, we sometimes had the falls viewing platform all to ourselves. In July you will have to share it with hundreds of people. So would you rather be part of a crowd watching lots of bears, or one of a few, watching fewer bears. We chose that later and were not disappointed with the experience.","September 13, 2015",A September Visit,27,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",5

You have to fly to king salmon first then to brooks falls they have there own float plane service which is excellent. If you what to see many bears then July is the best time to go this is when the salmon are there agian is September but it rain more then.","September 1, 2015",Trip to Alaska,31,swindon,5
Brooks Falls,"Fantastic experience. The National Park is only accessible by sea plane. We saw a bear walking along the beach as soon as we landed! We then were lucky enough to see about 15 bears during the day. The national park is set up excellently. A good briefing at the start, a safe place to store your food and park rangers at regular intervals but without impeding on your visit. We could have spent days at the falls watching the bears catch salmon - truly amazing experience. Listen to the advise to keep making noise so as not to surprise the bears....we walked straight into three bears walking along the path! It was an incredible experience....on reflection once we were safe! Fantastic place to see bears in the wild, highly recommended and worth the money to get there","August 30, 2015",Simply Amazing,92,"Sydney, Australia",5
Brooks Falls,"If you go in July you would see a lot more bears feasting on the sockeye salmon.Definitely worth it only accessible by sea plane .You can purchase lunch from the lounge which has a great fire place for those chilly days.You need to book approx 12 months a head for peak season expect it to be busy if staying at the lodge , day trips available .","August 25, 2015",Best month July,130,"Mackay, Australia",4
Brooks Falls,"great place to watch bears catching salmon. Salmon going upriver become easy prey to bears who wait either above or below the falls. Each bear has different techniques of catching salmon, and less dominant and baby bears wait further down the river. Two platforms to watch bears, the main one is Falls platform and further down, Riffles platform. It is best if you can stay overnight as it is quieter after day visitors leave.","August 25, 2015",Best place to watch bears catching salmon,34,"Leawood, Kansas",5
Brooks Falls,"I went on a day trip and the float plane trip was amazing (a bit wiggly on the way back as the weather changed).I loved the whole structure of the viewing areas and was very impressed that the NParks are making sure that the bears don't associate people with food. We almost got frisked before we were allowed off the plane. Even flavoured Lipeze! If the bears smell food on people they will then be more likely to attack and then this forms these bad habits. Lunch which was provided by the company and was really large and good, was eaten in an enclosure. The bins are stored in a room. It is an expensive trip, but well worth it, as I got to see about 12 bears, at times very very close and other times, catching salmon from the waterfall. One of the highlights of my trip to Alaska.","August 21, 2015","In mid July I spent 15 days in Alaska and thoroughly enjoyed my 8 tours, this being one of my favourites",5,"Valla Beach, Australia",4
Brooks Falls,"I would prefer the title as ""the BEST place on earth"" over ""a wonderful place"", but I would be technically incorrect not having been to similar falls other than the Russian River Fall near Cooper Landing. But I think that Brooks Fall's campion title will be extremely difficult to beat given its geography, well-established infrastructure and abundance of wildlife. We have benefitted tremendously from the TA community in our trip planning and would like to share our experience with others who will be going after us.When to Go?- This was the most difficult part of our planning. From what we learnt, the bears normally spend 4 weeks fishing in Brooks River before moving on. The tricky question is which 4 weeks as it all depends on when the salmon run begins. My 2 cents' worth of opinion is to bet on the period between Jul 11-24 and you should be ""safe"" whether the run starts early or late. But at the end of the day, it all depends on mother nature. We spent 3 days there - Jul 15-17.- Another period, we heard, will be Sept. There will be lots of bears. But the salmon will be all dead then. So the bears won't be ""fishing"", just picking up the dead fishes.How to Get There?You can fly there from Anchorage (via King Salmon) or Homer. There maybe other means that I didn't know.Where to Stay?- Brooks Lodge (owned by Katmailand) or Brooks Camp. They are the closest to the Fall. I tried in vain to book Brooks Lodge 9 months in advance. Heard people say that Brooks Camp is even more difficult to book. That is, if you want to book the prime time of July 2016, you may be already too late. Anyway, go ahead and try now!- Kulik Lodge (also owned by Katmailand), excellent but pricey. They will fly you daily to Brooks Fall. Flight is only 30mins (1-way) and very scenic. We stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much.How Long is Needed?- You can do a day trip to Brooks Fall from Anchorage or Homer by air. Technically speaking, you only need one day. However, you will only have a few hours in Brooks Fall and even less hours at the viewing platform. So it will be a matter of hit and miss. Remember, even in the middle of the salmon run, it doesn't run non-stop 24-hours/day, 7 days/week for tourist! If no salmon, even if the bears are still around, they won't be fishing which is the best part of the viewing.- My 2 cents is to spend 2 days in Brooks Fall if you afford the time and budget. It will always be a matter of probability - the more time you spend, the more you will see. We are crazy about wildlife, so we stayed for 3 days and enjoyed every minute of it. But that's us.What Will You See?We can only tell you what we saw. - Day 1: Sunny. One hour each in the morning and afternoon at the upper platform. Salmon run was strong. We were overwhelmed by what we saw. 12 bears at the fall performing fishing skills of all kinds - diving, charging, snorkeling, robbing and the famous waiting for salmon jumping into the mouth. A sow with 3 cubs were fishing very hard - tough to be a mom! Not being a good photographer, I literally took a thousand photos - quantity instead of quality :-(. - Day 2: Raining. Spent same time on the platform as Day 1. Salmon was not running. There were only 3-4 bears and they were much less active than Day 1. However, we enjoyed watching the interactions between a sub-adult bear and the dorminant bear. It was also the only day we saw a sow with her 4 tiny cubs. The photos not too good due to lack of sunlight.- Day 3: Cloudy in the morning, salmon run was pretty weak. Fortunately, the sun and salmon run re-surfaced in the afternoon. The bear count went back to 12 and acitivities quickly intensified. Took some very good photos which were missing in Day 1.How many viewing platforms are there?- The prime platform is the upper platform which is located right next to the fall. You need to sign up with rangers and wait for your turn of an 1-hour viewing time.- Next best is the lower platform, no waiting required. Sighting is also quite good. While the big and dorminant bears occupy the best locations at the falls, other bears and especially sows with cubs fish near the lower platform, hence a good place to watch the cubs.- Lower river platform: at the mouth of Brooks River. The scenery here is quite good, but don't expect to see any similar number of bears at the fall.Is it like a zoo?Absolutely not! All the bears roam free in the area. It is great that the viewing platforms were built so that we can all enjoy the viewing in a much better manner. As a matter of fact, on the 0.6 mile narrow trail to the platform, we ran into 2 bears crossing the trail. We also have been stopped twice by rangers due to ""bear jam"". Some small suggestions:- If, for some reasons, you didn't book the bear viewing tours in advance, you can still take a spontaneous decision upon arriving Anchorage/Homer given there is still availabilty. But before laying down your deposit, you should take a good look at the web cams. If it showed no salmon nor bears, then you should act wisely.- Take your rain gear and keep it in your back pack always.Best luck and enjoy :-)))!!!","August 18, 2015","A wonderful place to see brown bears fishing and ""forced"" socialization!",156,"Hong Kong, China",5
Brooks Falls,"It is a hassle to get to Katmai, it is expensive (especially if one has to stay overnight in a close by village like King Salmon). BUT if you want to see the bears in their natural environment during the salmon run....this is the place. There is a fair amount of freedom of movement in the park, but one has ample opportunity to view the bears on the Falls. No comparison between this attraction vs Neets Bay bear viewing at Ketchikan. My advice....take the extra time and spend the money.

Brooks Falls,"I just read the low rating reviews to find out how anyone could not find this place incredible and it turned out that they hadn't gone at the right time. You have to get here for the salmon run - that means June into July, and September. We were there mid-July and it was simply amazing. There were 15 bears at the falls, they were running around underneath us. We saw all the various salmon-catching strategies different bears adopt. The poor salmon had the most gruesome death as the bears don't bother killing them before they start eating them - usually by ripping off strips of skin followed by the tail (the fish are still flapping at this point). If you're at all squeamish then you may not want to take binoculars for those salmon close-ups (you don't need them to see the bears as you're so close).We stayed at the Brooks Camp overnight which meant we got to go to the Falls in the evening after dinner (it's light till very late) and there were more bears, more salmon and fewer people than there had been in the afternoon. We also saw a mother and her four (count 'em!) spring cubs. I'd say you still get to see plenty if you do a day trip but it certainly feels less rushed and more exclusive staying overnight.We had our kids with us and they were told they could fill in a booklet and become Junior Rangers, which they duly did. They then have to take an oath with a Ranger proper and are given a badge, which in Katmai is a lovely metal one, and the kids were delighted.The flight in on the float plane is great fun too. The whole thing is like being in your own nature documentary. Quite unbelievably brilliant.","August 3, 2015",Worth every penny,236,"London, United Kingdom",5
Brooks Falls,"This was the highlight of our trip to Alaska. We also took the day trip with Katmailand, flying from Anchorage to King Salmon and then on to Brooks Lake in a 5-passenger float plane. After going through bear school and earning our graduation pin, we were set loose to explore the park and falls on our own. To get to the falls, the bears often walk the same 2-mile path as the tourists, so we were glad we had the bear training when we came close and personal to a couple of them on the path. In early July, the salmon were just starting to run, but we saw as many as 6 bears at the falls at the same time, each with a different fishing technique, which was explained by the rangers on hand to answer questions. It was especially exciting to see the ones who catch the salmon as the fish attempt to jump up the falls. The trip was a bit expensive, about $650 per person from Anchorage, but well worth it.","August 2, 2015",Best Bear-Watching Experience,6,Central Florida,5
Brooks Falls,"We took a day trip with Katmailand to Katmai National Park/Brooks Falls. It was very pricey, but worth it. Our day started at a small hangar on Lake Hood near Anchorage airport. We boarded a small plane (one pilot, 7 passengers) and flew about 1.5 hours to a small remote fishing village where we changed planes to an even smaller sea plane. We flew for about 30 minutes into Brooks Lake at Katmai National Park. We learned how to be safe around bears from a ranger and we spent the day watching bears! It was quite an adventure! Only downside was the return flight home through King Salmon was in a dumpy little airport and the PennAir plane was delayed. It was a small jet - not nearly as fun and exciting as the other planes on our adventure!","August 1, 2015",Amazing day trip,91,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Brooks Falls,"Given the cost, many will wonder if Brooks Falls is worth it? Absolutely. I have travelled the world and seen many beautiful spots with wildlife including two safaris in Africa and Brooks Falls is one of the greatest adventures I have been on. Being so close to so many huge brown bears that are actively fishing and interacting with each other is absolutely a blast. And while the platforms can be crowded during the high season there is more than enough room to be both comfortable and take all the photos you could ever want. The park service does a great job of running this facility and their iron discipline on managing food sources to keep bears from associating food with humans has managed to make this a safe experiance. I highly recommend Brooks Falls.","July 31, 2015",A once in a lifetime experiance,29,"Arlington, Virginia",5

Brooks Falls,"My husband and I went to Brooks Falls for a day trip in early July to see the bears. It was our first flight in a float plane so that kick started our excitement.The salmon had definitely arrived at the mouth of the creek but hardly any were jumping at the falls. However, we saw at least 6 different bears wondering around the Brooks Falls area in search of the salmon. The main action on the day that we were there, seemed to be at the second platform downstream from the falls as this is where we saw several fish get caught. Since it was early in the season the bears were very protective of their catches and one brought his catch out of the creek and came and sat under the observation deck to eat his prize! We went back to Brooks Lodge for a buffet lunch which I thought was pretty average. This trip cost a lot of money but I loved every minute that I could spend watching the bears.","July 29, 2015",Had a bear eating a fish directly below me!,46,"Brisbane, Australia",5

Brooks Falls,"We went to Brooks Falls July 8th on a day trip. We made our reservations through Katmailand. Flew from Anchorage to King Salmon then on a float plane to Brooks Camp. We started seeing bears from the float plane. 3 bears asleep on the beach. The day was wonderful! Bears everywhere. We did the falls platform twice and the riffles platform 3 times. Even thought the falls platform is the preferred, we got wonderful photos from the riffles platform too (actually since the young bears hang out there some of the photos were more interesting). We were lucky enough to be there by the lower river platform when a mother bear brought her 4 babies out for the first time. Great end for the day. The only advice I would give is to plan your meals wisely. Only water can be taken out of the camp. We ate on the plane to King Salmon and then during the bear orientation (Peanut butter and crackers and peanuts). Stayed out with the bears for as long as we could, then grabbed a snack in the gift shop before our flight back. This worked for us and we didn't miss time seeing the bears. The expense was worth it for the experience we enjoyed.","July 24, 2015",Bears!,5,"Benton, Kentucky",5
Brooks Falls,"This is my second year visiting Brooks Camp inside of Katmai National Park. Both were amazing. The setting is very unique in that you are able to view brown bears safely as they fish for salmon in the Brooks River. Each year I flew in on Katmailand Air. They are a great float plane operation, and they also operate the Brooks Lodge inside of Brooks Camp. I have stayed in the campground each year and eaten some of my meals at Brooks Lodge. This makes a week of camping a bit more enjoyable as the food at the lodge is awesome. The staff of the lodge is very accommodating and friendly. I noticed this even more in 2015 than I did in 2014. Everyone is genuine and down to earth, able to help you with questions, advice, and provide excellent service. I have not yet stayed in the lodge, however in talking with lodge guests they seemed to be very happy. Please be aware they have a 3 night maximum stay at the lodge and a 7 day maximum stay in the campground, so plan accordingly. The day trip to the Valley of 10,000 Smokes is a great way to break up all the bear viewing you will experience. Katmailand and Brooks Lodge is well run and friendly operation.The National Park Service is pretty good as most of the rangers are very friendly ( one supervisor ranger was unfriendly and played the role of the classic bureaucrat and chose to reprimand her staff instead of deal with the situation herself as a good leader would). Besides this one ranger though I found all the other rangers to be friendly and helpful and demonstrate a positive attitude. It is not an easy job keeping an eye on tourists in close proximity to a larger number of brown bears. To do so with a positive, non-authoritarian, approach was pleasant to see.Bring your camera, enjoy the wonderful food and service at Brooks Lodge, and get to see these beautiful bears up close.","July 21, 2015",Great place to see brown bears and more,53,"Santa Fe, New Mexico",5

Brooks Falls,"The tour is expensive, as there is no road access to the park, and unless you are extremely lucky you wont get a lodge to stay in the park. So basically for most of people it's a day trip and you will fly in and out through a float plane. We were there at about 11am and will have to leave by 5pm, so our time was limited. Without any delay, after the bear orientation we went to the falls. There you have to wait in line (putting your name on paper and Ranger will call your name when it's your time), and you could spend waiting time on the Riffle Platform to watch bears from distance, to get yourself ready. If there are people waiting, your time at the falls will be limited to one hour, which is not bad, and you could put your name right back on after your time is up, and wait for another chance. We visited Jul 12th and spent a total of two hours on the platform, saw about 15 bears at one time, and a bear was catching the jumping salmon. You are awfully close too, I guess it is about 30 yards or so, between the platform and the falls. You don't even need good lenses for good pictures, an iphone would probably get the job done. (I am kidding, you probably want to bring a good camera for this ^_^) The experience is impressive, amazing, spectacular, once a lifetime, you name it. I don't mind spending money on such things. I loved it.Be sure to check their live webcam, which is fascinating, for the bear activities before you book your trip. Also they have every piece of info you would need before you go, especially when and where the bears are during the year. Salmons are only there during July (alive) and Sep (dead), so be prepared. http://www.nps.gov/katm/planyourvisit/upload/Bear-Viewing-at-Brooks-Camp.pdfhttp://www.nps.gov/katm/faqs.htmIf you didn't do your homework and come back with disappointment and thus give the park a 1 star, because you didn't see any bears, I would suggest you go to the zoo in your hometown instead where you are guaranteed to see some kind of bears.","July 16, 2015",Money is nothing compared what you saw there,21,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Brooks Falls,"After visiting the falls, you push shut the gate on an elevated walkway behind, see bear trails all over the place and realize you've stepped into their environment and are essentially buck-naked. Unbelievable and breathtaking experiences. Here is a challenge. Even if you go when the salmon are running, you might not see any bears feasting. Salmon run early or late in the season, with each year being different. Then they school at the mouth of the river before running en mass in waves or pulses up to improve their survival chances over singletons. Early in our 2.5d stay, little bear or salmon action, but that first night, some salmon were being caught in the ""jacuzzi"" below the falls. (be sure to talk with the NPS personnel, as they are highly knowledgeable and very willing to share marvelous stories about all the various bears, their person-bear-alities, etc). Then in the lowlands near the lodge that night, there were charges back and forth, salmon thievery, roars, bluffs. What a show! Finally a major run of salmon happened sometime the second night, but that third AM, they were sated and sleeping out of sight, entrails around the falls telling you that the seagulls also were stuffed to the bills, and no bear-fishing going on while 120-140 salmon/hr jumping. Best advice is a 2-3 night stay during the salmon runs to assure time to enjoy the experience, soak it in, and at least one great encounter with multiple bears. Also realize that the quietest time is evenings as the daytrippers come early in the AM, some by 0700, but they're gone after dinner.","July 8, 2015","Out of the cage, into the bears' den",43,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Brooks Falls,"This is a great place to be almost guaranteed to see bears during the season that the salmon run upstream to spawn. Timing is important as the salmon do not follow calendars. Mid to late July are usually best.. We were lucky, we went on July 4th and we saw four bears in the falls waiting for almost non-existent salmon. We only saw two trying to jump in an hours time. The bears were also disappointed with that and left hungry. We also enjoyed (at least I did) when a rather large mama bear and her three cubs wandered into the main area where we were having a picnic lunch by the seaplane docks. After a healthy commotion picking up the food, she was verbally coerced by a young park ranger into bypassing the area as she made her way along the coast. She was never belligerent, but she was definitely an imposing figure. As to getting there, the options are limited to seaplanes as are a lot of attractions in Alaska. Alaskan weather is very unpredictable and seaplanes are like feathers in the wind. You must be able to withstand the occasional rough ride (think big roller coasters without rails). We were unlucky enough to have that and 100% fog.. The pilot had to get through a mountain range using instruments only.. Having gone through in the clear earlier only heightened our anxiety knowing how close mountains are and how relatively narrow the valleys are. We survived but we all thought the worse while going through it especially having heard of a very recent and terrible plane accident that happened under similar circumstances just south of our flight area. Just food for thought. Still worth going to and seeing. Just know what you are possibly getting into.","July 5, 2015",The Place to See Bears in Alaska,23,"Miami, Florida",5
Brooks Falls,"Brooks Lodge is a special place where you can closely view brown coastal bears in a developed environment. If you have never seen bears before in the wild, this is a great place to visit. It can be very crowded. If you a natural outdoors person, you may want to visit a more natural location. This has a great infrastructure built up to accommodate people in a comfortable way. To get to Brooks Lodge (if booked directly with Brooks Lodge) you will typically fly from Anchorage to King Salmon on a plane which seats 30 people. The flight is approximately 1 hour. Once you reach King Salmon you will be greeted by Katmai Air and bused a couple miles to the float plane. There you will board a plane that holds 6-12 people. The flight is approximately 20-30 minutes. Once you arrive at Brooks you will be greeted by a Park Ranger that will take you to the bear safety orientation that lasts about 20 minutes. Then you are free to explore the park staying at least 500 yards from the bears at all times. About half of the visitors are from the USA and half from Europe and Asia. Many of the visitors speak minimal English, so be alert for safety instructions. The lodge is made up of about 10 individual cabins and about 10 rooms that are in one lodge building. Brooks assigns the rooms before you arrive, so there is no way to request a standalone cabin. The lodge is nice if people follow the guidance like not flushing the toilets during sleeping hours. My lodge neighbors were very considerate. The only noise I heard at night was the neighbors snoring. During the day, you can hear neighbors talking, but it was not an issue. Bring ear plugs and / or a small fan if noise is a concern. Each room has 2 sets of bunk beds, one small desk with a metal folding chair, shower, sink and toilet. The toilet is behind a door. There is a curtain you can pull to close off the sink and shower area. The beds are comfortable, there is a very thin bed spread, additionally a blanket folded at the foot of the bed. There are two electrical plug boxes. It was helpful having an extension cord, so I did not have to crawl behind the bed to plug in my chargers. On the front porch there is a wooden bench without a back, not very comfortable for relaxing. The lower platform is approximately a 10 minute walk from the lodges / cabins. It is about a 25 minute walk from the cabins to the upper platform. The main lodge building is where meals are served. Breakfast is from about 7-8:30am, 11:30-1:30pm and 5:30-7:30pm. Meals are about $18-25 each. You can may for each meal separately or charge to your room and pay when you check out. The bar is open until 11pm. Each meal generally has one meat entrée, a starchy vegetable such as rice or potatoes, one vegetable, one or two soups, salad bar and a couple dessert selections. You can also bring your own food and eat in the picnic area. There is a building where you can store your food or extra gear. A general store also sells t-shirts, candy bars, drinks, etc. Water is $2.75 for a 16 ounce bottle. Candy is $1.25. There are a few other snacks, but very limited. Open from 7am-5pm (a couple hours later in July). During July, you can stay in the cabin a maximum of 3 nights and 7 nights in the campground. We stayed two nights and it was a good amount of time. There are three viewing platforms. The one at the falls, a second platform just below the falls, the falls can be seen from here. The second falls platform is a great place to watch the juvenile bears catching fish. These platforms are opened from 7am to 10pm. If there is a wait to get on the falls platform you can wait on the second falls platform. When there is a wait, you can view from the falls platform for one hour. Once you leave, you can immediately re-sign up and view from the secondary falls platform. The rangers do a good job of managing the people and waitlist. The lower platform does not close. In June / July, there is day light almost 24 hours a day. It does get dusky from about midnight to 4am.  It can be very crowded when the day trippers are in, so the best time to view the bears is after the day trippers are gone. The day trippers are generally there from 10am -3pm. My favorite time to view was 7am – noon and after 4pm to avoid the crowds.The salmon generally run in the month of July. We arrived on June 29. Others told us there were loads of salmon were jumping on Saturday, June 27. Yet on June 29, there were no salmon, the bears kept visiting the falls looking for the salmon to come back. On June 30, there were salmon swimming in the lower lake, but not at the falls. On July 1, salmon were jumping at the falls again. We understand that fishing was opened to commercial fishing at the end of June which could have caused the absence of fish for a few days. Even with the limited fish, we got view many bears. One day, we had 10 individual bears. We had the opportunity to see three of the alpha male bears along with several bold juvenile bears and one female. We did not see any sows with cubs although they had been seen prior to our arrival. The camp ground is very nice. There is an electric fence around it. There is a nice drop toilet within the electric fence area, along with three picnic and cooking pavilions. The tent sites are approximately 10-20 feet from each other with tall grass in between, which makes the sites are very private. There is a public shower in the lodge area (20 minute walk), you can purchase a token to access shower hot water. The camp ground is about an additional 20-30 minute walk to access the viewing platforms that the lodge to the platforms. Hopefully, this review will help you plan your trip. If you find it helpful, please “like” it to encourage additional detailed reviews.","July 5, 2015",Great place for first time bear viewing - can be very crowded,115,"Dallas, Texas",4
Brooks Falls,"I flew out to Brooks on June 30, 2015 with Rust's Flying Service. As an Alaskan seeing the bears at Brooks is one of my favorite things to do here. I'd been there before, a number of times, the last time being 10 years ago, however this last trip has to rank as one of my favorites! Even though my husband has been a bush pilot for over 40 years, my pilot this day, Glen Curtis was every bit as confident, careful and capable, and I have to admit somewhat more accomplished as he also pilots jet planes. Not only did I luck out in pilots but in planes and weather as well. I flew out in Rust's fastest plane, the Caravan getting to Brooks in less than 1.5 hours, in my husband's 185 it's over 2.5 hours. The landings and takeoffs were ever so smooth with Curtis--there's nothing like taking off and landing on water, an experience most are enthralled with. Curtis made the trip extra special by pointing out various landmarks along the way going and coming back and made sure that we had the opportunity to ask any question we'd want, and he always had an answer. Curtis wasn't just a pilot for our group, he also was a guide once we landed. Although it is much safer to go to Brooks on your own with all of the paths and bridges than it was 23 years ago on my first trip, it is comforting to have someone who knows the way and can direct you as to the right course to take to get the most optimum experience possible. Anyone, even a single female traveler as myself, should comfortable going on this trip. Seeing the bears in their natural habitat is something to behold. Although they weren't feeding at the falls this time, Curtis knew to have us go down river at the other platform to see as many as 6 bears frolicking in the water, chasing down trails, and walking right underneath us where any camera could get breathtaking pictures. I was pleasantly surprised at how outgoing, overtly friendly and helpful the staff were upon our arrival back. Helping you off of the plane, making sure that you had a ride to your next destination, assuring that your needs were met etc. I highly recommend Rust's Flying trip to Brooks Falls!!!","July 2, 2015",Rust's Flying to Brooks Falls to see the Bears!!,1,"Anchorage, Alaska",5
Brooks Falls,"If you love bears, this is the place for you! If you truly want to experience Brooks Falls, stay awhile. A day trip to this remarkable place may not be enough time to appreciate these incredible animals. I have been fortunate to visit Brooks Falls twice during the past 2 years and I am going back this year). At first, I wasn't sure about camping amongst the bears. However, I felt very safe, even though we did have some moments of close encounters! The rangers are wonderful and the bears are focused on the fish! Getting to Brooks is somewhat challenging, but the view from the seaplane was amazing! The best part of staying at the campground is having the opportunity to view the bears at different times throughout the day. We saw so many bears, sometimes there would be 10+ bears at the falls! Also, it is amazing watching the cubs and sub adults! This place has been the highlight of my Alaska vacations! I highly recommend this for people who love to photograph and/or watch bears in their natural habitat!","April 14, 2015",Trip of a lifetime!,8,"Belleville, Illinois",5
Brooks Falls,"This certainly was indeed a trip of a lifetime and one checked off the 'ol bucket list. We went in September, when the crowds were all gone and school was back in session. We didnt want the crowds. We saw many bears because they were all out and about trying to fatten themselves up as much as they could on salmon right before their long winter hibernation.  We stayed at the lodge overnight for one night. If you can do it, and I realize it is very pricey, but try to stay overnight just for one night. We were so glad that we stayed overnight. It just made the whole experience more of an interactive experience that way. There was no rush to get back onto a bus, we had our cozy little cabin which was so cute and rustic, we hung out in the lodge that night by the indoor firepit inside the lodge with all the other guests while we had a cocktail, kicked our feet up by the fire and shared experienes with the other guests (although that was kind of a funny story in itself because there were groups of people there from different parts of the world so there were like four different languages going on (english being one of them) and things were getting lost in translation and it was cracking everyone up as everyone was trying to understand everyone else. We finally ended up talking about Sasquatch or Yetis or something where veryone could chime in and say ""ah yes, one of those has been seen on our country too"". It was so funny and so enjoyable.  The meals are very pricey at the lodge, it is buffet style so you are not offered anything a la carte. No menu or anything like that because getting food to the lodge is a major accomplishment in itself since they are in such a remote location. So there is no way they could do ""menu"" style being so far off the grid like that. So you only have one option, the all you can eat buffet style. The buffet food was good, just pricey. And please do not try to bring any food of your own there to save on costs because no food whatsoever is allowed at Brooks Lodge or on the grounds and also not even allowed in your own personal cabin either. That is because it is for a very good reason. You are in the middle of bear country. Bears like food. Bears smell food. Bears want food. You do not want to put yourself or your spouse or family in any jeopardy by carring any food or snacks at all in your backpack, purse or anywhere in your luggage. Please be respectful to the lodge and to the bears and follow that strict rule. Oh, please set your watches or bring a small alarm clock that is battery operated so that you can set an alarm to be at breakfast (or all meals on time). Your cell phones will NOT have any signals here and will not work. They do have an emergency satelite phone at the lodge if you need to make an urgent call (but they will charge you like $35 or something along those lines because it is only for emergency use). Anyway, make sure you set your watch alarm or small travel alarm clock for meal times. They strictly adhere to all the meal times, and if you happen to miss the time, well. you miss your meal. We learned this the hard way : ( We got up at a decent time, but then chit chatted in our cabin, then slowly packed up our luggage, then snapped a few photos of our cabin before leaving, then walked down the trail to the lodge hungry and ready to eat breakfast. Well, to our surprise, everyone was inside there eating their breakfasts, but the staff had already started putting away all the buffet food because breakfast was over...we had missed the breakfast! : ( We had nothing to eat. They did let us have a cup of coffee. Then we went next door to the gift shop and bought a Snickers candy bar for our ""breakfast"" and they make you eat the candy bar right there in the gift shop prior to exiting the door because you cannot have any food on the property due to the bear population. There is even a sign hanging inside the giftshop by the door that tells you that any food that is purchased inside the giftshop must be consumed inside the giftshop prior to leaving the giftshop. As you can imagine, we did not miss any more meal times after that : ) Please wear your Bear Bells! I am serious. Bears do not in any way like to not hear people coming. The liked to be ""warned"" by your presence and know that you are there. Bears do not like to be surprised. They will leave you alone if they know you are around. Just make sound on the trails. You are not allowed to have Bear Spray or mace or weapons of any kind, so your only defense you have is to ""make noise"" so the bears know you are walking down the trail. Just talk along the way (they will hear you) and wear your bear bells. I carried my bear bells and shook them, but, my husband did not want to do that so he just wore his set of bear bells hanging carabiner style from his beltloop. The bells are only $5 in the giftshop and come with a hanging clip or you can buy them prior to coming to Alaska or back in Anchorage before coming to Brooks. We just bought ours in the giftshop when we were there. Our one night (well, it comes down to two days and one overnight) trip to Brooks Lodge was sooooo WONDERFUL. We just really soaked it all in. Saw so many bears walking in the woods, the bears swimming in the water and fishing for their salmon, the bears walking along the trail by the lake which goes right by the lodge. We saw a mother and two cubs. We saw eagles and one lonely squirrel with no buddies (I guess his buddies were smarter than to hang out in bear country). We got beautiful photos of all the bears and the beautiful lake and mountains and of course the whole lodge area and our cabin. Even the trip on the float plane coming into and out of Brooks Lodge was such a nice, scenic trip! Our night before coming to Brooks, we stayed in Anchorage at The Embassy Suites hotel. It was very reasonable rates, our room was huge, with separate bedroom, living room. little mini kitchenette in there. Really spacious, clean, nice! Lobby was really nice and also had a free nightly 2 hour happy hour with free appetizers (small offerings, but, still a little something free) and two free cocktails per person. We also stayed there the evening before our Anchorage flight left to return back home from our vacation. I would stay there again at that hotel there. Staff was great, rooms clean and spacious, bed comfortable) We had such a wonderful time at Brooks Lodge. We will remember this trip for the rest for our lives!!! After Brooks, we went on to Denali National Park (we opted for the flight tour there instead of the bus tour). We flew up really close to Mt. Denali, and they fly you over the park for arial view, and if and only if the weather is perfect, they land the plane up on a glacier and you get to walk around on the glacier on these cool glacier boots, they resemble higher tech moon boots!) But if the wind, or weather conditions are in any way not favorable to make that second landing up there, they wont take the risk, for your own saftey. You still get an awesome arial view of Denali National Park though either way. I could go on and on and on about Alaska, but, I know that you have already had to read this long review, so I will leave it at that. Highly recommend this trip. Oh, one last thing, since we went in the Fall, it was beautiful colors there in Alaska and on the tundra and low crowds everywhere. Ahhh, such great memories from this wonderful trip and such beautiful photos to remember it by. But, please dont ""see"" Alaska through the eyes of your camera! Please don't rob yourself of the actual experience of it. Soak it all in and just enjoy it. And remember this, sooooo many other people have been to Alaska and all the places you will see in Alaska, so you can always find so many of the beautiful scenery photos right on line on your computer at home. Of course you want some of your own photos, of course, with you in them and your own experiences, but, just don't experience your trip to Alaska behind the eyes of a camera lense. Experience it through your own eyes and soak it all in and just enjoy it. At least that is just my own personal advice. Have a wonderful time there!!!!! : )","March 18, 2015",One for the bucket list for sure!,44,Michigan,5

Brooks Falls,"We did a day trip here from Anchorage via Katmailand. It was a lot of travel (and money!) for only ~5 or so hours of bear viewing but I still have to say it was worth it. We went mid July and it had started to quiet down in terms of how many bears but we saw lots of the same ones. There were anywhere from 0-3 bears at the upper falls and usually 2-4 bears at the lower falls. The upper falls had the more dominant larger bears that stood quite still, occasionally lounging to catch its salmon. The lower falls had the younger and/or smaller bears who were more lively and entertaining to watch! Especially the young bears who would chase after the salmon. However, with the bears often by the bridge at the lower falls, which you must cross to get back to the main area for departure, you must get back early as the bridge is closed when bears are within 50 ft. Really amazing experience.","December 3, 2014",Once in a lifetime bear viewing,38,"Vancouver, Canada",4
Brooks Falls,"Visited katmai np / brooks falls through brooks resort day trip from anchorage. It consists of taking a pen air flight to king salmon, and then a float plane to the park. The float plane was small and cramped, but it is only a one hour flight. I went in early July, not during the peak of the salmon run, but there were 5 bears fishing, including one with a cub sitting on a railing. Try to get an early flight out of anchorage so you can beat the waiting time. There is limited space on the viewing platforms, so they limit you to 40 minutes at a time. If you beat the rest of the visitors there you will not have to wait. I think I had a 6 am flight, and did not have to wait, but I was one of the last lucky ones. There are a couple of other platforms besides the falls, and you can stay on those as long as you like. Plenty of bears to see from those platforms as well during my visit. The park service also offers a cultural tour to see some native dwelling areas including a recreated long house, which was interesting. The one thing I was leery of was that brooks resort's web site said there was no refunds in case flights had to be canceled due to weather. If I had to do it over again, I would probably try camping there, that way there would be plenty of time to watch the bears because the day trip flights all leave by around 5 pm.","December 2, 2014",Amazing,8,"Spokane, Washington",5
Brooks Falls,"You may see the amount of bears others have reported, you may see only half that. Honestly you need to go regardless. I went in July when in previous years it was prime time to view bears. When we arrived, we learned the salmon had peaked a week earlier. Although some of the photographers were a bit disappointed, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It started with a spectacular float plane with Katmailand from King Salmon out to Brooks Camp. Landing not far from the beach was a thrill in itself as we taxied in over incredible blue waters. The Rangers are well-informed and displayed confidence in their knowledge and skills. A food cache and storage area is conveniently located next to the bathroom near the beach.Even though I had spent 6 years working in Denali National Park, I am still respectful and leery of bears. I have never felt so comfortable in bear territory. It's an amazing opportunity to witness bears feeding, and going about their business as if you are only a visitor. If you have your doubts, know that you are not alone, and you will get educated and be in good company with other visitors. Let that not deter you from an opportunity to see these bears.","September 23, 2014",A unique experience!,23,Alaska,5

As soon as our float plane landed we were whisked off to""bear school,"" so we would know how to deal with and avoid confrontations with all the bears. We saw several moms with cubs. The place is run so well, you never feel scared if you do as you're told. We went to Brooks Falls several times in the 4 days we camped at Katmai. We saw amazing ""bear footage"". Once a big grizzly bear bit another bear who had dared to infringe on his spot under the falls. We saw a mother bear nursing her QUADS--yes 4 babies. We were so close to her on the viewing platform, I counted her nipples as she lay on her back to nurse. It was a totally amazing sight.

You have great views of Katchemak Bay, Mt Augustine and other volcanoes, the mountains and glaciers of Katmai NP.We were packed with lunch, water, binoculars, photo material and extra memory cardsAfter arriving at Brooks Camp our pilot advised us to have our lunch during the bear talk of the rangers (so we did not waste any of the precious time) You can also have lunch at the picnic area but then you have less time to watch the bears.Immediately after the briefing we stored our food in a safe room and headed out to the viewing platforms at Brooks Falls. The only food item you are allowed to take with you is water. So no candy, soda's, sandwiches, chewing gum, ...We put our names on the list for the upper platform and then went to the lower platform to spend some time before it was our turn to go to the other platform.When it is your time a ranger comes looking for you here (good system, you don't waste your time, they look at their watch for you)Our time on the upper platform also was awesome. When your turn is over, a ranger comes to call you. We went back to the lower platform.In total we saw 10 bears at the falls and 5 on the beach and path.The weather on the day we went was sunny (we had to use our sunscreen).

Brooks Falls,"We booked the one day tour through Brooks Lodge. Took early-morning commercial flight from Anchorage to King Salmon, then connected with a 20 minute scenic floatplane service to Brooks Lodge. Upon arrival we attended a short mandatory Bear Safety Orientation presented by the rangers, and then we headed out to Brooks Falls. We were a week past peak trout season, but still got plenty of bear activity to observe. We were glad to not be stuck with a tour guide and were free to balance between seeing bears, walking the trails, and relaxing by the lake (with even some pebble skipping time). There was always a ranger at every turn who was friendly and helpful in explaining anything. NOTE: I strongly recommend traveling light and not bringing food or excessive baggage because you will have to lock it up in a bear-proof facility by the entrance. It’s worth traveling light and paying the $26 for the buffet lunch, which although not cheap was good and fulfilling.

Brooks Falls,"I Visited on August 20 2014. The plane flight up gives you an amazing view... the seaplane ride is amazing. It was a beautiful sunny day. Location is amazing. Just have a few issues with the folks running the bookings.Was told over the phone ""it's a bit quieter at this time of year. you won't see as much as you would in a month's time. It'll be better if you could wait a while"". I was only in town for a couple of days.... so after calling back and being told Bears were still being seen in the area.. I went ahead.I realise nature is nature and all that... but I REALLY wish I had asked much more specific follow up questions about the likelihood of seeing bears because......When I arrive the Orientation Ranger says ""we have 57 Bears who live in the area... at the moment we think 3 are in the vicinity."" So basically.... 95 percent of the Bears you are paying a LOT of money to see are not even at the location... so you obviously have no chance of seeing them.They really should be very specific about this on the phone. Next Ranger says ""most of the bears leave the area at this time of the year and are about 6 miles away. They'll be back in September though. You'll be able to log onto the webcam when they are feeding on the salmon... and tell people you've been here...""After paying around 700 dollars to make the day visit ... this is not really of much use to me since I live in Australia.I was also told I could catch a boat to another spot where there ""is more Bear activity""... for another 200 dollars.And to cap it all off... the site was also under construction... and there were huge 10 wheel trucks moving large amounts of earth backwards and forwards all day up and down one of the 3 main trails you are supposed to use to go and try and find the Bears. This was not mentioned at all on the phone either.I am not an expert..... but I am guessing huge loud trucks going up and down the road every 30 minutes doesn't help an already difficult cause of finding Bears in their ""natural"" environment.So in my mind... if you know 54 of the 57 Bears are not even there... and there is very loud construction taking place all day... it's not really that cool to even be open for business charging people a lot of money to do a day trip to specifically go and see the Bears. Tell people they are more than welcome to come and camp at a beautiful location, enjoy the amazing 18 hours of sun and the serenity, fishing, hiking etc... but be very upfront about the fact you have a 5 percent or less chance of seeing a Bear.I am sure it is spectacular when all 57 residents are in the area.

Brooks Falls,A two hour flight out of Anchorage with Regal Air and then 20 minutes on a seaplane gives one an idea of how isolated this place is.Yes the number of bears depends on the amount of fish and the travel companies can't be held responsible for that. So you pay your money and takes your chance. On our trip we spent almost an hour waiting on the trail for two bears to move off so that we could cross the first bridge only to be stopped further up by a couple (of bears!) courting on the path! When we eventually got to the viewing platform the bears were literally only a few feet away and to see they dynamics of how their hierarchy worked was incredible.If we ever manage to save enough to go again we'd stay in the lodge so that we could spend longer here.As a final comment do they really need to allow fishing so close to this location isn't Alaska big enough for them already ?,"August 18, 2014",Not cheap but if you'r lucky it's a lifetime experience,275,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",5

Brooks Falls,This is truly a once in a life time trip to see grizzly bears close up. The float plane over was also an experience and expect a delay at King Salmon if its foggy which it usually is must mornings. The guys can't control the weather so give them a bit of slack and don't moan. The rangers at Katmai will impress on you that is bear country so listen to what they say and stay safe. When walking up to the falls walk with other people as noise usually stops the bears from crossing your path in the woods. We new about the mossie's so came prepared with head nets and lots of deet. Nature can be fickle so how many bears you see from day to day varies but you will be very very unlucky not to see any. They say early July when the salmon are spawning and then early September when the salmon are dying are the prime times to go. The info of how many bears seen each week is available on the Katmai national parks web site. The excitement of seeing a huge 800lb 9 foot grizzly ( the rangers call him Lurch ) close up feeding in the falls can not really be described as its a bit surreal but it will live long in the memory. We were lucky enough to see 5 bears in the falls feeding and from both walkways the lower and upper got some amazing photos. We also saw bears on the beach. Take water and wear layers.

No one we talked to while making reservations and nowhere on the internet mentioned this little detail and why would they? It wouldn't facilitate business! I feel duped.

Brooks Falls,"Are you ""safari"" fanatics? Is viewing polar bears on your to-do list? Or visiting Galapagos on your agenda? Then watching brown bears fishing for salmons at Brooks Falls should be a must item as well.It is totally rewarding, despite the costs.However, to make the most...you should consider staying overnite either at lodge or campground at Brooks Falls. Overniting allows multiple viewing opportunities. There is limits to the ""prime"" viewing point: only 40 people at a time, and only up to 60 minutes at a time. Overniting at Brooks Falls allows you to come to the prime view point before the day-trippers get there (around 1030) and after day-trippers leave (around 1530). Plus, bears tend to be hungry when they get up (early am) and before they rest (late late afternoon). Problem is booking......make sure you do faarrrrrr in advance.Cheap way of taking commercial planes is troublesome. Spend the money and go with charter companies......we did through Rust's, very good service.You can also view bears thru live cams.....great preview and follow up with your favorite bear. But, live cams do not do justice....need to experience it yourself. Live cams at explore.orgAlso, pay attention to timing....when salmon's run most.....more salmons more bears.....we saw momma and spring cub fishing at the mouth of brooks river and on the beach.

The 3 hrs flight out of Anchorage with Regal Air was amazing by itself. We saw mooses, beluga whales, a pattern of mountains, lakes.... seemed to be a different, more beautiful planet. Then came the beare, I mean,we came to them, and the first thing we learned, was that this land was their land, not ours. With a hell of respect we took the 1.2 miles hike to the world famous viewing platform. To the brown giants, standing in the water, ready to have the salmons flying into their mouths. On the way back, we saw a saw with two 3 months old cubs - the cutest thing, made me almost cry. Another ancounter with a BIG brownie made me almost run. But as we had learned, try to stay calm, and running away means prey. Not easy to remain cool, believe me.

Brooks Falls,"I rated our visit a 3 which is the average between 1 and 5. It was really an all or nothing experience. We visited Brooks falls to fulfill my dream of many years to see bears catching salmon from the river. We spent parts of 3 days at Brooks Lodge. During that time we only saw bears catching fish during a very brief window. For the first 2 days that we were there, there were no bears because there were no fish. Trip advisor did not allow me to choose a date of visit before August 2013 but this visit was actually in the middle of July, supposedly the height of the salmon run. A group of photographers from the BBC doing a documentary told us why. The park rangers are very quiet about this fact, none of them wanted to even talk about it. The commercial fishers are allowed to drop their nets at the mouth of the Naknek river for periods of several days followed by periods when their nets must be raised. During the time of dropped nets almost all fish headed into the Naknek river are captured, with only a very few salmon escaping the nets to make their way to the falls. These facts can be confirmed by going the Alaska department of fish and game website:  www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishregulations.commercial Click on ""2013-2016 Bristol Bay Commercial Salmon Fishing Regulations"" The document is 120 pages long but the pertinent sections concerning the Naknek river are: 5ACC06.320 and 5ACC06.360. If you are there during the time of dropped nets, you will see very few bears catching fish, if you see any at all. For much of the time that we were there, there were no bears at the falls or in the river at all. There is a live webcam at Brooks Falls where one can see if there are bears catching fish or not.  explore.org/live-cams/player/brown-bear-salmon-cam-brooks-falls Observing this webcam over a period of days, one can see that either there are fish and bears fishing or there are no fish and consequently, no bears fishing. To get a visual perspective of the journey that the salmon must make, go to the map at the Alaska department of fish and game ""fish resource monitor"". extra.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/FishResourceMonitor/?mode=culvEnlarge the map centering on Dillingham until you see Naknek and King Salmon. Then enlarge the map centering on King Salmon until you see Lake Brooks, Brooks Falls and Brooks Lodge. If you happen to be there when the salmon are jumping the falls, the experience is fantastic. If you happen to be there when the commercial fishers are capturing all of the fish, the trip is a disappointment.  During the same Alaska trip we visited Anan creek on a day trip out of Wrangell. There were so many salmon that there were areas of the river where one could not see the sand on the bottom of the creek because the salmon were so thick. The fish are so plentiful that it is one of the few places in Alaska where black bears and brown bears fish together. Another pleasant surprise was that there were lots of bald eagles at the site.","July 13, 2014",Feast or Famine for bears at Brooks Falls,32,"Holland, Michigan",3

Brooks Falls,"My wife and I visited the falls as part of a 3 day, 2 night trip to Brooks Camp. I'm purposely limiting this review to our experience at Brooks Falls; will use other reviews to share thoughts on the camp, lodge, etc. We both felt this was the highlight of our 12 day Alaska vacation, and that it exceeded our expectations. Truly an incredible experience.Our visit to the falls was during the last three days of June, so we weren't there to witness the 'high point' of the salmon run; which tends to be in mid-July. However, in our opinion this ended up being a perfect time to see the bears. Some things we learned that may help you plan your trip:Salmon run in schools, and come in waves; so you may see tons one day, and hardly any the next. Don't be concerned if few are running, because it means the bears will hang out longer to fill up. Once they've ate enough, then they head back into the forest to rest up.Use your time at the falls to watch and observe the social behavior of the bears. The falls provides a very unique setting to see how the social hierarchy works within the bear society. We saw a dominant boar chasing off multiple younger bears one evening. Really interesting to watch.Make multiple trips to the falls; go at different times of the day to maximize your opportunity to observe the bears. We went in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Basically, you maximize your opportunities by increasing the number of times you visit. Be aware...the platform is closed between 10 PM and 7 AM to allow time for bears to fish the falls who aren't as comfortable around people. Also, the platform at the falls has a 40 person capacity. The rangers closely manage this during July. When the number of people exceeds the capacity, they limit your time on the platform to one hour. They do this by taking your name down, and the time you started on the platform...rotating people in/out when their time is up.As other reviews have stated, there's a 1/2 mile hike through a forested area to get to the falls. Expect that at some point you'll run into some bears on the trail; we did, and met many others who did as well. The park rangers prepare you well with how to act around the bears during the required 'bear etiquette' class you attend when you first arrive. In short, the bears aren't interested in you; they'll simply ignore you.Again, the experience was like none other, and the highlight off our Alaska trip!!","July 5, 2014",One of a Kind Opportunity,29,"New Prague, Minnesota",5
Brooks Falls,"As others have said, this is a special place to go to view the bears. We were concerned about the logistics of the day trip from Anchorage, but it was a fun and enjoyable day. The flight from Anchorage to King Salmon was just over an hour. It wasn't more than about 30 minutes before we then were loaded onto the float plane for the 20 minute flight. We were crossing the bridge at Katmai before 11 am. Loved seeing the bears and the salmon up close. It was late June so not as crowded. The salmon run had started but the bears hadn't yet caught up with that, so not more than 3 bears at a time at the falls. But we also had no time restrictions on the deck at the falls. We stayed at that spot for a couple of hours before moving to other parts of the park. I would expect you would have more bears at the falls at one time in July but likely more people and possible restrictions on the falls deck and more delays at the bridge. Highly recommended no matter when you go.","July 5, 2014",Great experience.,64,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

Brooks Falls,I enjoy photography and we stayed at Brooks for three days in a cabin. It's a great experience to wonder among the bears and see them fishing as well as interfacing with each other and the young. We were there when the water was high so the bears were not at the falls much but they had more bears in the area then they ever had. The facility was nice and they had great food in the lodge. The cabin wasn't anything special and the walls are a little thin as you could hear everything going on next door but we didn't need much as we were only in the cabin to sleep. The lodge was a nice place to hang out and even get a beer but a little price but that was expected considering the location. We met a lot of interesting folks from all over the world and many were camping there. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating and went out of there way to help with any needs. The rangers were also very nice and loved to share their experiences and information about the bears and the area.

Brooks Falls,"This trip is a bit pricey at $600 for the day trip but for me it was well worth it. I flew in a small plane out of Anchorage to a middle of nowhere lake to switch to a float plane for the rest of the trek to Brooks Falls and Katmai National Park. After the plane rides I thought that even if I don't see any bears, the plane rides were worth it themselves. What a view of the mountains and volcanoes and that small plane perspective gives you a real sense of the vastness of the Alaska wilderness you can't get anywhere else. You attend a bear orientation and then you are on your own. You walk down a dirt road and then down a path in the woods to the viewing area. My first time walking down the dirt road I encounter people with semi-panicked looks on their faces walking briskly in the opposite direction saying ""a bear is coming!"". Sure enough, an ENORMOUS male grizzly was lumbering down the road toward me and his lumber is faster than my brisk walk. Scared the heck out of me. Luckily, there was a ranger right there who hustled us off to the side of the road and let the bear pass. The bear paid no attention to us at all. Once he passed, I wasn't so sure if I was going to keep going to the viewing area. But, I mustered up courage and continued on. Sure glad I did! At one point there were 11 bears at or near the falls at once. Down river a little ways in the riffles was a sow grizzly and her triplets right near the other viewing platform. Poor momma! She tried to get her babies to stay put on the edge of the river hidden in the grass while she dashed out into the river to try to catch a salmon. The cubs would stay put for about a minute and then wander out to the river crying for their mom. At one point they all fell into the river and were being washed downstream. Mom had to abandon her fishing and rescue them. Darn kids! While the dominant males in the falls can leisurely sit and wait for the salmon to come to them, she had to juggle keeping her babies safe and try to catch a meal. I never did see her catch one. Surely, we were watching how life really was for the sows and their cubs This is no zoo!.An experience of a lifetime!","April 8, 2014",Highlight of my Alaska trip,34,"Shorewood, MN.",5
Brooks Falls,"This is a very expensive trip. $600 for each. But I would say, this is worth every dollar you spend. It is a life-time experience. I enjoyed every minute I had during the trip. When we tried to head back to our water jet, we had some bear traffic and had to stay there 45 minutes longer till the traffic is clear. But that 45 minutes is like watching real BBC movie. I can still remember all the images vividly almost 1 year after the trips. The scenery during the 1 hr water jet was also breathtaking.","March 26, 2014",Worth the money to go!!!,37,"Basking Ridge, New Jersey",5

Brooks Falls,"The reason most people visit Brooks falls is to see the bears. We went in late August, the up side was that the crowds had all but left and the bugs had (mostly) gone - downside was that in the main the bears had had their fill. There were 1-2 on the falls area itself on the days we were there, looking for that last salmon for winter. Though the bears were in short supply at the Falls, they were in abundance in the lakes area and near the fishing areas. We were able to get within 8-10 feet of the bears, though this was very well managed by the park management. Well worth a visit, maybe earlier in the year, though do take bug protection, head nets and bug killer. Bug nets are not a good look, but boy do those things bite and they're there by the gazillions!","October 18, 2013",Bear Central,15,"Brisbane, Australia",5
Brooks Falls,"Tips on visiting Brooks Falls. The first thing to say is that it is a magical experience to be able to view the bears so closely. While I was there there were between 8-14 bears at the falls. I saw all sorts of behaviour: fighting, mating and of course fishing as well as three bear cubs! It was like being in the middle of a wildlife documentary. Now on to the practicalities of visiting. Because I didn't wish to commit to booking to stay in the lodge 18 months in advance I opted to stay in King Salmon. That worked well. It's only a 20 minute float plane ride to come in daily so you beat the other tourists coming from Anchorage, Homer or Soldotna. Also, I think the accommodation in King Salmon is slightly better, proper bathroom, no bunk beds, TV and wifi - in a word - luxury in comparison to Brooks Lodge - and cheaper I think! However I was lucky in that I didn't get delayed due to poor weather. Next things to bear in mind to make the most of your visit if you are keen to see as much as possible: Get over the bridge asap because that is where bear jams tend to be. It takes about 5 minutes to get to the bridge from the lodge/lake landing area. The 1st viewing platform is just on the far side of the bridge. You then have a 7 minute walk gently uphill along a gravelled road. Eventually you get to a T junction for the path going through the woods. At the junction is the only loo (apart from the lodge). Then you have a 10 minute or so walk along a narrow path through the woods that leads to the walkway that eventually turns into the viewing platform. The walkway is long (it probably takes about 8 minutes to walk from beginning of the platform to the falls bit). As others have described, the walkway splits into two at the ""tree house"". One part goes to the lower viewing platform which tends to be less crowded. And the other to the main falls viewing area which you have to sign up for. When I went we were allowed in for 1 hour segments. As soon as you left you could sign up for another visit. The rangers said they were considering reducing it to half hour slots for next year to give everyone a better chance to see the bears. Whilst I can see the fairness of this I am not sure how well it would work because it takes several minutes to get there and back. And that, added to the setting up time of cameras/tripods or a gap on the balustrade might mean you don't see so much. Other tips. Remember you're not allowed to take any food with you - not even chewing gum! But water is allowed. You need to be back on the right side of the bridge an hour before your flight leaves. That reduces the viewing time somewhat because you need to leave the falls about 1.5 hours before your flight. Space in the floatplane is limited and so your camera bag or handbags will be taken off you (and put in the rear of the plane) although you can have a camera around your neck. I recommend that you do because there are often bears fishing on the lake you land on! Your first visit requires a 20 minute ranger session on bear behaviour etc. You are not required to attend the ranger session on subsequent visits. Be prepared for rain - you can buy strong plastic bags quite cheaply to protect your cameras. Bring mosquito repellant. I had a 300m lens and that worked well and I only struggled to get sharp images in low light of the bears on the far shore. I agonised over when in July to visit and opted for the middle of the month. I read so many confusing reports over when the peak of the salmon run might be I wasn't sure what was best. Someone told me that the fishery downstream releases fish irregularly which may account for the fact some days were better than others. The first day was very crowded on the platform so my time on it was limited. Some fish were jumping but for some reason the bears were not on the top of the fall - they were at the bottom. The 2nd day was quieter so the platform was less crowded (I think people got delayed by poor weather) but there weren't so many fish. The 3rd day was the best, the fish were jumping and I got the dream shot of the bear catching the fish in mid air at the top of the waterfall. But it was wet and so a lot of people were put off from staying out on the platform for long. But don't panic if the fish aren't jumping much. If the bears are too successful at fishing they go off and have a nap! So it's better viewing, although worse for the bears, if they have to work a bit harder to catch the fish.I attach a link to the video I made of my visit so you can see what to expect: http://youtu.be/aBAnV73R3c8 I also went to Hallo Bay with Emerald Air who I highly recommend. If you can, I recommend doing both trips because you see different things. At Hallo Bay, it is a much quieter experience wandering around the meadows and spotting bears in the distance. The scenery is wonderful, snow capped mountains and lush bright green meadows. If you have a guide who knows the bears it is possible to get very close. I got to within 20 feet of a bear and her cub. We sat on a log and watched the cub play in the grass for half an hour. I hope that's helpful","September 8, 2013",Tips on how to enjoy it,371,"London, United Kingdom",5
Brooks Falls,"We took a day trip to this wonderful place. Even though it was an extremely warm day, there was no shortage of bears. There were bears on the beach, bears in the woods, in the streams, and of course at the falls. I was worried about it being crowded since we visited during peak season, but the park manages the stream of bear enthusiast very well. Even when you had to wait for a turn on the Brooks Falls viewing platform, there were plenty of other bears to view and photograph in the same area while you waited.A bonus was that the seaplane flight was so much fun. From start to finish...a GREAT DAY !!I also wanted to mention, yes the bugs are bad, (Many people wore bug head nets) BUT... they don't bite......so they are really just an annoyance. Think of them as a little extra protein, LOL. Besides, you will become so engrossed in the bear action, that after a while, you won't even notice them.","August 29, 2013",Bad place to be a Salmon !!,108,"Windermere, Florida",5
Brooks Falls,"Bear viewing is the first priority of our Alaska trip. After doing some research at TA, I decided to go to Brooks Fall. The main reason is because we don’t have high quality, expensive camera (Mine is a $300 point and shot). If we are too away from the bears, we can’t take good photos. But if we are too close to the bears, I’ll not feel comfortable (I don’t know that actually the bears there are so friendly that they totally ignored us). The viewing platforms at Brooks Fall solved my concern. It makes us close enough to see bears, take photos, and feel safe too. I made a reservation in the beginning of July with Bald Mountain from Homer. When we arrived Homer, we bought a newspaper, then learned that a bear viewing flight crashed at Soldotna airport which is 1.5hrs away from Homer 2 days ago. The news made my husband very nervous. He even wanted to give up the trip. I convinced him that it’s only an accident. Finally, he agreed to go.It’s very nice weather the next day. Small 10-person flight flew very smoothly. Not scary at all. The scene from the sky is so beautiful. When we were close to the beach, we already saw a bear playing on the beach. We got excited immediately. After having lunch in the designed location and ranger’s orientation, we all the way walked to Brooks Fall platform. There are upper platform and lower platform. You need to put your name on the waiting list for the upper platform. But can go on the lower platform immediately. When it’s your turn to the upper platform, the ranger will go to the lower platform to call you. We didn’t know that, so we waited there for our turn. Luckily, we didn’t wait too long. We are so close to the bears on the upper platform. I think bears are really good role model for fishing. They are so patient watching the water and try to catch the salmon. I saw one bear caught 3 salmons within one hour. Isn’t it a fishing expert? After one hour, we moved to lower platform. The bears at the lower platform are smaller, but more active. They were running and chasing which is very interesting. We were very lucky when we were back to the upper platform the second time. There was a bear standing up on the fall. We saw it caught a salmon which jumped out of the water. But I am not a good photographer. I didn’t catch that moment. Since there were too many bears playing around the bridge, the bridge was close on our way back to our flight. So we got one more extra hour to see the bears. We had a very good day that day. My husband said it's a life time experience, and he's lucky he did.","August 27, 2013","Amazing place, you must see!",15,"New York City, New York",5

Brooks Falls,"Visited on a day trip with Katmailand (if interested - search for my comments on Katmailand in one of the forums, with 8/14/2013 post date). The park experience in a word - phenomenal.Forget the webcam. Nothing can convey what you will see there. These colossal creatures, their intricate social interplay, the way they catch salmon, what happens next - turns out it differs depending on their social ladder standing, finally - the mighty struggle salmon itself puts up to climb the falls, the role the birds play in the whole yarn, etc. etc. You really need a 360 view.And all of this - in the last throes of the season, when we visited in the last week of July, and have only seen a grand total of four bears. Even still.One tip: ask a ranger about a bear with a huge scar, and to show you a famous video of how he got it (in 2010, if I am not mistaken).For those coming in for a one day trip - keep in mind that to get to the main platform, and to spend some time there - you will need at least 2.5 hours from the time you land in the park, and I would strongly suggest at least 3. The more - the merrier, of course.On the costs - yes, we all know it is costly. If you cannot afford it - don't. If you can - run, do not walk.","August 14, 2013",No webcam can do it justice.

Brooks Falls,"My husband and I took a day trip to Brooks Falls in the 3rd week of July, 2013. And boy, did we see bears! :) They were everywhere. It was a sunny and beautiful day and our flight from ANC-King Salmon and the float plane ride from King Salmon-Katmai went pretty smooth. (We used Katmailand for our trip). After the mandatory bear etiquette class, we were on our way. We saw two huge grizzlies even before we reached the falls. And at Brooks Falls, there were seven bears feasting on salmon. What an incredible sight! and what an honor to see these beautiful animals up so close. We were also very lucky to see a Momma Bear and her three cubs. The platform gets crowded in July due to the day-trippers and increased number of tourists - so you have to put down your name on a waiting list because only 40 people are allowed at the viewing platform at a time. Also, the time spent at the platform is limited to only 1 hour. But you can also view the bears from another viewing point called the Riffles. There is no wait limit/ time limit for this one. Also, absolutely no food is allowed on the trails. We brought our own food that we quickly ate at the designated food area and stowed the rest of our food in the storage area. Only water is allowed in the trails. A day tour is great if everything works perfectly - weather, flight schedule and bear action. We would have loved to stay in Katmai for a couple of days more but it is very expensive and nights are reserved many months in advance.A trip of a lifetime - and we are still dreaming about the bears!

In all, there were over a dozen bears at the falls the afternoon we were there. It is expensive and hard to get to, but worth it. I really recommend that you make reservations a year in advance to stay at Brooks Lodge. We stayed in King Salmon, and one morning it was fogged in and we could not fly to Brooks Lodge in time for the Valley Tour. The lunch at Brooks Lodge was quite good.","August 1, 2013",Wow!! Huge Bears!,366,"Alamogordo, New Mexico",5
Brooks Falls,"We boarded a plane in Anchorage for King Salmon. It was a clear day and the glaciers we flew over made the trip worth it before we got to Katmai! A quick lecture and video on safety and we were on our way. You want to head right out to the falls. There is a lower viewing platform and upper falls platform. For the upper, there is a limit of 40 people allowed. To create flow (because you get mesmerized and don't want to leave for food or water) there is an hour time limit. This goes by quickly and is enforced. Sometimes you can wait two hours for your turn, so get on the list as soon as you can. We were there with people who had departure times of 3:00 and after eating a lunch, they never got to the falls. Best to plan ahead and eat on the way out to the island. The platforms are remote and you are not allowed to carry anything, even a stick of gum. It is a good hike out with scat along the way. Sing, talk or be loud is the rule through the woods. We were fortunate enough to see a mother and three cubs. There was also a Golden Eagle perched for fishing right above the bears. There is a webcam that you are able to watch from the comforts of your computer. Would not bring young children here.

Brooks Falls,"This experience was one I will never forget. The proximity of these wild bears is simply amazing. We were greeted on the beach by a large bear as soon as our floatplane landed. Keep in mind....this is ""their house"" so the rangers move you out of the way quickly for safety and for the bears right to access. After a short presentation about how to act around these beautiful creatures, your off on the trail. You should always travel in groups and I would never consider bringing a child with me. I learned that bears will eat other bear cubs if they are hungry enough. The Rangers did a great job of keeping everyone safe but they were not obtrusive. You have a lot of freedom to enjoy wildlife and this beautiful setting. It was also good to have the Rangers moving professional photographers who had lots of bags and tripods. I understand they want to capture the perfect photo but some would take a large area on the platform and stay all day if they could, which isn't right for the other folks who have come to visit. I thought the park was run extremely well with limited restrictions which is interesting when you think about the liability. Packing your own lunch is a must. I can't imagine why you would want to waste time at the lodge. The day goes quickly as it is mesmerizing watching the water in the falls while the bear wait patiently for the perfect salmon. At times, they looked like they were in a trance until they snatched up a fish, skinned it and ate it within 2 minutes. Bears lose 40% of their weight during hibernation. They have a lot of food to consume before October so they are very interested in what is available in the river. It's just fascinating to watch their behavior.","July 16, 2013",Not your average bear...,78,"Richmond, Virginia",5
Brooks Falls,"Timing is important to view the bears fishing. There just wasn't a huge run of the salmon while we were there. But we saw plenty of bears patiently waiting at the bottom of the falls for the few fish that did appear. We got to see a few bears tussle for their turf in the falls and that was cool. One bear in particular was very vocal whenever another bear encroached into his space.The park rangers are everywhere and to me they erred on the side of caution a little too much. They, as much as the bears, cause the bear jams at the bridge. My friend and I did meet up with one ambling up the path, but it showed no interest in us at all. We just backed off the path and let it have the right of way and it veered off the path and into the wooded area.Eating lunch at the lodge is a necessity (day tripper) unless you pack your own, which we didn't want to do. It was a buffet style and and I say the rating would be a 1 or lower. It is very pricey, which was kind of expected, but the food was not very good. The chicken was so dry I couldn't choke it down. We both got one glass of iced tea and never saw a member of the wait staff after that. It nourished us after a fashion, but did not appease our senses at all.","July 13, 2013","Lots of bears, not enough fish, too many rangers",30,"Dallas, Texas",4
Brooks Falls,"of course, go to katmai during the right season for bears... but also (and i'm not sure if this is even possible) try to time it so that you go on a day when there are plenty of fish. apparently they open up the fishing to humans on a large scale on certain days (i'm assuming they're using boats with nets in order to clear out so many fish, but I don't know for sure) and after those days there are very few fish for the bears to catch. it's still an amazing experience even when there are so few fish, but I imagine it would be even more interesting to view the bears with higher fish activity.","July 12, 2013",timing :),68,"herndon, va",5
Brooks Falls,"As far as the bears go this is an extremely well run place. At least the bears seem fairly indifferent to our presence. I was stunned to see so many bears engaging in activities from fishing to mating, to napping by the side of the path. I have no idea how they have managed to keep both the bears and the people safe as they are very close. We came to within 3 metres of a large brown bear as we were walking along the path returning from the Falls. We turned a corner and there he was. Although we had been making a lot of noise as directed by the rangers, he must have been day dreaming, as he seemed as surprised as us. Luckily we remembered most of our training from the arrival lecture, DO NOT RUN. After what seemed ages he decided to move from the path and head up the hill. It was then I realised my knees were actually knocking. It was thrilling as these bears are big and even bigger when you see them that close. I had expected rangers to be spread out at intervals along the paths. This was not the case. We only saw them at the view points. The Lodge itself is what you would expect, basic but cosy, with a big central fire. If only the food was better. It was dreadful. Plus, they make a big fuss about guests using the antiseptic gel before proceeding to the buffet. What a joke. I saw the staff touching the salad greens with their hands when they placed it onto the buffet. We had stayed at Kantishna Roadhouse 2 weeks before, which is equally as isolated as this lodge and the food there was great. Good simple food is not an impossibility even with this type of isolation. Be sure to ask for a stand alone cabin we were the last ones to be transported from King Salmon to Brooks and were therefore allocated one of the six conjoined cabins. You can hear a pin drop. They ask you not to flush the loos at night as it wakens all the guests in their thinly walled cabins.Loved the bears.","July 9, 2013",Close Encounters,103,"Sydney, Australia",5
Brooks Falls,We visited Brooks via float plane from Kulik lodge. It was part of our fly out package and we were hoping to see the bears at the famous falls while fly fishing our way up the Brooks river. The fishing was wonderfull but not easy as the water temp is still very cold. A number of nice Rainbows did fall to our sculpin and fry patterns ... Lovely fishing also to be had above the falls section... It's is a well run lodge and lunch was very tasty ...then it was back on the float plane at 4pm and off to Kulik lodge...

Brooks Falls,"We went to Brooks Falls in late July 2012. Make sure you time your visit with when the salmon are running. This is the best time to see the bears. You need to have a short inservice with the park rangers before you head out to the falls. Once you are at the falls you put your name on a wait list to get to the upper platform. There is a lower viewing area where you can see the bears but not as close. You are only allowed only one hour at the viewing platform at the falls. However, once you leave you can put your name on the wait list again.  I wish I could say people where considerate of others at the falls but they are not. There are two levels and people park themselves and their tripods on the lower one and don't leave. The park ranger has no control except to tell people their hour is up and even then they argue or suddenly forget what their name is when called. Kudos to the rangers for at least keeping that fair.

Brooks Falls,"What a fantastic spot! It was everything I had hoped. We took a small plane from Anchorage to get to Brooks Falls. It was about a three hour flight through spectacular scenery. When we arrived we received our bear briefing from the NP folks and ate our complimentary lunch in the electrified lunch enclosure. A bit like being the exhibit in the zoo for bears. One bear did come through the lodge area during lunch and the rangers herded it out.After lunch we headed off, our plane group of five pretty much stayed together. We passed the first platform and got to the second platform without seeing any bears. At the second platform we put our names down to go up to the third platform, the closest to the bear action. We were told we could go out on the second platform while we waited. Walking out onto the platform we spotted our first bears sitting up at the waterfall. We thought this was great and were happily watching bears from this position until our turn came up for the top platform. When we got to the top platform it was absolutely fantastic, we were so close to the bear action. The time was limited at this platform and it went quickly. We saw bears walking just below the platform and fishing in the falls, it was exceptional. It was more crowded than I had expected and there was a bit of a wait to get to the top platform. This wouldn't stop me from recommending this trip in the slightest, just be prepared. If I'd had the time and funds I would have stayed at the lodge and done some viewing before the day trip people arrive.","August 15, 2012",My favourite Alaskian experience,15,,5
Brooks Falls,"After a lot of help from the people on this website, I booked us for 4 nights at Brooks Camp which proved to be an excellent decision. We took the seaplane to the beach which was about 20 minutes flight. All bags and passengers were weighed and sent on planes based on weight. Each passenger was allowed a total of 50 lbs of luggage including everything. Once we arrived and found our bags, we used one of the large carts they had to bring our bags to the campground. The campground was perfectly set up with each tent area being enough distance away from another. There was a food storage cache and a gear storage cache that was used by everyone and everything was safe. The only showers were near the lodge and they cost $7 to use.The main attraction was the brown bears feeding on salmon. This was by far the most amazing spectacle I've seen. There were two large platforms set up from where to see bears. The one near the lodge had less visitors as the bears in that area were swimming and not too great in numbers. The one deep in the woods near the falls had a lot of activity. We saw up to 13 bears there fishing at one time. During the day it can get rather crowded with all the day trippers who come. Nights were the best. It closes at 10 PM to allow for shy bears who don't like people around to have a chance to eat also. You can't discard the first platform near the lodge because there were times when that's the one that had all the activity. You need more than one day in order to make sure you see some action. There were times when we stayed for a couple of hours on the falls platform and saw only one bear. It's a chance.We didn't have food with us because we'd just come from a cruise ship with no time to go to the store. I'd brought some energy bars from home but that got boring fast. Eating at the lodge was expensive $22 lunch, $35 dinner but it makes sense based on how they have to bring the food there. We ate one lunch and one dinner at the lodge. The rest of the time we were on energy bar diet. It all worked out well. But next time we go, we will make sure to have time to get groceries before going to Brooks Camp. There will be a next time for sure!The lodge had an awsome fireplace in the center with chairs around to dry off from the rain or warm up or just relax. You can use the lodge for any amount of time until closing even if you're tent camping. They have outlets you can use to charge your batteries. Every night there was a ranger lecture that was free for everyone to participate. It's highly recommended.","August 10, 2012",Simply amazing!,87,"Central Arizona, Arizona",5

Mid July - my planning was perfect. The chalets need to be booked a long way in advance - they are basic but all that is needed. The lodge was good with nice food and a big fire to sit around in the evenings. We saw up to 15-20 bears and it was wonderful watching them at the falls waiting for the salmon. Saw a mum and her cubs as well. Thanks to All Alaska Tours. You can stay at King Salmon and go down daily to Brooks Falls as well but best to stay as the early mornings and evenings are special times to watch the bears interact with each other.To me, it was a dream come true...For interest sake, the following photos were taken with a small Canon Pwershot A480 with a 3.3x zoom.","August 8, 2012",Fantastic 3 days at Brooks Falls,135,"Gold Coast, Australia",5

We attempted to do some fishing at the lake but were run out by bears. This was ok and we enjoyed watching from viewing platforms. As we walked from the lodge to the falls our guides were alert for bears and once we stopped and stayed very still while a giant bear wandered down our trail. We considered this another once in a lifetime experience and well worth the time to go there.It was about 1 1/2 hour Beaver airplane trip from Alaska Rainbow Lodge.","April 1, 2012",An outstanding place to watch bears in action.,65,"Florence, Oregon",5
Brooks Falls,"Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park was the highlight of our trip to Alaska. It was also the most exciting experience of my lifetime...one aspect I truly hope never occurs again! This is really a double endorsement. To get to Brooks Falls it involves a 3 hour ride in a float plane. Some aircraft are faster than others. Book on the fastest airplane. We chose Rust's Flying Services Airlines which has been around furever! Their pilot was outstanding in that he took us over different topography in each direction. It felt like we could reach out and touch the mountain tops! It's a 12 hour adventure into wilderness.Bears were sunbathing on the beach as our float plane taxied onto the sand. We then had to get to the park ranger's briefing cabin. We did have a plentiful box lunch - then all food was removed from our person. Unfortunately our park ranger who had a captive audience, liked to hear herself talk. This cut into our very expensive bear viewing time. This was actually July 2010. So don't waste any of your precious minutes, especially if you are not over-nighting. If we did it again, I think we'd spend the night sporting insect repellent and hat and facial nets! The tour that allows you to get into the water with the bears would be something to consider for a future trip. Hopefully you'll get past the bears that fish around the lower bridge. Park rangers are there to tell you if it is safe to proceed or not. You are then walking through the same woods that the bears inhabit. I believe it's about a gentle mile uphill. When you enter the secured raised walkway platform area, give your name immediately to the park ranger. Depending on the number of people waiting to access the two-tiered viewing platform, they will allot you perhaps an hour. After that don't miss the lower platform where you can spend as much time as you have left. I feel I got some of my best photography shots from there.  We had been told that often the bears are sleeping in the grass after a salmon feast. What we had not anticipated was the bears not hearing us. Crash boom snap! We whirled around to see what on earth was making so much noise. Two huge brown bears stood towering over us not 8 ft. away! I suggested that we back off the path to give them room to get by, provided they didn't stop for a nibble. Bears are smart. Why tromp through the woods when you have these lovely cleared paths? Well one took the path and the other ran around us. I could have touched his fur as he chose to throttled past us. Hindsight is brilliant. If you are only two people, I strongly urge you to walk with other people and sing very loudly! And yes, I would risk it again. Brooks Falls is the premier location for admiring big beautiful bears! To observe these bears in nature is a lifetime golden memory.","December 15, 2011",The Bear Truth!,78,"Vancouver, Canada",5
Brooks Falls,"Brooks Falls is located in the Katmai National Park in King Salmon, Alaska. This place is simply amazing. If you really want to see brown bears, and fish sockeye salmon then Brooks Camp is your place. The park is open to public between June-September. In order to visit the park you have to coordinate a flight with Katmai Air.Once you get there an 10 mins. orientation talk is mandatory by NPS Park Rangers. Visitors are not allowed to carry food and must be placed in Food Cache.There is camp ground and Lodge has rooms (Previous reservation is required).Brooks Lodge has a dinning area: Breakfast ($12), Lunch ($20) and dinner ($30). Bathrooms and outhouses are available, but limited. From the Lodge area to the Falls is about 1.5 miles (don't bring too much stuff since the space at the falls might be limited)Peak visitation is late June and July. Waiting time to see the bears @ Falls will be limited to 1hrs. per person. Before or after there is no limit.** Keep in mind that if there is bear activity less than 50 yards or less from the bridges that give access to the falls or other areas they will remain closed to public! ** This might causes delays in flight and you might get stuck for a while. If you want to fish, a fishing license is required. (you can buy it @ Brooks Lodge). Bring clothes for different kind of weather, might be rainy or hot . (40-60F during summer).Insect repellent, camel back o Nalgene bottles of water, and comfortable shoes are highly recommended.

Brooks Falls,"My son and I had reserved a plane ride to Katmai National Park for Monday and were told we would be there from 0800-1700, and to arrive at 0730. We got there before 0730 and were told that now our return flight would be at 1300 instead of 1700, but we could have a discount from $188 to $170 (wow). The reason given was something vague about making a flight schedule. As we didn't have any additional time to postpone the trip we took their offer. In a nutshell, the Katmai air staff had very poor people skills. We ended up only having a little over 2 hours to enjoy the whole trip, and felt like we were being rushed in and out of there. I don't know if the other options for planes in and out of Brooks falls are better, but I might try something other than Katmai Air. We didn't get to see the interpretive center nor browse the store. We would have liked to see the auditorium and what was available there, but were rushed out.BUT, seeing the bears on the waterfalls as well as on the trail close up was spectacular and if we had a good flight experience and were able to see all we wanted I would have rated it excellent.","July 28, 2011","Brooks Falls Unique worthwhile experience but Katmai Air, not so much",20,"Newport, OR",4

We watched these incredible creatures for hours and would have loved to have stayed longer. We were shocked to see bears on the beach as our floatplane landed at Brooks. 15 bears all fishing at the falls at one time - simply incredible! We were even lucky enough to see a mama bear and her 4 spring cubs, completely adorable!!! It's very expensive to get to this bear haven, but I wouldn't miss it if at all possible. Consider staying for one night for sure so you have time for a lot of viewing.

Brooks Falls,"Just adding to the other glowing reviews. We visited the park early September. We expected to see lots of bears up close, but we could not get enough of them.In September you avoid the July crowds and several hours of wait to access the platform. Still plenty bears to get you entertained.The downside is the accommodation: either a$800 per night cabin -no way- or a campground with unpredictable weather. Choose your poison. What is nice is that campers can use the lodge to warm up around the fire, eat a proper meal -prices were reasonable- or take a shower. But still camping in the rain was not fun. Be prepared. Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend spend at least one night there, because the alternative is wasting the whole day flying.Talking about flying, the service of Katmai Air was impeccable. They put us in an earlier flight coming in. And the flight out was delayed but they made sure we made our connection.","September 14, 2010",Unforgettable,99,Boise,5

I wondered how we could spend a whole day watching bears......I was nicely surprised.Although there weren't any at the actual falls,we watched about 9 bears at the mouth of the river all day.Swimming,fishing,playing,sleeping.Brilliant.I would recommend dressing in layers,gloves too.Get across the bridge as soon as you can as the platform is the best place to watch them as if you get bear jams the bridge can be closed for hours at a time.They work on the basis that bears have to have a minimum of 50 yards away so if they're in the river by the bridge they stop you crossing.Allow plenty of time to get back across too although they did send a boat to get someone whose flight was leaving and he was stuck on the platform because of the closed bridge.A great day.Highly recommend it.","September 7, 2010",Amazing,52,"London, United Kingdom",5
Brooks Falls,"We went to Brooks Falls July 25 & 26. I was afraid that would be too late for the bears but we hit it at the peak! We saw 8 before we had even gotten off the float plane. This place is absolutely incredible. There is no way to describe the feeling of seeing these giant predators doing what they do. The sights sounds of their fights over the choice fishing spots were intense and to see them catching salmon, stealing salmon, eating salmon was something that is beyond imagination. The walk through the woods from the Lodge to the falls could be a little exciting since the bears like to use the path too. We were surprised a couple of times, but the close encounters are kept to a minimum by a very alert bunch of rangers. The bears have the run of the place and that's how it should be. Our plane's departure was delayed because a Mom and her four little ones decided to hang on the beach next to the plane for a while. We couldn't leave till she did.

The park rangers do a good job keeping bears and visitors apart in many places but the 1 mile trail from the lakeshore to brooks falls is unguided and it was common to see bears in the woods on either side of the trail. 2 bears once ""chased"" us off the trail as they were running up-trail as we were hiking down-trail. Not to worry, the bears are very well fed on salmon and don't pay much attention to people. The viewing platforms at the falls are crowded but the sight of 15-20 bears in one spot all feeding or playing together is spectacular.","January 10, 2008","Bears, too many to count",18,Indy,5
Brooks Falls,Viewing the bears was one of the biggest highlights in my life...incredible to live amongst the bears and observe them in their natural habitat.,"November 3, 2006",Fabulous experience,12,California,5
Brooks Falls,"We cannot thank our travel agents Heidi & Melinda at All Alaska Tours, Pen Air, Katmai Air, the Rangers and the folks at Brooks Lodge for giving us a wonderful once in a life time experience. The Bears were every where, starting as we were landing (you can see the bears lying on the beach) and ending when they kept us captive for an hour before we were able to board our plane. We watched them fishing for Salmon, swimming, running after each and just lying around the beach. You really haven't seen Alaska if you don't go to Katmai Park & Brooks Falls.

Brooks Falls,"Just returned from a trip to Alaska. It's hard to say what was the highlight, but Brooks Falls is definitely in the running. There were a total of 10 Brown bears feasting on the Salmon. It was incredible! We were there in the late afternoon on 7/21/01. Since it was the late afternoon, there wasn't a crowd. We stood there for over an hour in awe as we watched them fish, eat, a little fighting and a little pooping too. When they pooped, it was funny how they turned their backsides to us. I took pictures that rival the postcards. Our pilot told us that the last time he was there, there were no bears. I guess we were very fortunate.Walking back to the plane, we had to wait for a big brown bear as he crossed the path and went swimming.","July 30, 2001","Bears, Bears, Bears",0,,5
