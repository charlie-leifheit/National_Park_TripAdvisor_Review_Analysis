Acadia National Park,"Take your time in the area and allow at least 2 or 3 days to explore the various parts of the park, more if you are into hiking the numerous trails within the park. There are too many highlights to mention. Pick up a map at the entrance and try to do a loop around the park, but be sure to check times for best viewing at Thunder Hole. Definitely going back.","October 18, 2019",Natural Beauty,52,"Long Island, New York",5
Acadia National Park,"Acadia National Park is a true gem. Here you can experience the power of the ocean (Sand Beach, Thunder Hole), the majesty of mountains (Cadillac Mountain), and the serenity of the Jordan Pond. There is also the stillness of the forests, set ablaze on our October trip by the color change of the leaves in autumn revealing many more shades of yellow, orange, red and even brown than I previously knew. You can go by bike, go by hike, go by car or go by bus, but the key is GO! Go experience this breathtaking display of beautiful nature. You will be so glad you did.

Acadia National Park,We spent day here and would have liked longer. It is well worth the $30 entrance fee. We drove up Mount Cadillac where the views were breathtaking. The Fall colours in the park were wonderful and there are plenty of parking/pull in areas so one can stop to admire the scenery and take photos. We were especially thrilled to see a family of white tailed deer.,"October 18, 2019",Brilliant!,121,"Reading, United Kingdom",5
Acadia National Park,We took an excursion that went through the park. We were able to get out a few times to see the vistas and enjoy the beautiful fall foliage. I would recommend a tour through the pro as we learned so much about the history of the park and facts about the great fire and the bridges. Really a nice day. I would love to go back and enjoy the trails. ,"October 18, 2019",Beautiful park,61,"Montvale, New Jersey",5
Acadia National Park,"We visited the Bar Harbor area and Acadia National Park recently. I have never been to New England and did not know what to expect. We truly enjoyed the beauty of Acadia National Park. We only spent two days in the park but enjoyed gorgeous hikes with stunning views of the Atlantic and the amazing display of colorful leaves in the Autums. Sand Beach was beautiful with its blue water. It’s an inlet and we hiked along the cliff trails surrounding the beach to outstanding views below of Sand Beach and the ocean. We drove to Cadillac Mountain where the wind was super gusty that day. There is a short hiking path there with panoramic views of the Atlantic. Also there is a small gift shop and bathrooms at the top if Cadillac Mountain. We visited Thunder Hole, but the waves coming in 2 hours before high tide did not make the loud clap of thunder sound that day. However, we were not disappointed because the waves splashing over rocks and just walking around the area made for a nice time. There’s a gift shop there, as well. While near Thunder Hole, we hiked to Cadillac Cliffs. This is a beautiful hike over rocks, under rock overhangs, and through the woods. We also hiked to one of the Bubble Rocks which was uphill and the forest was vivid with color. We drove to Jordan Pond, did a two hour, relatively flat hike around the pond. The hike had breathtaking views of the pond, more like a small lake, colorful leaves and a forested area. At Jordan pond, there’s a very nice gift shop and a restaurant. Acadia was beyond beautiful in October. In Bar Harbor, the town was a beautiful sea coast older town with great Inns, shops and restaurants. There was so much to do in Bar Harbor. You can take a few hours sea excursion, as well. My only regret is that the time we spent driving up highway1 and in Bar Harbor and Acadia was way too short. The National Parks our west are massive and jaw dropping, but Acadia certainly held its own with its own kind of beauty. I highly recommend a fall trip around the first or second week of October to this gorgeous area. ","October 18, 2019",Stunning ,37,"Estes Park, Colorado",5
Acadia National Park,This is such an amazing park to see! So many beautiful pull offs to enjoy the scenery and soak in the views. We had a rental car so we were able to take our time and enjoy it at our own leisure.

Acadia National Park,"We took a small group tour through the park mid week in October. The crowds were great as everyone was there to see the fall colors. The colors in the park were stunning and it was nice to hear the history of the park from a guide. It was our first visit, so the tour was a great way to get acquainted with the park and its history.","October 17, 2019",Beautiful Park!,571,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5
Acadia National Park,"We stayed at the Atlantic Eyrie which is about a mile outside of Bar Harbor which I was glad of when I saw how busy Bar Harbor and the park were. The visitor center has a huge parking lot and it was almost full - despite the availability of shuttles. Given this the park staff have done an excellent job in making sure everyone has a quality experience. They have parking areas at strategic spots and allow parking on the side of the road near the interest areas - brilliant planning I say. What you do is drive down a mostly one way road and pull over and park at places that seem interesting or beautiful. The highlight is the top of Mount Cadillac which affords an incredible view of the the hillside and the bay. Winding up to the top there are also great views and at the top there is a large parking lot that circulates cars as people come and go and it seemed to accommodate all the visitors. There is a short circular walk you can take to see the view from all the sides. We also stopped at Sand Beach - very popular - and later drove to Eagle lake and hiked around it. You walk on a wide old carriage road until you get to the far end where you have a choice to walk on a trail instead, there is a stretch where you have to rock hop. Leaving the Island we stopped off at Ship Harbor enjoyed the nice walk with views of the estuary and the wild ocean. So. Its incredible and don't stress out because of the crowd because it will all work out.","October 17, 2019",Beautiful and Accessible,97,"Santa Cruz, California",5

Acadia National Park,"We only had one day to visit Acadia this trip...but we’ll spend more time next visit. However, if you only have one day...get up early (5:00am) and drive to Cadillac Mountain for the sunrise. We arrived there at 5:30, and had a great parking space. You can see it from your car if you get a good space, but if you can, walk right out to the rocks to get a spectacular view. It’s a close walk...not hard or far. Even though it was a little cloudy, it was gorgeous!! Then, take a drive around Park Loop Road. Make sure you stop at Schooner Point and MAKE SURE to walk down the path there to the water. It’s absolutely amazing down there. Worth the walk and not too far down there. Also see Thunder Hole...it’s worth the stop. Both are right on the side of Park Loop Road. We made it around the Park Loop Road and saw these amazing sites and magnificent views in about 3 hours. But you can spend a few days there taking in the trails and Mt. Desert Island nearby. We were perfectly happy with our 3 hours though. Worth the stop even if you only have 3 hours. ","October 16, 2019",A MUST DO!!,2,"Pisgah Forest, North Carolina",5

We are in our 50s and hiked both the Bubble Rock and Beehive, both of which take skill and strength. If you want something less risky, the Ocean Path along the coast, and Thunder Hole are both excellent, easy walks. Parking is really a problem throughout the park during peak season, but you can find a spot with patience and good parallel parking skills. It is a trip of a lifetime, and we highly recommend it during the first or second week of October.","October 15, 2019","Excellent Views, both Driving and Hiking",15,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

That it is gorgeous and a stunning national treasure has been said before, but the park service has to get a handle on the number of people in the park. I can't remember a time I've been there before that I saw as many people there as I did this time. Popular spots, like Sand Beach or Jordan Pond, are starting to resemble an LA theme park for the sheer number of tourists walking around with expensive cameras. Something has to be done. It was overwhelming and it will probably be a while before I go back.","October 14, 2019",Beautiful but...,12,"South Portland, Maine",4

Acadia National Park,"We bought a cruise ship excursion to see sights in the park like Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond, and Cadillac Mountain to ensure we would get a tour of this park. The tour has a couple of short stops for Thunder Hole and Jordan Park and a longer stop at the top of Cadillac Mountain. Thunder Hole is only impressive when the tide is coming in; otherwise there is no spray coming up out of the blow hole. Jordan Pond has a nice restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. Its popovers (2 for $8), a take on Yorkshire pudding, were popular and were served with jam. Its gift shop was stacked with jars of jams and bags of popover mix. Outside there was a path around the pond which gave us an opportunity to see what one of the carriage roads looked like. These gravel roads are mainly used by the horse and carriage ride businesses. As the bus climbs up Cadillac Mountain, there are many opportunities to see vistas of the Bay, small lakes, and forest trees - without human development or industry. In mid-September, the deciduous trees had just a hint of Fall coloring. The peak of Cadillac Mountain offers some rocky trails to walk along besides just standing at a rail to take pictures. We enjoyed our 27 mile tour of the island. On our way back to town, the bus driver drove past some of the summer homes built by wealthy families that weren't burned in the island fire a while back and through the town.","October 12, 2019",Did the 2 1/2 hour bus tour from the town to Cadillac Mountain and back,1252,"Vancouver, Canada",5

Acadia National Park,"Our kids are 5 and 7 and they made it through both these hikes and the Gorham Mountain trail in two days and had a blast. The mountain trail is quite taxing, but the view at the top is worth it. It is short and coming down is really fast so you can keep walking along the coast after that. Also, there are no restrooms at the Gorham Mtn trailhead, so plan accordingly. Stop by Thunder Hole and hear the awesome sound. This is a tourist bus stop so it is very busy. If you want to park there get there at 8am. There is a gift shop and restroom. Get your parking pass the day before you go if you can—it will be good for 7 days and is required for parking anywhere in the Park.

Acadia National Park,"We probably spent 1.5 days in the park (in the course of 3 days), hitting the highlights such as Thunder Hole and Schoodic Point. Our best experience by far was sunrise on Cadillac Mountain. As there are only 145 parking spaces, we were warned to arrive no later than 5:30 for a 6:30 event. As we were extra paranoid, we arrived at 4:40 and we weren't the first. Although it had rained the night before, the sky was absolutely clear and the magnificent Milky Way blazed overhead. I've never seen anything like it. The sunrise over the Atlantic was equally stunning. BE WARNED: the mountain is cold. When we left the house, it was 60 degrees. The mountain (at a bit over 1500 feet) had temperatures in the mid 30s and it was windy. We wrapped up in emergency car blankets.

Acadia National Park,"We visited Acadia National Park over Labor Day weekend. We chose to drive ourselves rather than take the shuttle bus service. It was easier for our family of 5. We started each day bright and early. We found parking spots easily until about 10-11 am. The crowds really built up then. Get up to Cadillac Mountain early or late. By 11 am the line of cars to get a parking spot was very long. They even had to close the road up the mountain. Other popular spots like Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and Jordan Pond were similar. Even on the other side of the island, the popular trails had full parking lots. We packed a lunch and took our chances. We got to see and do everything we wanted to.

She knew all the kinds of trees, plants and animals in and around the park and told us fascinating stories. We took the loop route and ended up at the highest point of the park. It was a clear day and you could literally see forever!!! For those who come by car, there are many excellent walking and cycling routes to take to get to see the park at a closer range. Since we didn't have that much time, a 2 1/2 hour bus tour was an excellent way to get a taste of the park. I would love to go back for a longer period and actually walk some of the trails.

Acadia National Park,"My mom just had knee surgery so we couldn't go on any hikes or where there were long walks. The visitor center with souvenir shop had 52 steps to get up to it so she couldn't do it. It was easy to drive to Cadillac Mountain, though busy waiting for parking when you get closer to the top, we were able to find parking. Dog friendly in this area, spectacular views and she was able to walk around. You pay $30 per car for a 7-day pass which is good because there is so much to see. I was there for work so we couldn't visit everyday and due to Mom's knee surgery and my dog we couldn't visit all the hot spots such as Sand Beach which looked beautiful from above. There are many pull off spots to take panoramic views. The other spot we were able to see was Thunder Hole which was also busy but enough parking. There is a small souvenir shop at Thunder Hole which is open until 4:30. Did not get to go to Jordon Pond House due t location and dogs not permitted in that area. Probably best to split up the visits to the park between the 7-days because of all the spectacular spots and lots of stopping to take photos.

Acadia National Park,"The National Park is a mecca for walking, hikes and scrambling, I had very enjoyable 7 days there walking. You have to be careful about the hikes in the preceding days to any rain storm, the granite is very slippy. That said there are miles of well drained and maintained carriage roads which you can enjoy. The paths are well signed - with cairns and paint. There are some more adventurous routes for those comfortable with height. My single advice is always go up - east to west and down - north to south.","October 9, 2019",7 days of walking heaven,9,"London, United Kingdom",5

Acadia National Park,"We stopped at the Souer des Mont location and decided to go on a short hike. The mistake made was not obtaining a trail map at the visitor center and relying on the free map available. While the maps along the trail purport to indicate the degree of difficulty (Easy, Intermediate and Difficult) they are not well delineated. We thought we were on an Intermdiate trail but would up climbing Mt Cadillac along the Canon Brooke trail-the trail is rigorous and not for those not in some modicum of shape-literally climbing steep rock inclines with disaster at hand should one stumble. The trail itself was elusive at times with occasional blue stripes in the rock showing you that you were on the right path-which we were not. We would up on the opposite side of the mountain from where our car was parked after a 4 hour ""adventure"" only to find we were along the Bubble Pond trail. Thank god that they have free shuttles in the part (I suspect our experience was not out of the norm). I can tell you the vista from the top of the trail was spectacular and there was a bit of pride in knowing 2 people in their mid 60's did this successfully-but the beer and wine that night flowed freely in celebration-though the next 2 days we could hardly walk.There is a lesser known part of Acadia NP to the north of Ellsworth off of Hwy 1 which I would recommend for watching the waves crashing against the shoreline with far fewer people.

They told us that Thunder Hole was open, but to stay behind any barricades. The timing was perfect! The sea was still churning from Dorian and the tide was coming in. It was beautiful and very loud. They told us that Cadillac Mountain would probably be open in the morning, but no guarantees on whether there would be fog.

There are many overlooks of the bay and opportunities to walk out on the rocks overlooking it and to hike. The visitor center doesn't have much besides a gift shop, some rangers to ask questions of, and a place to pay the entry fee that you display on the rearview mirror of your car. We chose to do the Precipice hike, a very streuous andsoemwhat dangerous hike to the top of Champlain Mountain. It took us four hours to do the loop. There is a lot of scrambling over boulders and pulling yourself up ladders - basically iron hand and foot holds in the granite rock. There are some fairly hairy places where you hold on while placing your feet on other footholds with a sheer cliff below it. It's not for the faint of heart.

We made it to Cadillac Mountain sunset- best view from Blue Hill though- get there 1hour early for parking. Dress warmly!Thursday- Breakfast at Great Maine for oatmeal walnut pancakes & blueberry preserves, tofu scramble- highly recommend. We hiked BeeHive- our favorite trail. It’s a little scary if you have fear of heights but doable with views worth it. jordan Pond for popovers - 20 minute wait for inside(35 outside). We saw the Bubbles, but fog overtook them by the time we finished eating. They had vegan options- panini & quinoa salad. We were there for Star week so went into town to hear talk at library which was enlightening & free.Friday- went biking in Carriage Roads. My husband, though very healthy, had quadruple heart bypass 3 months ago so we weren’t sure about this. It’s a great time. We rode most of the day, saw bridges & beautiful ponds auto free. Get helmets! We came upon a bad head injury bike accident! We used Acadia bike rental. Explorer for park has a bike van to take bikes to park from town. We rode back to town via Duck Brook rd.

Our favorite spot was Cadilac Mountain where you get a great view of the ocean. There are a number of spots that you can stop and view the ocean. There is a certain amount of walking up a steep path or down a number of steps. We saw plenty of seniors and they were able to handle them. They had a bus that would take you through the park and a lot of them were using that. We packed our lunch because we not sure how hard it would be to find food. There isn't a lot of places to grab food inside the park, so we were glad we had our own. It cost $25.00 for a 7 day pass to enter the park.

Acadia National Park,"Beautiful National Park with all levels of hiking trails, fantastic ocean views, and easy access. We visited in mid-September. The carriage trails are easy bike and walking trails with a gravel surface. Some of the ""moderate to easy"" hiking trails require more rock scrambling than most 65 year-olds would like and then there are some serious rock climbing areas where we were content to just watch from afar. Be sure the trails are appropriate for your level of activity before you set out. The Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, Jordon Pond, and Cadillac Mountain areas are not to be missed. Although parking is limited in some spots, we arrived at 9:15-9:30 on Cadillac Mountain and had no trouble finding parking. Jordon Pond has difficult parking at noon, because the Park's dinning is there; but it was fine by 1:30. A park road forms a loop through much of the park and a high percentage of the park highlights are very accessible from the road. There are several entrances to the park from state highways.

Acadia National Park,"It has been three weeks since we did our road trip to Acadia National Park in Maine. Prior to the trip, I had committed to myself to document this trip and to write a review on TripAdvisor, as I had been benefiting from the reviews on TripAdvisor all these years, so it’s time for me to contribute my fair share. Let’s get started.We are a family of four: my husband and I in our 50’s and our sons 19 and 14; and we live in western Nassau County on Long Island. The trip was for eight days seven nights from 8/25/19 to 9/1/19. We had initially wanted to make an overnight stop both on our way there and on our return trip. We did stop for one night in Portland, Maine, going there. However, we couldn’t find any hotel affordable on our way back, which was the Labor Day weekend, so we drove straight home. Otherwise, we would like to stop at Kennebunkport in Maine or Providence in Rhode Island.Day 1: We left at 5:15 AM and followed the Waze directions. Traffic was smooth and we arrived in Old Port District in Portland around 9:45 AM (don’t ask how fast we were driving). Our first stop was The Holy Donut. The wait was about 35 minutes, and we picked up six donuts (bacon cheddar, holy cannoli triple berry, sweet potato ginger glazed, Maine blueberry, dark chocolate sea salt and honey lavender), with coffee. We had a couple of the donuts there and saved some for dessert later. The bacon cheddar (savory) and dark chocolate sea salt were our favorite. We then walked around Old Port District, which has plenty of shops, and had lunch at Portland Lobster Company, where we ordered lobster roll ($18 with fries), clam chowder, fried clams and steamers. The food was overall good. Next we headed to Portland Head Lighthouse in Fort Williams Park. It is a large, beautiful waterfront park with big picnic areas equipped with barbeque grills. There was a family grilling lobsters. What a great idea! We then went to Allagash Brewery but couldn’t make their tours, which require advance booking. Anyway, we did the flight (four 3-oz. beer at $2-$3 each). We then decided to have an early dinner before checking in our hotel and arrived at Duckfat around 4:45 PM. There was still a 45-minute wait. We had charcuterie board with four items (chicken pate, ham, smoked salmon and smoked duck), poutine (fried in duck fat), duck confit panini, pull pork panini and brisket panini. Duck is definitely their specialty and the poutine was sinfully delicious and worthy of every calorie. We finally checked in Holiday Inn by the Bay after dinner.Day 2: We checked out the hotel at 10 AM and headed to the L.L. Bean flagship store 25 minutes away. We found the merchandises at the flagship store very expensive, so we went to their outlet store across the street. The outlet strip has many other stores such as Under Armor, Nike, Brooks Brothers, Gap, Banana Republic, etc. After we left the outlet strip, we continued our way up north for about 40 minutes and stopped at Red’s Eats for lunch. It was around 1 PM when we arrived. The line didn’t look too bad, but boy, their service was extremely slow and we waited almost two hours. During the wait, the staff passed out umbrellas, water and watermelon. We ordered lobster roll ($24), fried clams, fried scallops and fried shrimps. Note that it’s a cash-only place. The lobster roll was both excellent in quality and quantity and the lobster meat was plump, tender and sweet. But surprisingly good were the scallops, which we wished we had ordered more. As we continued our trip, we made a side stop at Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield, approximately 75 minutes after Red’s Eats, to visit the school my husband went to over 30 year ago. From there we drove to Bar Harbor another 90 minutes north. Acadia National Park is located on Mount Desert Island and we stayed in Bar Harbor, which town has the most tourists on the Island. Note that cellular reception is spotty on the Island. So make sure you sort of know your directions or have a satellite type GPS handy. We stopped in downtown before checking in our hotel and had dinner at Blaze. There was a 40-minute wait and we had mussels, pork belly lollipops, tacos and pizzas. The pork belly lollipops were succulent and delicious. The mussels and pizzas were also good, but the tacos were a little disappointing.Day 3: Acadia Inn offers free continental breakfast, so we had breakfast at the hotel every day before heading out. We first headed to Hulls Cove Visitor Center. Every car and every person needs to pay to access Acadia National Park ($30 per car or $15 per person for seven days). The pass allows you to park in the Park and use the Island Explorer buses that essentially stop at all the points of interest on the Island. We did not use the buses but I could definitely see the convenience of using them during the peak season, which had just ended the week before we were there. Nonetheless, there were still a lot of cars and tourists, and parking is probably a nightmare during the peak season. Also the buses can be useful for people who do one-way hikes. At the Visitor Center, you can ask the park rangers questions and pick up a free map, which our hotel also offered. There are additional hiking maps for sale for a few dollars. There are many trails in the Park at various difficulty levels, so be aware of what you are getting on. You can also research online. We are not experienced hikers and we were not well equipped, so we stayed away from any hiking trails that mentioned iron rungs. The Park offers ranger-led tours, some with a cost. I would have taken the birdwatching tour but it was not available the week we were there. I suppose the season for birdwatching had ended. So after the Visitor Center, we got on Park Loop Road, which goes around the Park, to get a flavor of the Park. Note that part of Park Loop Road is one way, so in order to do the full loop, you need to turn left at the sign that says one way only to Sand Beach, which comes up a little after the Cadillac Mountain entrance. Our plan was to make a few stops and some short hiking along Park Loop Road. We first stopped at Sieur de Monts, which has a garden, a nature center and a couple of short, easy trails. We did the ½ mile Jesup Path there. We then made a few stops, including Schooner Head Overlook (5-minute walk down); Sand Beach (equipped with bathroom and changing room); Thunder Hole (20 steps down the rocks); and Otter Point (not as pretty as Thunder Hole). There are many pullovers in between. We then stopped at Jordon Pond House to try their famous popovers. We would have just ordered a few popovers for takeout and had them at a picnic table or bench. But they do not allow popovers for takeout. So after a 20-minute wait, we ordered some popovers, smoked salmon and cheese plate appetizers. Their popovers did live up to the hype, but the rest was mediocre. We then walked the 3.2-mile Jordan Pond Path that goes around the Pond. The entrance is right next to the restaurant. The park ranger had said it was an easy trail. Well, we started the Path to the right (counterclockwise). It was flat and easy in the beginning, but approximately two-thirds in, the Path became all rocks and wood planks. The sign at the entrance of the Path says 2 1/2 hours; but we finished in 90 minutes. Though it was not easy, it’s totally doable. We then left the Park and headed to The Travelin’ Lobster for dinner. It’s a shack with outdoor seating. There was a 10-minute wait and we had clam chowder, lobster bisque, lobsters, mussels, lobster grilled cheese panini. All were good.Day 4: The boys had booked a kayak tour for the afternoon at Marine State Sea Kayak, which is located in Southwest Harbor of the Island, approximately 20 minutes away from our hotel. So we decided to explore Southwest Harbor a little in the morning. We first headed to Charlotte Rhoades Park and Butterfly Garden. It is a very small, but beautiful garden with a couple of waterfront picnic tables. It is free, although they suggest donations. We spent 30 minutes there. Then we went to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse about 10 minutes away, which is a working lighthouse with someone living there. The parking lot is very small, but there is not much to see other than the Lighthouse, so people typically come and go. We spent approximately 15 minutes there. Next we went to Thurston’s Lobster Pound 10 minutes away. They have a covered dining area. There were a lot of mosquitoes the day we went, no wonder bug spray was provided at the entrance to the dining area. We only tried their lobster rolls, which were also good. We then went to Main Street in Southwest Harbor about 15 minutes away and walked around the few blocks. There are not many stores, but we liked Sawyer’s Market, a local grocery store. We bought some wines, organic strawberries and a huge blueberry muffin (yum!) from there. Then was the time to check in the boys at Marine State Sea Kayak. Since there was not much else to do in Southwest Harbor, my husband and I headed back to the Bar Harbor downtown. There we did the Shore Path, which is a waterfront path, one mile one-way. Use Google map to Bar Harbor Town Pier and start the Path there. The Path is parallel to Main Street, so when you finish the Path, you can walk a couple of blocks down to Main Street, and walk back to your starting point from there. There are plenty of shops on or near Main Street. We had ice cream at Mount Desert Island Ice Cream and tried strawberry, lemon poppy berry swirl and cafe breve flavors. After a few hours of shopping, we went back to Marine State Sea Kayak to pick up the boys, who said they had a great time and saw seals, porpoises, bald eagles and other birds. For dinner, we were looking for Italian, not just pizza. There’s definitely a shortage of Italian restaurants in Bar Harbor. We ended up at Mama DiMatteos in downtown and had pizza and pasta, which were all quite good. Also the restaurant has its own parking lot, which is a gem for downtown.Day 5: It was a rainy day, the only one during our stay there. It’s a challenge to find things to do since there are not much indoor activities on the Island. We had planned to go to the Northeast Harbor Farmers Market, which is on Thursdays only and about 20 minutes away. There is another Farmers Market in Bar Harbor on Sundays, but we were not there on either Sunday before or after. We went anyway and were disappointed to see only a few vendors open. After a little research, we decided to go back to the towns before the bridge to Mount Desert Island, since there are more big name retail stores to spend a rainy day in. One of the beauties with Mount Desert Island is there are no chain or franchise stores on the Island. Anyway, we found a place called Big Chicken Barn Books & Antiques in Ellsworth, which is the town before Trenton, which is before the bridge. It took us approximately 45 minutes to get there. Big Chicken Barn Books & Antiques, as it is called, is a big barn that sells old books and stuffs. I’m not sure if they are antiques but they are old. After that, we were going to go to a TJ Maxx just to stay indoor, but we saw a Renys, which is a local discount store, so we shopped there instead. There is a L.L. Bean outlet across from Renys. On our way back, right before the bridge, we stopped at Trenton Bridge Lobster Pound and tried their lobster, lobster rolls and clam chowder. The food was just as good as other places. We were then back on the Island and headed to Atlantic Brewing Company on Knox Road. We arrived there 10 minutes before their next tour and were fortunate enough to get a spot. Their tours are free on a first-come first-serve basis. The tour was informative and fun and they were very generous with their beer tasting (soda for the kids). They also run a barbeque restaurant next door, Mainely-Meat Bar-B-Que, where we had their Max Plate samplers, which was a lot of food for a good price. So this rainy day turned out not bad for us.Day 6: We wanted to do some hiking for our final two days and decided on two longer trails: the Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road and the Eagle Lake Carriage Road. These are carriage roads and are flat and wide, suitable for bikes and dogs. In the hindsight, it’d be more fun for the boys to bike on these carriage roads instead, as they found them boring. There is a small parking lot with a sign “Eagle Lake Carriage Road” on Route 233, which is approximately ¾ mile east of Google map “Carriage Road” destination. From this parking lot, you walk a one-mile path and choose the Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road on one side and the Eagle Lake Carriage Road on the other. We did the 5.5-mile Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road, saving the Eagle Lake Carriage Road for the following day. Afterwards, we headed to Indian Point Blagden Preserve about 15 minutes away. It’s a little known place with some trails that lead to the water. The Big Wood Trail there was unmarked, so we instead took the road down (there are some private properties along the road) and then took the Shore Trail, altogether about 1.5 miles one way. We were hoping to see some wildlife but were disappointed as we only saw a deer. Our plan for the day was to watch sunset that evening, so we headed back to Acadia National Park. To kill some time, we did another trail up to Bubble Rock. The parking lot for this trail is between Cadillac Mountain and Jordan Pond on Park Loop Road. The trail is only ½ mile one way but it is rocky and uphill, so it was a little challenging (I learnt that my memory foam shoes were not made for hiking). There is an intersection midway and we took the south trail. The view up there was gorgeous. Since it was too early for sunset, we went to Jordan Pond House for an early dinner, mostly for their popovers again. There was no wait and we had popovers, lobster salad, lobster, scallops, crab and lobster cakes, and BLTT sandwich (I know it’s a lot of food). Again, other than the popovers, the rest was mediocre especially considering the price. After dinner, we drove up Cadillac Mountain to Blue Hill Overlook, which faces west, for sunset. There is a sign for Blue Hill Overlook Parking before reaching the top. It was very cold and windy, but the sunset was absolutely beautiful.Day 7: We went back to the same parking lot as the day before, looking to do the 6-mile Eagle Lake Carriage Road. That parking lot, however, was full and we found another parking lot across, which is for Eagle Lake only. There is a kayak/boat launch area at the entrance. We went clockwise around the Lake, as we were told it was easier. Approximately two miles in, there was an option to continue on carriage road or take a 1.2-mile Eagle Lake Trail that tugs around the lake. Since the boys were bored by the carriage road, we took the Eagle Lake Trail, which was quite rocky. The trail eventually merges back on the carriage road. Since we had now worked up our appetite, and the boys had not checked out the Bar Harbor downtown (they were taking a kayak tour when we spent an afternoon there), we went there again. We went to Bar Harbor Popcorn and had their blueberry and cheddar popcorns, and then CJ’s Ice Cream & Yogurt and had their blueberry soft serve. They were all fantastic. We then walked around the shops, relaxed at the Town Pier a little, and since it was low tide, we were able to walk across the Sand Bar to Bar Island (look for sign and direction at the Town Pier). We were quite exhausted after all that and had an early dinner at The Stadium Restaurant and Gallery. This restaurant accepts reservations for lobster dinner, which is great if you are tired of waiting. For $30, you get a 1.25 lb. lobster, clam chowder, cornbread, coleslaw and corn. We did not expect so much food and we also ordered burger and hot dogs as well. The food was great and the staff was even greater. It was a perfect meal to wrap up our stay at Mount Desert Island.Day 8: This was our day of departure and we had approximately eight hours of driving to get home. So we got up very early and headed to Cadillac Mountain for sunrise, which is supposedly the first sunrise of the day in America. We arrived at the Cadillac Mountain summit at 4:45 AM. At that time, the parking lot was almost full. Although we were better prepared than the day we watched sunset, it was even colder. But it was absolutely worth it and the sunrise was amazing. Leaving Cadillac Mountain took a little time due to everyone leaving at the same time. On our return trip home, we stopped at Maine Diner in Wells for brunch. Wells is a town adjacent to Kennebunkport and this diner was seen in triple D on Food Network. The wait was about 30 minutes and the food was good diner food at a good price. We then drove straight home without incidence.To sum up, it was a wonderful trip that I think everyone should take at least once in their lifetime. All the people we came across were very kind and nice, and not once we felt we were treated differently or anything less (we are Chinese). We found both Portland and Mount Desert Island very family friendly, dog friendly and LGBT friendly, and we felt welcomed everywhere we went. The only disappointment with this trip was the scarcity of wildlife we saw, which I suppose was due to the season.After almost 20 lobster rolls, our survey (n=4) came to a unanimous decision: Red’s Eats was the best. Would we wait two hours again? Probably not, but I’ve been told that the line could be much shorter on a rainy day or if you arrive in the late afternoon. So time your visit wisely.","September 22, 2019",A Road Trip from New York to Acadia National Park,2,,5

Highlights are: Thunder Hole (but stay away from the edge), Jordan Pond, and the best is Cadillac Mountain on a clear day. Make sure you see the Southeast Harbor part of the park. We even went to the northern portion of the park. We went on the Carriage Roads which didn't impress, but it was in the rain so the weather may have been a factor. Make sure you walk around at Cadillac Mountain. Try Old Soaker blueberry soda at Jordan Pond, only place to eat in the park. There are moose, bears, seabirds and whale watching off the coast.

Acadia National Park,"This National Park has been on my list for awhile. Preparing for this trip looking by looking on the Park website, what the NPS doesn't prepare you for, is the amount of time driving for destinations. The distances aren't long, but the speed limits are 30-50MPH. There are five basic destinations, SW Harbor, NE Harbor, the Park Loop, and Bar Harbor, and the Schoodic peninsula, I stayed at the Seawall NP campground, on the SW Harbor, which is about 40 minutes away from the visitors center. There are local showers available 9AM-6PM daily except for Sunday, as the local store is closed. Other campgrounds refuse campers to buy on for a shower. The option is to travel to Blackwoods NP, which has 24 hr showers daily, which is about 50 minutes away. The hiking on trails are steep, crawling over granite rocks and hikers are guided by blue paint on rocks and trees. Many intersecting trails from the main trail, as plotted by the NPS Acadia hiking map can not be found. Some trail heads are readily seen from the park roads, and some are only designated by a carved stumped which can be easily overlooked.  Driving from the east side to the west side and vice versa is especially confusing, as to travel transversely, the driver must essentially make a U turn outside of Bar Harbor to turn around. Th e parking lots for the trail heads are small, so one needs to start early. Since most of the attractions are on the east side with the parking lot, it makes more sense to find lodging in the center of the island or on the east side.I'm glad I visited, but I didn't fall in love with the park, as millions have.","September 13, 2019",CONFUSING PARK,5,Waite Park,3

We started at Sand Beach, beautiful but the water was cold and it was August. Then off to Thunder Hole, now we were there during low tide and it looked like a bath tub. However, when the tide erupts, this water shoots up 20 feet or higher. Off to Cadillac Mountain, simply breathtaking. It is at the high point of the park, you can see for miles.

But first, I recommend you stop at the Visitor Center to pick up a map and ask a Park Ranger to recommend hikes based on your skill level. That was very helpful for us. Also, arrive early to get parking...we tried to get to Sand Beach around noon (first week of Sept) and the lot was already full. We wished we had a couple more days to explore more of Acadia.

Acadia National Park,"I am still struggling to believe that I have live most of my life less than 300 miles from this wonderful place, and had not visited before. What a treasure. We rented a house for the week to drop our elder son off t the University of Maine for his freshman year, and to explore the area. Great decision! We hiked Acadia on three separate days, covering Beehive (wow!), Cadillac Mountain and Bubble Rock, with the requisite stroll around Jordan Pond. The natural history, terrain and views of the surrounding area are breathtaking. Don't miss it.

It is one of very scenic points of Acadia. Do not miss it. If visiting nature in Horse Cart interest you, there is a place to visit but you need to book that in advance, plan your visit at least for 2-3 days and try to visit all points of it.

But once I got to see the nose I knew it was an Elk.I saw lobster traps being brought on board and the fisherman emptying them and re-baiting them and returning them to the ocean floor. The sounds of the waves hitting the shore and seeing the views from the top of Cadillac Mountain is all you need to do to forget about any problems you think you have.

Acadia National Park,"Started the day with the drive up to Cadillac mountain to see the sunrise...with about 500 other people...on a TUESDAY. Seriously, if you want to stay sane, get there super early (like at least 1 hour prior to sunrise) if you want to even think of getting parking spots. Be prepared to share the ""peaceful"" sunrise with TONS of other people. Go into that with that mindset and you'll be ok.Bring breakfast and stay up there for a while after sunrise, the people clear out quickly and you'll avoid a traffic jam at the exits.We decided to stay in the park and do a long hike vs leaving with everyone else who went back to their hotels for breakfast or whatever. It was nice, we saw only a few people at that hour. We then did the one-way loop around the park, making some stops here and there, in relatively peaceful (not a lot of people) manner.High tide was around 2PM, so we decided to go get an early lunch and come back around noon to see the phenomena at Thunder Hole. This is when everything went South. Traffic was the most insane I think I have seen at a park (again, on a TUESDAY). We were stuck in traffic before the entrance for at least an hour, and once you hit the one-way road into the park, you're stuck in it. I'm talking people with road rage, broken down buses stuck in the road, and another bus that sideswiped a car. No parking whatsoever once you get in, and the people are just everywhere.

The road that leads to the top, Cadillac Summit Road, is closed from December to April 14th — I didn’t know this until I had already driven two hours and got to the blocked-off entrance to the road. Probably should have checked the NPS website before I left, but I’m just sharing it here so you don’t have to!

Acadia National Park,"We were warned about the crowds in Acadia in July. Like many people, this was the only time of year we could visit. We were camping in Schoodic Woods (excellent) and took a ferry from Winter Harbor to Bar Harbor to avoid traffic coming into Bar Harbor and Acadia (ferry ride was the best part of our day). After locating the free Shuttle Explorer Bus (these buses are not in the same location as the other tour buses that are close to the ferry docks) we rode into the park alongside heavy private auto traffic. We got off the buses at several stops in the park only to be swarmed by people. We could not shoot photos without numerous other people in them. Cars were parked along many of the park roads and people were walking significant distances to get to overlooks. We had a picnic with a view of Jordan Pond-forget about the nearby restaurant-too crowded. We caught a bus and took ""the long way"" back to Bar Harbor so we could say we saw most of the park, at least in a very superficial way. The Shuttle Explorer buses do their part to reduce traffic congestion, but do not go to Cadillac Mtn. The drivers are nice and incredibly patient. I understand visiting the park in the next few years will be a completely different experience and hopefully a more positive one as there are plans to limit the number of people visiting at any given time. I will not be visiting again unless the experience is improved significantly.","August 18, 2019",Crowds ruined our visit.,1,,2

Acadia National Park,"This is a beautiful huge park with mountains, forest, and ocean views. I am handicapped and we did not find it particularly handicapped friendly. I was able to get to the top of Cadillac Mountain thanks to the handicapped accessible trail from the parking lot. This area is very crowded. We didn’t find much else that was easy to negotiate, even the rest areas and gift shops. We found that our best option was to see the coastline and some outer islands via a boat cruise.","August 17, 2019",Beautiful but Not for handicapped,42,"Houston, Texas",3

Acadia National Park,"One of the key highlights of our trip in New England. We spent a little bit of time considering whether to pay the $240+ for an escorted tour rather than driving ourselves, having been a little bit concerned about whether the quality of roads might be poor going up to Cadillac Mountain. We were so relieved that we had chosen to drive ourselves. The roads were exceptionally good with many one-way sections meaning that we did not have to worry about vehicles travelling in the other direction. Indeed the roads are wide and entirely safe and driving ourselves meant that we could keep stopping every time we saw a beautiful landscape, of which there were many. The circular route (Park Loop Road) was perfect for showing a range of aspects of the park and there were also regular parking areas for us to pull into. The cost to enter the park is very reasonable ($30/car) and due to the fact it’s enables multiple entries we returned for the evening to see the sunset at the top of the mountain and again for the morning to see the sunrise, resulting in some phenomenal photographs. Apart from the phenomenal landscapes the beach was also lovely as was Thunder Hole. We spent a full day there and my two teenagers loved it every bit as much as my husband and I. If we had another day we would have gone back, though a day was sufficient to hit the main highlights. Of our 15 days in New England, this for me was the main highlight.","August 17, 2019",Fabulous landscape,1,,5

Acadia National Park,"[8/12] Have returned to Acadia National Park with Family about 5-6 times over these past 15 years...it's beauty is something you can never get enough of...even the best photos can't replace experiencing it for yourself...truly incredible. My family used to live in nearby Winter Harbor, Maine (the OTHER, lesser-known Acadia National Park...go especially during the Winter Harbor Lobster Festival) back in the early 70's, and have made a point to return...for outdoor fun, for pictures, for memories, dining...just a chance to share this again with family & friends...a pure natural treat! :-D Do the whole park...the Visitor's Center, Jordon Pond House (superb popovers), the incredibly scenic old Carriage Roads ('Thanks' Rockefeller family for helping to create this!), Thunder Hole, the beaches...Bar Harbor...its all good.  You can fly into the nearby airport & rent a car, L.L. Bean offers a FREE Island Explorer bus service, the village green in Bar Harbor is a spectacular place to rest and get a coffee & pastry while you do a little sightseeing and shopping. There are aerial tours as well as water tours...and even a ferry between Acadia NP in Bar Harbor & Acadia NP in Winter Harbor. Plenty of restaurants, wonderful hotels & beautiful B&B's...and hey, you're in Maine...have a Lobster with Blueberry pie for dessert! Don't miss out on opportunities to pull over on the loop road up to/down from the summit of Cadillac Mtn. on Mt. Desert Island, to pick some wild blueberries. Hike around if you can (I'm in a wheelchair, so cannot...but there is a concrete path to the summit of the Mtn., and nearby wheelchair accessible parkin & and accessible bathroom at the gift shop at the top of the mountain, where you can also get snacks and post cards/souvenirs...take home some Maine maple syrup or blueberry jam). Don't miss this lifetime opportunity to see such natural beauty...make and take the time to complete this bucket list item...and really...don't be in a hurry...take the time to leisurely explore and enjoy, take it all in...cherish what you are seeing...pictures can remind, but not do justice...see it for yourself.

Acadia National Park,"This is our third trip back to Acadia and the amount of people visiting the park has grown tremendously. I would highly recommend parking at the visitor center and using the Island Explorer buses to navigate your way around. Parking is at a premium at many of the spots. You may find that some locations that you want to visit are quite packed and if you have the time, you may want to make an adjustment and head to a different part of the park.The views are tremendous and Cadillac Mountain is worth doing at least once.","August 16, 2019",Be prepared to adjust your plans,10,"Twin Mountain, New Hampshire",4
Acadia National Park,"So beautiful. I hadn’t been since childhood. Better than I remembered! We spent 3 days in Acadia. We stayed at Atlantic Eyrie( separate review), taking the shuttle into Bar Harbor. You pick up your weeklong park pass on the green at the Ranger Station. You can get the schedule of Ranger talks , and check and see any trail closures or warning. ( none for us). We picked up the Acadia shuttle also on the green and clearly marked. Just show your park pass. No additional charge. The shuttle takes a full loop around the park- stopping at trails and recreation areas along the way. We hopped off the first day at Sand Beach. Some families were hanging here for the day! Gorgeous and clean. We hiked to Otter point. About 2 miles. For great views stop and climb out on the rock promontories ! We explored this area for well over 2 hours. ( climbing shoes a must). The main path is easy. Depends how much exploring you want to do! There was a gift shop with snacks at Otter point ( and restrooms). This is where we had our first taste of a local soda called Old Soaker! Root Beer is good - Blueberry is outstanding! This is a must taste thing! We continued exploring via the shuttle popping on and off. Our second day we took the car driving out to seal beach and exploring less developed areas. Lots of fun nooks and crannies to explore. Pull off , park and hike! Definitely need bug spray here! That evening we drove to Cadillac mountain- about 5pm. Too early for sunset but all the morning fog was gone - and the views were breathtaking. We hiked about chatting with others who had come to wait for the sunset ( about 8:15pm). Many of these folks had gotten up early to see the sunrise here( about 5am). Our 3rd day in Acadia we had reservations ( a must) to Kayak on long lake. A morning explore on a clear day. Loons, eagles, ducks - bring your camera. The kayak excursion is for 3 hours. Plenty of time to explore. They also rent canoes and paddle boards. The afternoon was spent a Jordan pond. This hike is partially on boardwalks which were under construction. There is a restaurant here but we had reservations elsewhere. Wait time when we arrived was 1 hr. Bring water bottles and hiking shoes. There are bikes available to rent. We hiked. Lots to do in Acadia. We will be back ","August 15, 2019",Ahhhhhcadia! ,68,"monclova, ohio",5
Acadia National Park,"To tell you the truth I didn't want to go north on our Royal Caribbean Cruise. But I am so glad we did. Bar Harbor is beautiful and Acadia National Park is breathtaking. We enjoyed our bus ride to the park and visited various sites. My favorite was Thunder Hole. When the tide comes in it sounds like thunder, even though we didn't hear the full the effect it was was still awesome. A definite to do in Maine.","August 15, 2019",Beautiful,19,"Floral Park, New York",5
Acadia National Park,"Bar Harbor is a tender port. Best to leave the cruise ship early because there are lots to do and see here. We arrived at the tender dock around 9 AM. We walked up to the adjacent Agamont Park and asked the tourist officials there how we could hike the trails in Acadia National Park. They directed us up Main Street to the National Park services building. I told the ranger that we wanted to use the Island Explorer bus to go to Otter Cove and walk back to town. The ranger asked if we were ready for a 10-mile hike. No. She took out a map and circled Otter Cove and Sand Beach saying this is the most scenic hike and is a little more than 3-miles. Then she said the free Island Explorer bus loads passengers at Village Green, a little further up Main Street. There is a clock on Main and a gazebo in the park. The bus loads at the western side of the park in front of the fire and police stations. We loaded up and off we went into the beautiful park winding up hills and through dense forests. We passed many stops like Sand Beach, Blow Hole and finally arrived at Otter Cove, got out and entered the hiking trail. I would rate the hike as a moderate activity level two experience. It is not that smooth and would be tough for the ambulatory challenged. The scenery is breathtaking. Around a turn one can see Sand Beach far into the distance. Naturally the more you hike the closer you come. People started arriving in droves around noon and about 1 PM we had arrived at Sand Beach. There is an unobstructed view of Cadillac Mountain from the eastern end of the beach. After checking it out for a while, we boarded the Island Explorer and rode it back into town. I asked the driver where we could get a cheap beer and he said The Dog and Pony Tavern behind the fire station. We enjoyed a beer and a snack for a reasonable price and headed for the Shore Path, a 1/2 mile waterfront trail back to the dock. We were shopping for souvenirs at Oli's Trolley when the cashier asked if we were going on their trolley ride around town. Why not. We took the tour which was informative and entertaining then walked back to The Dog and Pony Tavern for a happy hour beer, now only $2. As it was getting close to time for the cruise ship to leave, we took the tender back and sat on the balcony overlooking the stunning beauty of this remarkable port. It turned out to be our favorite in our 14-day journey.","August 15, 2019",Hiking From Otter Point To Sand Beach And Beyond.,132,"Clearwater, Florida",5
Acadia National Park,"WOW, what a great place to visit and see nature at its finest. We had a rainy day for the 1st day of our visit so we took a trolley tour of the park (Oli’s Trolley - leaving from the waterfront in Bar Harbor). It is a great way to get a 2 1/2 hour tour and overview of the park, with 3 stops of 15 minutes to allow some additional exploring. This was a great overview for us to then be able to decide where we wanted to venture out on our own over the next few days. There are many points that should not be missed (Sand Beach, Jordon Pond, Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole). I found that a nice ~ 2 mile walk (each way) starting at Sand Beach to Thunder Hole was very enjoyable, great scenic spots to get down to the cliffs and rocky outcrops, a mild stroll along the loop road. The difficult of the trails offers something for everyone. Enjoy!","August 15, 2019",Acadia - A National Treasure,31,"Providence, Rhode Island",5

Acadia National Park,"The US National Parks are one of the undoubted success stories of this Nation and despite frequent assaults on its budget and status it continues to protect and preserve some of the country's most important and beautiful natural wonders.Acadia National Park is one such and is accessible to most people with lots to do for all ages and abilities. The park is not one piece of land but a sort of jigsaw puzzle wrapped around private land, towns and villages. One area, Schoodic Point, is an hours drive from the main site set on Desert Island. There are good roads throughout the park and beautiful vista points overlooking lakes and Atlantic coastline with innumerable little islands. There are walks and trails for all abilities including some serious climbing challenges.One of the most intriguing parts of the park are the carriage roads which are literally horse and carriage trails, although cyclists are welcome there are no cars. Private individuals can bring their horses into the park and use this 27-mile network of roads but visitors can really only access them on a carriage ride. These are either one or two hours long and well worth the expense. The majority of the roads were built by John D Rockerfeller Jr providing employment for skilled and unskilled labour. The roads and their bridges are fantastically well made, we were told they require little or no maintenance, and are beautiful to look at as is the scenery they pass through.There are several gift shops around notably at the main visitor centre, Jordan Pond House, with a good restaurant, Cadillac Mountain and more.

We were told to visit Cadillac during sunrise and yes, it is worth the early morning arrival. That also allowed us to get our day started before most of the crowds and we never had challenges finding parking and crushed a couple hikes before the lunch hour; Beehive and Jordan Pond","July 29, 2019",Cadillac of Parks,99,"Vancouver, Washington",4

The Park is popular and finding parking can sometimes be difficult. We never lost an opportunity due to parking though. With patience you can find a spot. The sunrise on Cadillac mountain is a must. Just beautiful. There are many different areas to explore in the park so always have a plan B to go to in the park if your plan A is too full or busy. Go to plan A another time or day. That worked great for us. Lots of great swimming holes and beaches along the hiking trails. Obtain a map and use the park guides.

Acadia National Park,"We enjoyed 2 days at Acadia, one of which was somewhat spoiled by rain. I suggest packing ponchos & wearing trail shoes. We were fortunate to enjoy trails almost to ourselves, despite it being high season. The top of Cadillac Mountain is magnificent on clear days. Jordan Pond and Waterfall Trails are also great low impact hikes. The signage could be better in parts of the park, and it would be nice to have a few more designated picnic spots & bathrooms.For those with National Parks Passes, the Pass covers both park admission and serves as your car entry fee, usually $30/vehicle.

The second was a drive of our own to stop at the various locations. Sand beach was beautiful, with the beach, ocean and awesome rock formations. Jordan Pond and the freshwater was stunning, I could have stayed there for hours. The water was so clear. Thunder Hole was pretty cool, we stayed for only 10-12 minutes, but hearing a wave crash into the cave, making a thundering sound, was time well spent.

Interesting natural phenomena, boats and Mount Cadillac.Bar Harbor is best approached using the shuttle bus from the visitors' centre (because of the parking problems).

Acadia National Park,"Here's my take on Acadia:The visitors center: My first stop is usually a stop at the visitors center to get a good overview of the park and watch the movies for perspective. The visitors center at Arcadia has one desk to purchase passes and another for information and a small store. Not as helpful as I hoped for.The Park: The park is broken into many pieces across the islands. I found it difficult to find my way around. The roads are not marked well, the maps are limited, the loop is only one way for some of the way and the most confusing is that the loop road crosses some of the main roads but don't have access on or off the loop and you have to detour to be able to get on to the loop. To make it more difficult, internet access is spotty and my cell phone battery drained to make the phone gps useless. I finally got the hang of it but suggest a good study of the roads before visiting.Crowds: Based on other reviews we were expecting huge crowds for mid July. There were crowds mid day in Bar Harbor but mostly because it's a small town and parking is limited. The parking in the park is very limited which makes it difficult in the middle of the day but I did not find the trails crowded. Just the parking lots small.Parking: We were out early and the parking lots along the coast were almost empty. We Parked down the loop road and hiked back toward Sand Beach and caught the shuttle back. By the time we got back to the parking lot a lot of cars were turned away with no spots available. Loop Road along the coast: Beautiful vistas with jagged rock cliffs over the water. My best part of the park is the section between Sand Beach and Thunder Hole. We stopped at Jordan Pond for a nice short walk along the lake. We got to Cadillac Mountain one afternoon and had plenty of parking. We went up for a 5am sunrise and had plenty of parking available at about 4:30am but the lot was pretty full by sunset. Shuttle: There are about 10 shuttle routes which is overwhelming until you figure it out. The shuttle center in Bar Harbor looks like the main transfer area and the staff was very helpful. We did have an afternoon fishing trip planned and the shuttle was more than 20 minutes late so be careful with their reliability. Camping: We camped at Blackwoods in a tent - Site A101. Our site was large, level and secluded enough from the other sites. It looked like most of the other sites were large enough but without a lot of screening for the adjoining sites. To be fair, that is just a general observation. Bathrooms were clean and less maintained. Showers are offsite but close for $2 (bring quarters). Ice and firewood are available at self serve stands along the road and just outside the campground.Lobster: We stopped at Pearson's to buy live lobster to grill at the campsite. Pearson's was great.Weather: was pleasant for the few days in mid July.Bugs: Based on the reviews we were concerned about flies and mosquitoes. Flies were not a problem at all and the mosquitoes were really not a big problem either and manageable with some OFF.Three days: Three days was good for us.","July 25, 2019",Three Days in Acadia,31,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",4
Acadia National Park,"We pack a lot into our vacations, so only had a day to spend at Acadia. The kids (11, 13, 15) were not overly enthused when we told them we were doing another National Park. However, they had a great time!We took the free bus from the visitor center - they run every half an hour, and if you plan well, you can get around with minimal waiting. It is great not to have to worry about finding a parking spot, and you can really enjoy the view of the park.On the recommendation of a ranger (who said it looked scary, but was very safe, and easily do-able, even for our 11 year old), we did the Beehive trail. It was really intimidating, but we were so glad we did it! We were surprised that there were some kids as young as 5 (or so) doing this challenging trail! If you plan to hike it, lighten the load on your backpack before hand!We went to Sand Beach, and we all enjoyed relaxing a bit, enjoying the ocean and the beautiful view. Next we went to Jordan's Pond, which was another beautiful area. After returning to the visitor center via bus, we took our car to Cadillac Mountain, where we enjoyed more panoramic views.The weather was perfect today, and the crowds were surprisingly light!It was a nice mix of activity, and can be as active or passive as you'd like it to be!

Expect crowds of most well-behaved visitors, stunning vistas, and some lovely hiking - there are hikes for all physical conditions and levels of commitments.

It was busy but not so busy that you couldn't drive up and find a parking spot. Going is definitely worth it! The panoramic views are gorgeous! The next day we drove to Hulls Visitor Center and took the Island Shuttle service. When you get on make sure to get one of their maps with their hours. The driver should have one. Look at it carefully so you know when they stop and pick up at certain times and places but they will also pick you up wherever you are when you flag them down. Their services are very well worth using instead of trying to find parking spots as you go along! Since we only had one day, we took the Park Loop Drive.

Acadia National Park,"I'm still making my way to as many national parks as I can, so Acadia was on my list. We were only able to spend 1.5 days in and around the park, so we took the advice of the park ranger and started the Loop Drive early in the morning. The shuttle stops at each main site every 30 minutes. The road is one way from the northern point of the loop until Jordan Pond. It is two-way from just south of Jordan Pond until just past Cadillac Mtn. We chose to follow the one-way portion first. I'm unsure if it matters, since the park is so crowded this time of year. We stopped at Thunder Hole area. By mid-morning the parking along Sand Beach was quite lengthy. The beach was beautiful, especially appreciated since most national parks aren't located along the ocean. Jordan Pond had no parking at noon and Cadillac Mountain's access road was closed by rangers in the afternoon. Know your tide tables, so you can make the most of low tide. We hiked across the land bridge from Bar Harbor at low tide. In the afternoon we headed to The Quietside and hiked around Beach Mountain. The ranger said it was a moderate trail. It seemed a good representative trail and had some pretty vistas of Long Pond. We also went to Ship Harbor and hiked out to the ocean. This was the only place we encountered mosquitoes. The lighthouse was interesting to see, but the parking entrance was tight and the lot was crowded.","July 8, 2019",National Beauty,7,"Yorkville, Illinois",4

Acadia National Park,"Our family had visited Bar Harbor, ME and Acadian National Park for the first time. This place was so beautiful and amazing. There are so many places to stop along the scenic road through Acadia and there are many places to hike as well. There are even waterfalls that you can hike to in the park. There are many scenic areas to stop and park and walk down on the roads to see the ocean waves splashing against the rocks. The views were amazing and were breathtaking. I shared some of the pictures that I took.There are several areas tahatyou can climb down on the rocks along the scenic loop road through the park. You need to wear comfortable shows that give you traction. Some of the rocks can be slippery and you can easily fall. Some of the areas are also uneven terrain so you need to be careful when walking around so do not fall.The park cost $ 30.00 for a 7 day pass through the National Park Service and it was so worth it. The park has a gift shop as well with unique gifts and one of a kind treasures from Acadia to take home with you.There is parking off scenic pullouts and as well as some parking lots as well. There are two lanes in each direction through the park and guests are allowed to park int he right lane and there is only one lane going through in each direction at times. Just be careful pulling in and out of traffic in the park. Also be on the lookout for moose and other wildlife as well.We loved visiting Acadia National Park and would definitely visit again in a heartbeat and I highly recommend it!","July 7, 2019","""Beautiful, breathtaking scenery""",239,"Willow Grove, Pennsylvania",5

We’ve visited quite a few NPs from Alaska and Hawaii to Montana, Utah, and Colorado to Tennessee and Maine...ANP definitely ranks in the top three. We love the carriage trails, hiking, biking, the ocean, the mountains/hills, the forest, the streams, the vistas...all of it!

It has something for everyone.We took our bikes and did we ever get a workout! There are carriage trails through the mountains and you can hike or bike on them. We did so every day, but I must tell you it was quite a challenge, but the sights and experience were terrific.

Acadia National Park,"Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island has it all. The town of Bar Harbor on the eastern edge of the park is both tourist cute and old Down East quaint. There's no shortage of good restaurants and charming shops. Whale watching, kayak rentals, guided fishing trips, are just a few of the available activities. The view from the village green overlooking the harbor basically sums up what draws people to this region. The rocky and tree-covered shoreline, the boats tethered at docks while other anchored offshore all display the many reasons why people find this town irresistible. Nearby Cadillac Mt draws crowds by car and by foot. The view from the top is serene.both a mixture of expansive ocean, beautiful islands, and the rugged landscape of coniferous forest, and windblown shrugs clinging to rock outcrops. Sunrises are spectacular up there. Acadia Nat Park has countless hiking trails leading to sparkling lakes and ponds. Mainers tend to understate things so a small lake is often referred to as a pond but they're often surprisingly large. But you'll find after a while that understatement is a state of mind that seems just right.","July 5, 2019","Acadia Nat Park, an unlikely blend civilized, rugged & serene",12,"Gainesville, Florida",5

For a one day trip Acadia is a good place to visit. There are very few things to really see in this park. If you love hiking this is a really good place. The main attraction I felt was the beach. Beach was really excellent and well situated. Other attractions doesn't take that much time to cover.

Acadia National Park,Spent a lovely morning going around the exquisite Jordan Pond. About 3.4 miles around the entire pond. We started clockwise from the entrance. This side boasts more marshy areas that are traversed via raised platforms. Volunteers were adding to the platforms so we were detoured a little ways through the woods. A bit muddy after heavy rains. The next section is mostly granite rock which is fun for those without mobility issues. The other side of the pond boasts a broad firm-packed walkway.

The park is serious about erosion and conservation, not allowing visitors to walk on the rocks, and not allowing more than 2 buses at a time at the top, for a stop of only 20 minutes.

Acadia National Park,"Simply stunning! So we arrived here on a bad weather day but boy was it worth going back the second day! The first day was Sunday June 30 and raining and the parking lots were either half or mostly empty due to the weather. The second day we had a bit of a late start and it was much busier but not overwhelming. We did not do any hikes. Here are tips:1. Car or shuttle? - I was told time and time again don’t drive but I decided to ignore the advice and take my chances and I’m glad I did. This was my experience so perhaps it could differ as we get further into summer but when we went it was a bad weather day mid afternoon and driving was fine! The road was completely open for driving throughout the park unlike places like the Grand Canyon where it’s closed partly to only buses. We were fine the next day too which was a Monday and very Sunny. Again all roads open for major attractions including sandy beach, thunder hole, Cadillac mountain and Jordan pond. If you take the car and it’s a sunny day, start early!! We took a drive out to sea wall and didn’t get to Acadia for the second day until about 915. Sandy beach was pretty full In terms of parking and so was Jordan pond. Cadillac mountain was totally full and there was a wait for parking. People also weren’t quick to leave. 2. When to go and can you do it all: like I said above start early if you have nice weather! Like 730 or 8 so you can take time at the popular sites. If you do this you may be able to visit all the popular sites by car. Start with sandy beach, then thunderhole, ottercliff, Cadillac mountain and then Jordan pond. 3. Buy an America beautiful park pass if you’ll be visiting this park for several days and other parks in the us: one day pass for a car is 30 and the pass for a year is 80 unless you’re retired.4. Visitor center: worth stopping by to get maps and visit the shop. Some nice souvenirs but tee shirts are overpriced and you can find some nice ones in town at bar harbor. There are lots of steps going up but there’s also an accessible entrance. Restrooms also here.5. Sandy beach: a must stop! No dogs allowed. Public restrooms. Beautiful view. Parking lot fills up fast. If you don’t find parking here get out of the lot and park on park loop rd. 6. Otter cliff: signs aren’t readily visible. Parking is right before you get to a bend with tiered walled roads that split in two. Park before you get to the tier and walk across the street. Lovely views here on the rocks. 7. Thunder hole: hit or miss. Visited TWICE and no action unfortunately. We went at low tide and two hours before high tide and even stayed an hour but no action. Heard that action happens when there’s a storm and it’s two hours before high tide. Who knows though. Restrooms here but think they were the outhouse kind. Also a small gift shop and parking lot. 8. Jordan pond: parking lot at the house but also for just those visiting the pond a little further down the road. Nice views and worth the stop. Food is not worth the stop. Wrote a review about it and you can check it out. Restrooms available here. 9. Cadillac mountain: go early as this gets busiest fast! People also spend time up here so parking doesn’t change over quickly. Great views. If you can’t find parking there are a few pull over places on the way down with nice views too. 10. Last tips. Part of park loop is one way. Cadillac and Jordan has areas of two way lanes. There are adjacent and perpendicular roads but pay attention to signs because they’re easily missed and the next thing you know you’re driving around the whole park again! Cell service is very spotty so don’t think google maps will save the day. Don’t stay past close to dusk as the park empties quickly and it’s easy to get lost as there are no road lights in the park. People frequently park in the right lane on the one way roads so watch out! Lots of pedestrians on roads to in random places so take care!

Acadia National Park,"We spent a week in Bar Harbor and went to Acadia every day. It is so beautiful, rain or shine. Our first day there it was raining hard but we saw some beautiful waterfalls that day. On the sunny days, we got up early and were at the park by around 6 am in order to beat the crowds so we could look for wildlife and do some hiking. We particularly enjoyed seeing the nesting peregrine falcons and their fledglings at Precipice Trail and also on the carriage road above Jordan Pond. There is so much to see and do but you have to get out of your car and hit the trails or carriage roads to really experience all the park has to offer, especially the wonderful smell of Christmas trees.Traffic was not bad during the early morning hours and we usually left by noon everyday. Be careful before starting any trails and don't start without a map, especially if you are not used to climbing rocks. Our only complaint would be the water runoff problem at Hulls Cove Visitors Center. When it is raining, water is rushing down the path and steps that you have to walk up to the building. It was like a water fall and then was puddled 3"" deep at the bottom. There was no way to walk around the water so everyone was having to walk through it. Our shoes and socks were soaked.

We returned to Jordan Pond, and it made the Park Pass worthwhile. Jordan Pond is a beautiful relaxing place. I would imagine the hike around this big pond would be awesome.We enjoyed the drive around Acadia National Park. Acadia National Park isn't near the level of Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountains or Crater Lake. However, it is a nice park in Maine and one of the best attractions.","June 18, 2019",Wonderful National Park near the Maine Coast,362,"Katy, Texas",4
Acadia National Park,"We loved Acadia National Park. The highlights were Sand Beach, the Great Head hike, the Otter Cliff coastline, Cadillac mountain, and we actually hiked and liked Acadia mountain on the other side of the island as well. We did think that Jordan Pond was underwhelming for the hype. We also went over to the Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse which probably wasn't worth the drive over. Basically any of the mountains with views over the ocean or hikes along the ocean, we thought were stunning and amazing. ","June 18, 2019",Loved Acadia National Parkw,83,"Dallas, Texas",5
Acadia National Park,"Acadia may be a smaller National Park, but it has plenty to see and do. That is why you will want at least 3 days and more if possible to experience this park. Take a hike as there are easy to very demanding hiking trails.The scenery on one of these hikes is remarkable. Take a bus tour to hear the information and gain a better understanding of the park and how it came to be. Take a carriage ride if time and weather permits. Do not forget your camera as between the shoreline scenery and the mountaintop vistas you will want to save the experience. We came at the request of our daughter and boy were we glad we visited.

Hiking is great because you can find trails for all ages. Great views from the top and many super views going up or coming down or both. Some have ladders, some iron rungs and others with beautiful granite steps. Scrabbling over rocks is fun for all ages. The biking trails were once carriage trails and one can still book a ride on a carriage but bikes are perfect. Many beautiful bridges were built and are beautiful as well as functional. As you bike up mountains you are rewarded by ever expanding ocean views. Kayaking can be in the ocean or on placid ponds. Views and wildlife are beyond words.

The interior of Acadia is as beautiful as anything you are likely to see on the east coast: round-top mountains, grassy fields, streams, lakes with beaver huts, wildflowers, etc. The coastline is a crazy bonus with large rocky outcroppings challenging the sea waves, lobster boats, sea birds and lighthouses. Cadillac mountain rises out of the surroundings as a mass of green lichen covered pink granite interspersed with wildflowers providing 360 degree views to Bar Harbor, Egg Island and the general beauty of Mount Desert Island.

If you enter by Sand Beach, there is a wait to get through the park gate even if you have a pass, don't worry, just show the ranger and be on your way.We hiked The Beehive, Gorham Trail, Jordan Pond, Ovean Path, Bubble Trail, The Bowl, Great Head Trail, and more. Sand Beach was awesome. Huge waves crashing on the beach. Water is a little cold though, right around 45°F-50°F.

Lots of hiking for all levels of hikers. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the map you get when you pay the entrance fee is terrible. There are trails not listed on the map. You get to a trail head and trying to figure out which directions to go was a bit confusing, since there are many different trails/directions to take. My husband and I met a nice young man that was a local and stopped him to see if we were headed in the right direction. He asked if we had the Park map and said it ""stinks"" (his word was much worse). He let us take a picture of his map with our phones, which was a big help. Also not a lot of information about what to expect as some trails have ladders and rungs and there can be some rock scrambling. Spring or early to mid summer is not the best time to go if you want to do the Precipice, the Falcons are nesting during this time. So it is best to check with Park to see when this trail is open.

We learned that later in the summer the Island Explorer bus can be used to reach trailheads, but it wasn't running this early in the season. That said, we were able to take advantage of a few quiet spots.

The birch trees are ghostly white with buds about to burst. The ponds and lakes are peaceful - just us and the ducks and lions. The restaurants in Bar Harbour that are open are fabulous - they are the ones the locals frequent- like Blaze. Put your hiking boots on and hike up from Jordan Pond House along the South Ridge Trail gradually ascending to the summit of Pemetic Mountain for stunning views along the way and even more beauty at the summit. If you are hearty and your knees are up for it, descend the steep and scramble backside down the North Ridge trail to Bubble pond then walk the carriage road and the Jordan Pond trail back (about 4 hours total). Or hike back down the way you came for a 2-2.5 hour round trip. Don’t bother hiking up Cadillac Mountain when you can drive it (at sunrise! It’s worth it!) and instead hike the more remote peaks without the cars and people. Cycle the carriage roads, rent a kayak, walk the shoreline trail in town.

Have been going up to both several times over the past decade and a half (lived in Winter Harbor in the early 70's...still have friends there). Absolutely incredible. Would strongly suggest you hit the 'Winter Harbor Lobster Festival' (taking Dad up there again this year), and will visit old memorable sites from early childhood...out there, the beauty doesn't change. Go in early August, after the black flies & mosquitoes have settled down and gone.  Bar Harbor is sort of a quaint Victorian walking village with a village green surrounded by small shoppes and bistros and places to get some coffee and a pastry, then off to stroll around the town, down by the water front...it is all just incredibly relaxing. Winter Harbor is a nature-scene painter's/photographer's delight...less of a tourist crowd. Big 'Thanks' to the Rockefeller family for their incredible and continued support of the local towns, and to the Dixon (Dixon pencils) and Campbell (soup) families who also support the local towns.

The drive up and down Cadillac Mtn. is incredible...take photos (and pick wild blueberries). Go to the Jordon's Pond House Restaurant for pop-overs and local strawberry jam...what a tasteful treat. Sample the local restaurants in / near/ around both Winter Harbor and Bar Harbor...you won't regret it...wonderful memories...even 40 years later...enjoy life in BOTH (actually...ALL...because there are SEVERAL islands, accessible by boat tours) Acadia National Parks.

Acadia National Park,"We visited Bar Harbor and Acadia NP in October and the leaves were nearing their peak. It was beautiful to drive loop road which circles the east side of the park, and hike along the shore by Sandy Beach, around Jordan Pond, and on top of Cadillac Mountain. If you enjoy hiking and being outside, try to plan 3 or more days here. Although the NP is small compared to the NPs out west, there are some beautiful hike and some amazing scenery. A few thinks to be aware of: - Like most (all?) NPs, there is an entry fee that is good for about a week.  - Part of the road is one-way, and the best way to drive through the NP is clock-wise starting at Bar Harbor and driving south toward Sandy Beach.  - Even where the road is two directions, expect the traffic to move very slow. People are crossing the road, parking and pulling out, and looking at the sights.  - Parking can be limited, so you may have to wait for a spot. Again, be patient - most people do short walks so spaces open up frequently. We would head to the hike we wanted to do most in the morning, by-passing some of the busier spots and spending several hours on a longer hike. A few great hikes are: - From Sandy Beach to Thunder Hole and back. This hike has several options. You park near Sandy Beach and can hike down to the beach. There is a hike from from the far side of the beach along the coast (a bit more rugged than the rest of the hikes in this area and more exposed along some of the cliffs.) There is also a hike that begins by the road, is fairly level and paved. From this well maintained path/sidewalk you can take many short spurs to the rocks and cliffs overlooking the water. There are dozens of amazing views and photo ops along this hike which goes on for several miles.  - Jordan Pond - There is a huge parking lot, restaurant, gift shop, etc. on the southern tip of Jordan pond. There is also a loop hike (about 2-3 miles) that circles Jordan Pond. If you hike around Jordan pond starting on the east side (going counter-clockwise), the trail is fairly level and well maintained. At about the half-way point the trail become rockier and there is some scrambling over rocks. At about the three-quarters point you have to walk on an elevated trail that is two boards wide, maybe 1-2 feet off the ground, with no handrails. Not a good spot if you have balance problems. The hike itself is beautiful with some great views. Most people hang out around the shops, so you get peace and solitude during the hike. Bubble Rock Hike - Of the 3 hikes listed this would be the most challenging. You access the parking area for Bubble rock on the road heading north from Jordan pond. The trail is up a large hill with several overlooks until you reach the top and bubble rock. It can be a decent workout, but the trail is safe and isn't exposed.

We stayed overnight in Hudson.Then the vacation began on the next day.We stopped in downtown Boston in the morning. Walked the Freedom Trail( almost 2 hours). Took Lyft back to the Visitor Center in Boston Common after our last stop at the USS Cassin Young. We drove to Salem. Watched a documentary at the Visitor Center ( paid small fee for tickets). Took the hop on hop of bus. It was great if you are short on time. We love Salem Harbor. We visited Salem Witches Trial Memorial. It was emotional. We also visited the House of Seven Gables. It was a neat experience. Stayed overnight at the Fairfield Inn in Amesbury( good breakfast). Left the hotel to around 8am. Got to Bar Harbor after 1pm. We stayed 3 nights at the Bar Harbor Inn ( ocean front room). The room is ok but the view is awesome. We had dinner at Main restaurant, the Reading Room. It was great. They had a pianist playing on the baby grand during dinner time. Lunch at the Terrace Grill was also good. We did the scenic drive, Thunder Hole, Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond....The weather was iffy the first two days: very cloudy. It was like a heavy curtain shrouded the island. We hardly saw anything. The water and the Sky were grey and looked like they were connected. Luckily, we finally saw some sun on the last day. The Harbor view was breathtaking. All the way home, we made a stop at the LL Bean flagship store in Freeport and the lighthouse in Portland. Overall, it was a great trip. My husband and my son loved all kind of lobster dishes.

Acadia National Park,"Undoubtedly the most beautiful scenery in the park can be found along the Ocean Path. Because of the stellar views, this is also the most crowded place to be and parking can be difficult. Plan to arrive and park in the Sand Beach parking lot before 9:00AM to guarantee an easy parking spot. After 10 or 11, you will not be able to park anywhere close until later in the day. Sand Beach parking lot includes restrooms, changing areas and water fountains for visitors. From this point, I recommend starting the morning with a hike to the top of the Beehive. The trailhead is walking distance from the Sand Beach parking. This is a strenuous but rewarding hike. Majority of the time you will be climbing up iron rungs. I actually really enjoyed this hike and didn’t think it was as challenging as all the reviews lead me to think. There will be a sign at the trailhead warning you that people have died and seriously injured themselves doing the hike. As long as you go slow and are smart and safe about it, it should be no problem. This hike is one of the most popular in the park, so starting early is highly recommended to avoid the crowds. You will not go back down the same way you go up, so once you reach the summit enjoy the ocean views and head back down the otherside of the mountain.There are options to extend the hike on the way down, so I recommend looking into those options. We ended up heading straight back to the ocean front and walked the Ocean Path. This is a walk, not a hike, but runs directly along the ocean so the views are epic. There are lots of little stops you can make along the way. Thunder Hole is awesome! The best time to go is during high tide, so later in the afternoon is best. Walk at least out to Otter Cliffs. Here you can sit on the cliffs, drink your hiking wine, and watch rock climbers tackle the rocky shore.","December 1, 2018","""Seas"" the Day at Acadia",58,"Chicago, Illinois",5

The road through the park starts out as a two land road with two way traffic. It then turns into a two lane road with one way traffic. If the parking lots are full cars are free to park in the right lane in some areas. Be sure to follow the directions that are posted.

We bought our passes at the National Park information building, which made entry very easy. There are a couple different options once in the park - a long complete loop at a partial loop. We took the partial look which still took several hours. I was able to walk down some of the trails to get great photos, but even my friend was able to enjoy the park from the overlooks which didn't require much walking.

I was there at the end of October and would have loved to see it then.

Acadia National Park,"We spent a week visiting Acadia, we chose mid September to avoid the crowds and were so pleased. Although the weekend is still busy, you could find parking most of the times and the hikes were not crowded. Our favorite was the Beehive. It was challenging but well worth the views! We also took a couple boat excursions, one at sunset and loved being on the water. We also took a wagon ride on the carriage roads and learned about the history of the park. The color was only about 25% at that time so we definitely will go back in October next time. Overall it was a fantastic trip. We got a nonstop flight from Chicago to Bangor. We stayed at a wonderful resort in Bar Harbor and ate lots of lobster and other wonderful seafood! Truly a fabulous trip!","November 2, 2018",Acadia is incredible!,1,"Bar Harbor, Maine",5

Acadia National Park,"I have wanted to see this park since I was a little girl and never dreamed I would get anywhere near it. We had one day to see what we could see and I thank other reviewers who shared what they did in a day. We visited the end of October so many of the shops and stops along the way were closed or only parts of things open. There were a lot of people, but not so many that we couldn't get around easily. We first went to the main visitor's center and stamped our book, picked up a map, bought our patch and Christmas ornament - all things you have to do when you visit a national park! Then we headed down right way to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse. We misread the map and ended up on a loop that circled around - we only went around twice before we figured that out or we maybe would be still on it! So watch that map there! We first walked around to the right of the lighthouse and it is not the iconic view we were expecting. The path to the left is the one you want and it leads to a steep set of stairs that leads down to boulders on the shore. You climb over boulder after boulder after boulder to get as close as you can to the water and look up and there is the view of the lighthouse everyone wants! I am 60 and had hurt my knee before the trip, but had waited to long not to try it. So down the stairs I went, and out over the boulders (with help ha ha) and was so glad I was able to see it. An immature loon popped up out of nowhere and showed off a bit, then we saw this ""floating head"" and it was attached I am sure to the body of a seal, but all we saw was the face looking at us. Very cute and it disappeared too soon down in to the ocean. After this we headed up to the main loop, stopped at Jordan Pond and then made another long stop at the top of Cadillac Mountain. There are no words to describe the view. It was a little cold, but we all had coats with hoods and were fine. There are a lot of places to walk around and lots of places to take pictures. If you only have one day like we did, we felt we had gotten a really good idea of what the park is like by seeing the lighthouse and Cadillac Mountain. The colors this time of year were amazing as well. Can't wait to go back and spend more time!","November 2, 2018",Have Always Wanted to Visit and it did NOT Disappoint!,96,Minnesota,5
Acadia National Park,"I spent three hours in Acadia National Park on a small tour bus. Even though we stopped very often for photographs, I wish I could have spent all day in the park exploring. There is so much to see, so many trails to walk and so much history to absorb. I won't repeat many kudos of prior reviewers, but I do suggest you read their reviews. Even though Acadia may be small in area, You will not be disappointed in this National Park.

Acadia National Park,This is certainly not a large National Park but is one of my favorites. The trails are incredibly well kept and the drives are constantly scenic. The drawback is the volume of visitors during our visit in September we bypassed several sites due to lack of parking.

Acadia National Park,"First off, we went with a 25 year old, not a teen and we are complete nature lovers. The park can take many days to actually go through so if you have limited time, the must sees are Jordan Pond, Thunder Hole, Sand Beach. We could have spent hours just sitting on rocks and watching the waves crashing, it was that awesome. But read about the park in other reviews. I just want to give some money and time saving tips.We stayed in Lincolnville and drove 2.5 hours to the park. The reason was Bar Harbor is a very touristy place and the hotels are not that great and overpriced. Also the Atlantic Highway drive from Camden/ Linconville is breathtaking and since we went in the fall, it was present in all its glory! It was definitely time well spent. Lincolnville has some beautiful B&Bs, with phenomenal views, very quiet and serene. We enjoyed our sunrises there and some delicious breakfast at Dot’s (a quaint bakery with delish homemade goodies). The best way to see the park is to drive in to Bar Harbor and take advantage of the free parking at the end of Main Street. Then walk back to the square in MainStreet (10 min) and take buses to the park. The LLBean buses take you to different spots in the park and they are free of charge. They only run until the Sunday of Columbus Day weekend- important! You can use the buses to go to and from various stops inside the park and eventually back to Bar Harbor Square. No headache of payment of $30 for parking inside the park, nor looking for parking which is hard to do. Bar Harbor itself is a lovely town with all the activity concentrated on Main Street; usual souvenir stores, restaurants, and speciality stores. We didn’t eat there as we had gotten custom made sandwiches from Dot’s and had a picnic in the park. Best to take food and drinks and water with you as it’s not easily available all over the place. Wet wipes and Kleenex as well some very basic first aid is a good idea to carry along in your backpack. Sneakers are the way to go as there are several trekking and hiking trails and it’s mountainous and rocky in some parts. Gets cool, so a jacket is always a good idea.

We stopped at Sand Beach and walked the 1.5 mile path each way to Thunder Hole. Not the best path to chose as most of it ran along the road, my fault for not knowing. We arrived at the Jordan Pond House expecting to try the popovers, it was closed for the season. Nowhere on the website did it mention this. Glad we had some snacks and drinks with us.

Acadia National Park,"Neither my husband nor I are in rigorous hiking shape, but the 27-mile park loop is perfect. You can get most scenic views just a few steps from your car; others require a short, mostly non-strenuous walk. I think everything is pretty wheelchair-accessible, too. It's a wonderful way to see the fall color and the scenic surroundings without having to strap on a backpack. The admission is reasonable and the gift shop has a lot of cool stuff. (There are also smaller gift shops at the main attractions.)","October 28, 2018",Wonderful for a non-hiker,19,"Pensacola, Florida",5
Acadia National Park,"The Acadia loop is one of the best loops in the mountain's lap. There are about 6 stops in the complete loop so you would want to hit the road early in the day so you can enjoy the views and be back by evening.

Acadia National Park,"Acadia National Park is our favorite vacation destination. We usually go up in fall, to enjoy the spectacular foliage. Now that Bar Harbor is a regular stop for cruise ships, the town and the park’s main attractions can get very busy, but Acadia is so big it doesn’t take much effort to escape the “madding crowd.” Cadillac Mountain, Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and the Park Loop Road will probably require patience, but a hike up Gorham Mountain or around Great Head will get you in away from the tour buses and in touch with nature. I recommend starting at the Hull’s Cove Visitor Center to buy your park pass ($30 per vehicle, good for seven days), check the weather and tide forecast, and see what ranger-led programs might interest you. I also highly recommend the Acadia National Park (waterproof) Trail Map, which shows distances and contour lines, invaluable for planning a hike, a bike ride along the gravel carriage roads, or a cross-country run. In addition to road and trail maps, it also provides a brief description of the most-popular hikes. Time and weather permitting, a drive around the 27-mile Park Loop Road would be a good sampler of what Acadia has to offer, after which you can better plan how to spend your time—on the rocky coast, which can be spectacular if the weather and tides are in your favor, or hiking up one of the granite mountains for a view over the Atlantic, or enjoying a ramble along a brook through a spruce and balsam pine forest. We bike the Park Loop Road at least once each trip. After several years of starting from the Hull’s Cove parking lot, we hit on the idea of parking at Jordan Pond (in the overflow lot) in the morning, then finishing our ride with popovers and lobster stew at the Jordan Pond restaurant. This lets you get the long climb up from Jordan’s Pond out of the way while you are still fresh, and avoids the traffic between the Hull’s Cove Entrance and Eagle Lake Road.We travel with our two dogs, which are allowed on the carriage roads and most of the hiking trails (Beehive trail, which traverses a series of ledges with the aid of iron rungs drilled into vertical granite walls, is not dog-friendly). Sand Beach and Echo Beach are off-limits to dogs during peak season (May-September).","October 28, 2018",America's Premier National Park,47,"Alexandria, Virginia",5

Don't forget to check out the Schoodic Peninsula, which has less crowding and gorgeous views. We drove all the area roads, stopped in the little towns and enjoyed all things Acadia.

Acadia National Park,Our visit matched everything I always heard about Acadia. We parked our car at Sand Beach and walked the Ocean Path Trail. Spectacular views. Many pictures. We got there early on a late September Saturday so the trail was not too crowded. However at some points like Thunder Hole there would be bus loads (2 or 3) letting off passengers to view so we walked ahead and stopped on our way back to Sand Beach. Also later as we planned to drive up to Cadillac Mountain the Park Rangers had it barricaded and were waving you on with words to come back in an hour. This was about noon time so not at crowded times for sunrise or sunset on Cadillac. Later back in Bar Harbor we heard that when big cruise ships port and send bus loads of people out to Acadia they shut down Cadillac Mountain when bus loads up there.

And the top of Cadillac...the drive up is awesome....the wind and trails, views and geological science behind it...love....so windy and cold our first day our eyes teared and froze a bit...and it was great! Next day, the clouds, sun, blue skies, ocean, reds of the low bushes and green growth on the rocks...just great!!!!!!! We are two, older friends travelling together, we felt safe and comfortable throughout the park.

We were thrilled, were fortunate to have a beautiful sunny day and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, including a splurge lunch at Jordan Pond. We were very annoyed by the tour guides at the dock who were trying to sell us something so overpriced when there was such a reasonable local option available..For further information, ask where the National Parks information office is, it is a short walk from the docks.

Acadia National Park,"We went to Acadia to celebrate our 10th anniversary. It was already a special, meaningful time, and Acadia only added to the experience.We saw Acadia at peak color - nature's fireworks in hues of red, gold, and orange interspersed with the green of the pines. The vegetation is lush, but with only 20 inches or less of soil, there is an abundance of granite rock formations to view as well and vistas off to the Atlantic. We saw a variety of weather from sunny and hot on the first day to pouring rain the second. Even a rain day made for special times: waterfalls falling over cliff ledges that were not there the day before, amping up the volume at Thunder Hole, no lines at Cadillac Mountain. We just grabbed a poncho and made do.We found the Jordan Pond Trail and Jordan Pond Stream Path to be must do hikes. Both are fairly easy, though the former has a bit of a bouldering section in the middle. We also challenged ourselves to find as many carriage road bridges as time allowed, including hiking those in the Upper Hadlock Pond area. That hike was a bit more challenging with steeper ascents/descents. All beautiful hikes.In reviewing some of the lower ranked reviews, I wanted to comment on a few things. First, one must note that Acadia is the largest national park east of the Mississippi. Given that...""It's really expensive for a national park."" Actually, we found that a visit to Acadia can be done fairly moderately. There is a variety of privately owned lodging and dining options just outside of the park (in Bar Harbor and elsewhere on the island), unlike other parks like Yellowstone or Yosemite, where the park concessionaire is your only option. Here, you get a large say in how much you want to spend.""It's overcrowded."" I don't even really know how to respond to that other than to ask whether the individual has ever been to a national park? Yes, you can get into a traffic jam here and there. As you can with bison-jams in Yellowstone. Or trying to find a parking spot at the Lodge at Yosemite Falls (or whatever it is called now). National parks are tourist destinations. Have some patience, take in the fresh air and beautiful sites, and just chill already.""The gift shop at the Visitor's Center had nothing."" There are three other gift shops in the park - Jordan Pond, Thunder Hole, Cadillac Mountain. And dozens of shops in Bar Harbor.","October 19, 2018",Breathtaking Must Do,41,"Saginaw, Michigan",5

Acadia National Park,"Visited Acadia in the Fall and the trees there and across the island were stunning. The park is very wild and beautiful, but compared to many other National Parks we have visited, we found it to be poorly marked and lacking ample parking. A drive up to the main attraction, the views from Mount Cadillac, was not difficult, though the road was winding. Reaching the top, however, we had to inch forward in traffic for 10-15 minutes to get a parking place. When we left the line was even longer. As we continued around the 20 mile loop road, we could not find a parking place at Jordan Pond, and never did find two other attraction spots because we did not see turnoff signs. Having said that, it is the second most visited park and worth your visit.","October 14, 2018",Beautiful Vistas but Parking Is a Premium,65,"Conyers, Georgia",4

There are many places to park and enjoy the view or walk down a path to get several different views. If you are a photographer like I am, you will spend many hours with your camera. The view from Cadillac Mountain gets better and better as you go up. They say that the sunrise is beautiful at the peak but you have to get there early if you want a parking space.

That would be one of a few things that I could have done without. I can’t imagine what it’s like in the summer.

It's all wonderful. Except for the crowds (which is why this place gets only 4 stars). Parking is almost impossible - especially at popular spots like Jordan Pond, Sand Beach, and Thunder Hole.

Acadia National Park,"We spent 3 days hiking and sightseeing at Acadia National Park. I would say that was the perfect amount of time to visit. My husband and daughter hiked the Beehive and Precipice Trails and they loved them. It was some of the most difficult, scary and rewarding hikes they have ever done.(See other posts on these trails) Must be very fit to do them and no fear of heights. Other trails that we all enjoyed was the South Bubble Trail to Bubble Rock. (Make sure not to miss the view of Jordan Pond once you are at Bubble Rock. Head down a short path toward Jordan Pond once you reach the top) We also enjoyed the Great Head Trail, and Ocean Trail. All the trails we hiked had some amount of rock scrambling and elevation change. We had lunch and popovers at Jordan Pond House. The popovers were good, but not sure they live up to the hype. If you have a clear night, drive back into the park to see an amazing amount of stars and part of the Milky Way. We drove to Bass Harbor to see a sunset along with the hundreds of others trying to get a good picture. If you do this, you have to get there at least an hour before sunset or more. Parking is crazy there and in popular points along Loop road, which is one way traffic in most of it. We saw some tide pools at Schooner Head Trail, but didn't see much, except a few things in the anemone cave, which has to be visited at low tide only and is very slippery. I highly recommend taking some sort of boat tour to see the islands from the water as well as spending a half day to shop around Bar Harbor.

Acadia National Park,Loved every second. Will return but NOT go on weekend or Columbus day again as too many cars and people. We enjoyed hiking from Sand Beach to Otter Point. Views were fabulous and took lots of the side paths. Suggest good hiking shoes because of rocks and tree limbs sticking out of ground. Also enjoyed wandering around the top of Cadillac Mountain.

We did, however, drive the park loop and pulled off to take some photos of the fall colors. We also went to Cadillac Mountain to see the sunrise, and it was very crowded; however, people were very respectful, and it was cool cheering with the masses as the sun peaked over the horizon across the Atlantic Ocean.

The only way to see those views are hiking up there. There are easier trails and harder trails, and did not know which one was which until we had taken the hardest one up and spoke with a park ranger when we reached the summit of Beech Mt.

We always used an app to find driving routes and parking and started by 9am. We were rarely on the loop road and always got parking in a designated area. One day we did a point to point and took the free shuttle back to our car. We had a National parks pass or you can stop at the visitors center to buy a pass.We hiked all difficulties of trails and had an amazing experience! There is an excellent waterproof trails map I got online that was also for sale at the visitors center. There were restrooms at several trailheads that were well maintained.

It must be hard for the driver to enjoy the views on the way since it is such a windy road It was beautiful for the Jordan Pond hike. Perfect temps and not windy. It was a moderate hike because at one point it was through some rocks. I didn't love the wooden trail, but the rocks and regular trails were great.

We were there at the very end of September and I enjoyed the fact that there were less people around.,"October 5, 2018",Majestic!,60,Pocatello,5

Acadia National Park,First time at this park. Bucket list trip. It was everything I imagined and more! So beautiful and peaceful. We arrived to the park late evening as the sun was setting.

Acadia National Park,"We drove up to Cadillac mountain for sunrise and were surprised to find many cars there, even though we were there a half hour before the sunrise.The traffic and crowd was worth it for a spectacular sunrise!We then spent the rest of the day visiting the park by doing the loop drive and hiking several of it's trails.","October 5, 2018",Sunrise on Cadillac Mountain,27,"Stuart, Florida",5
Acadia National Park,"We've been to a lot of national parks and I would rate this one of the highest out of all the parks we've been too. So many vistas, so many spectacular coastal views. The carriage road trails were fantastic if you like hiking but want more level ground to walk on (they parallel all the hiking trails which are a bit more difficult and more for the surefooted and experienced hiker). The iconic waterfall bridge is a must see (especially for photographers). Eagle lake carriage road trail is also spectacular. Cadillac mountain views are incredible, but the place is always busy and parking is difficult (I hear in the morning at sunrise you can't even get a space to park up there). Try to get out to most stops early (before 10AM to those places you really want to see). We went in the first week of October and the colors were starting to change already (this is the last week you really want to come to Nova Scotia/Maine) as many attractions and restaurants/hotels start to close down (especially in the Maritimes). The weather was little cool but it was worth not having to buck the summer crowds. Many of the overlooks are right on the 27 mile loop and everything is pretty easy to find (but I would recommend getting some detailed information and maps on the trails so you know where you are going beforehand). Some of the trails are not well marked in terms of destinations (you won't see a sign for the waterfall bridge). So get your maps and do your homework and planning before coming to the park to make get the most out of it. Its definitely worth the trip. One last hint: they have been working on some road construction in Bar Harbor so ask your hotel if they are affected by the construction. We stayed at the Atlantic Oceanside hotel which was in the middle of a one way 6 mile loop that you had to travel on to go downtown (which was very close). Some hotels are more conveniently located in relation to the construction. Anyway, this park is really worth the visit and reminds me how beautiful are own country really is!","October 5, 2018",3 days in Acadia and could have stayed longer!,6,"Parkland, Florida",5
Acadia National Park,"My husband and I traveled all around Acadia National Park; Park Loop Road, Cadillac Summit Road/Cadillac Mountain Trail, as well as several of the amazing trails (Flying Mountain Trail, Great Head Trail), and more. We spent a full day there, but could easily have spent a week there exploring all the park had to offer. The trails were amazing - the sights, the smells, the sounds - it was incredible every single direction you turned! (Not to mention, we found it really helpful that they mark the trails with small blue lines of paint so you know you're staying on the trail...there are a lot of small paths that lead off of the main path.) And, to make things even BETTER, we happened to go on one of the Free Fee Days! We absolutely LOVED our time in Acadia National Park.","October 4, 2018",Amazing Place,69,"Middleton, WI",5
Acadia National Park,"Okay, so I have only been to three national parks in my lifetime, Grand Teton, Yellowstone, and Acadia. Though they are all very different, I have to say my favorite is Acadia. Why do you ask? It is due to the ease at which I can reach it (FREE bus), the quality of the hiking (maintenance of trails as well as variety in difficulty levels, and terrain). It is such a relaxed atmosphere as well. Though I visited during high season, and there were A LOT of people there, you could always find a trail to wonder on your own, mediate, take in the beauty, be one with nature. I traveled alone (female) and it felt safe and I had the option to be with the crowd or not. It was a great way to reset and so easy to travel into the park each day. If you think it is just another national park, and a small one at that, you are missing out.","October 4, 2018",Amazing National Park!,35,"St. Petersburg, Florida",5
Acadia National Park,"This was our first visit to Acadia and we loved it. Best thing was the hiking. Many of the trails provide a challenge, especially The Precipice and The Beehive, for out of shape 50-somethings like us, but are not so long that they take all day. And then you are rewarded with spectacular views of the bay and islands. Cadillac Mtn at sunrise is a must, well worth the effort to get up early. I would hate to go in the summer though. Better to go in the fall like we did to avoid all the congestion.","October 4, 2018",Great place to hike and see great views!,4,"Cincinnati, United States",5

It doesn't matter if you get there for sunrise, sunset or mid-day ... it's gorgeous. Beautiful view of the ocean, islands, boats and park. I haven't experienced sunrise there yet, or hiked it, but hope to do both some day. If you are in the Bar Harbor area, it's a must-see. The only drawback is that it gets crowded so pack your patience and enjoy!","October 3, 2018",LOVE this park!,36,"Marlborough, Massachusetts",5

Acadia National Park,Acadia is absolutely stunning. There are so many different trails. One of the best things is that the trails are rated by difficulty so you can decide which trails to take based on your ability. I went in September after school was in session but before the leaves turn and the park was still crowded. Parking was sometimes a challenge but it made me walk more. I love that you can do the ocean walk as well as the forest walk. ,"October 3, 2018",Fall hike,0,"Carrollton, Texas",4

Acadia National Park,The park is absolutely lovely in the fall but I imagine all year round it's worth the visit. It's not as well marked as other parks but it's not difficult to find your way. Several of the trails were very rocky so having a walking stick can be helpful so it's easier to keep your footing when they are loose/wet. The views over the water are delightful and it's a pretty easy hike in most places.,"October 3, 2018",Gorgeous for fall colors!,100,"Franklin, Tennessee",4

We spent about three days in the area and managed to see a lot -- even though there was a lot of fog most of the time we were there. We took a tour bus through the park the first morning to get an overview and see the key sites -- Thunder Hole, the Jordan Pond House and Cadillac Mountain. And then we took the free buses from downtown Bar Harbor or drove into the park at other points to spend more time exploring. It's a beautiful place and not to be missed.","October 2, 2018",Check this one off my bucket list,2,"Columbus, Ohio",5

The interstate is not that scenic, but the faster of the two routes. I'd love to go back and drive route 1 up there. Anyway, the park is gorgeous. The highlight for me was Beehive trail, which is quickly accessible from the main beach. The trail is challenging, and not for all, but full of stark ladders and breathtaking views. It was a quick, but exhilarating hike up, and perfect for those who only have a short time. I can't wait to get back to this park. ","October 2, 2018",Wonderful Park,5,,5
Acadia National Park,"Spent three nights in Bar Harbor at one of the B&B's (Asygarth Station, reviewed elsewhere). Absolutely astonished at the beauty and grandeur of the park, a true natural treasure to be preserved forever. I won't cover the more popular sites (Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole, Sand Beach, etc. other to say that they are worth the visit). Jordan Pond however blew me away. Hiked the trail the first day in the fog, couldn't see more than 100' in any direction and it was a lovely hike. Returned the next day in clear, sunny conditions and just the view from the meadow looking out to the Bubbles is worth the trip. As many people have said, go early to get good parking spots and to avoid the crowds. We were there late September and when the cruise ships come in, the sheer number of people can be over whelming. Did several hikes, stop at the Visitors Center and get a topographical map for $5 if you intend to hike any of the trails to get a really good idea of what your in for. Be careful when looking at the reviews on the trails as some of them aren't very accurate. We hike Hadlock Brook Trail which is a difficult stone and root strewn trail which someone had miss labeled as the Hadlock Carriage trail, so be thorough and know your trails.","October 2, 2018",Wonderful gift of nature and scenic grandeur!,10,"New Philadelphia, Ohio",5

Acadia National Park,"We re-visited Acadia Park on our visit to Bar Harbor. We spent two days at the park - on the first day we started at Sand Beach and walked to Thunder Hole. On the second day we walked part-way around Eagle Lake on the carriage road. Both walks were wonderful; the first had fantastic ocean scenery, the second was much more quiet and peaceful. We parked at the top end of Echo lake where there are toilets. Drives through the park are also lovely; most roads are one-way with two lane travel, making stopping or passing very easy. The only down-side are the large number of tour buses on the ocean route, mostly stopping at Thunder Hole.","October 2, 2018","Great place for walking, hiking, biking, even driving",65,"Rockport, Massachusetts",5

The scenic loop has a lot of beautiful views, places to stop and admire the scenery. Cadillac Mountain is definitely worth the drive.

Acadia National Park,"The morning sunrise was beautiful. Seeing all the people there watching the sun come up on top of this hill was pretty cool. Cold and early. I definitely like the sunset at Key West better but sill this was nice, glad I did it. Wouldn't do it again. Signage in this expensive national park is moderate to poor, bathrooms are the visitors center are inside and it doesn't open till 8 so if you show up at 5 for the sunrise event don't go to the visitor's center. I know this park is listed as one of the top national parks I don't know why. Saw racoons and turkeys. We were lucky with good weather and great visibility. One person up at the morning sunrise event said this was his 3rd this week and the first with good weather conditions. At the top of the mountain the view of Bar Harbor is nice but you are so far away it is mostly dots on the camera. We visited Mt Battie two days ago. I think the views and pictures were better the admission was $12 for two including a car, at Acadia the admission is $30 for the car and $15 for each person - $60 total. For that amount of money I'd expect good signage and bathrooms open during big demand periods. ","September 23, 2018",It's a bucket list park,1,"Chalfont, Pennsylvania",4

Acadia National Park,"So, if you are looking for picture perfect green and water, you've hit the jackpot.If you are more into nature amazing creations, not it.As always, started at the visitor's center. Have entered through Hulls Cove.You park and need to go upstairs to the place itself in order to get a park permit, if you are not holding an annual one.Nice and smiley ranger was there, but the most unhelpful one I have encountered till today.The first thing you should know about the park, is that the trails are entwined into one another and you can make short ones, or longer as you see fit, which is awesome and this most important detail was known to me only when I was actually trekking.As for the list of trails, it isn't freely given with the map like other parks, you have to purchase it. I don't know what's on it, since I have relied on ""All Trails Pro"" which in hindsight, wasn't very useful either.You can see in the pics an example to how the trails are built.As for Camping, I went to the closer site, Blackwoods Campground, which is reviewed separately.First day I have parked in Sand Beach and went on the Ocean Path, which is more of a stroll, with niches to get very nice views of the ocean and Sand Beach, finished at Otter Cliffs and went back to the Gorham Mountain trailhead.At this point you can see how some trails can be combined.I have made the trail into a loop, that landed me back close to Sand Beach where my car was parked.Just follow the signs you want. You can't really get lost.Most of the trail is rocky and I would categorize it as moderate to easy. Back to Sand Beach and down the stairs to Great Head Trail.You cross the beach and there's a small U turn at the Beehive lake.You can loop that too. The way up is a little bit more challenging, the way down if you loop it, is easy.All the trails took me about 5 hours.Second day Jordan Pond.Take a right after a pretty boring mile and you have interesting trails - Bubble Rock, Eagle Lake. Uphill, some rocky. The north Bubble Summit is beautiful.Eagle lake not as much.The trails don't loop and I came out from the point I have entered.Then about 2 more miles back to the parking lot, around the pond.This way is a bit more challenging if you are just looking for a stroll.This has taken me about 4 hours and added up to about 7 miles.***wear proper shoes for Trekking***if you have T-mobile, there's no internet connection. It connects to AT&T and it's calls only. Highly recommend a drive through the island with the car.The park boundaries are blurred, so there's food, drinks and everything you want, just a little drive away. This is off season, so accommodation is easy to find in all price ranges.Trenton has a very cozy picnic area, with toilets, picnic table and a nice view.Have Fun","September 22, 2018","Not my top choice for national parks, but still something to be said",65,"Los Angeles, California",3
Acadia National Park,"This, to me, was a very small, urbanized national park. I really liked the busses inside the park. I'd also say this has to be the most dog friendly national park I have been to. The only negative is this park is also almost completely surrounded by houses, and it makes it hard to feel isolated, and it's just sad for the wildlife, they can't really come and go freely.I'd say if you want a vacation with your dog, with great restaurants, little shops, lots of history, and short hikes, this is the park for you.","September 22, 2018",Neat little park,26,"Las Vegas, NV",4

Let them do the driving so you can enjoy more of the park. Parking spaces are also a premium inside the park. My favorite memory is stopping at Sand Beach and then walking the trial to Thunder Roll. It’s about two miles and easy. If you are a picture taker like I am, it might take you awhile. Breathtaking views, It will not disappoint. ","September 20, 2018",A National Treasure,1,,5

Acadia National Park,This is a gorgeous park with vistas that are beyond words. It would take several days to experience even a fraction of its vastness. Unfortunately crowds of people are very close to ruining the splendor. The park service recommends taking the free bus. Great idea. Even in the “off season”there are very few parking spaces. You will find yourself spending most of you time circling the lot in search of a spot. Take food and water with you. Once you pass the gates there is nowhere to buy anything except Jordan Pond and very limited parking there.

You can bike or drive all over it too but be warned if you bike, it's very hilly. Parking can be a challenge and we visited on a very busy week but with a bit of patience, we were able to park everywhere we wanted as cars are always coming and going. You can also take the free bus from Bar Harbor and hop on or off. We are Floridians (aka flatlanders) in our 60's but we enjoyed the shoreline hike and the Jordan Pond hike, both relatively flat and just beautiful! Plan ahead and make reservations at the Pond House after your hike! We challenged ourselves with the Great Head Trail, a lot of which is uphill over boulders. It was hard for us but SO worth it! Do it if you're able. There are tons of others of varying intensity and at least drive up Cadillac Mountain for the views.

Acadia National Park,"Our family of four (boys ages 12 and 14) spent two days exploring the park; wish we had allotted at least one more day to be able to see a bit more. The first night we arrived, we did the two mile loop hike from Bubbles parking lot (we were able to get a parking space at 5:45 pm) using Split Bubble trail to Jordan Pond Shore Trail to South Bubble Trail, including the spur to see Bubble rock - this took us a little under two hours with lots of picture stops and time to skip rocks in Jordan Pond. Saw a beaver dam and the swimming beaver in Jordan Pond. The next day we drove to the summit of Cadillac Mountain for sunrise (it gets crowded, so suggest arriving at least 45 minutes before official sunrise time to get closer parking and to find a good spot to watch). Hang out for a bit after sunrise to enjoy the view and let some of the traffic get off the mountain. Then, we did the 1 mile Bar Island trail out and back and spent some time skipping rocks and exploring the tide pools at low tide from downtown Bar Harbor (check the tide tables, as you can only go to Bar Island for the three hours centered around a low tide). The last day, we got to Sand Beach parking at 8:30 am (the lot was full around 8:45 am) and did approximately a five mile loop starting on Bowl Trail to Gorham Mountain Trial to Shore Trail (out to Otter Cliffs then back to Sand Beach). This took about 3:15 hours, with several stops for drinking water, taking pictures, scrambling on the rocks, watching Thunder Hole, watching rappelling, and admiring the views of Sand Beach, Otter Cliffs and the surrounding areas from the top of the mountain. When we arrived back at Sand Beach at Noon, parking stretched along the road for a long way. We changed into bathing suits and enjoyed the beach and had snacks. The water is beautiful but cold, probably 60 degrees. There is not much shade near the beach. The beach does have changing rooms, bathrooms, water fountain, water bottle filling station, and foot rinsing. We then continued along Park Loop Road to Jordan Pond house, but after several passes were unable to get a parking space, so decided to head off the loop along Route 3 to see the gatehouse, then parked in the Upper Hadlock Pond parking lot and did about a 2 mile hike along two carriage roads (intersections 12 and 13) connected by a hiking path, seeing 3 bridges and a small waterfall. There were carriage road maps at the information kiosk at the parking lot. Be aware that there is no cell signal at Jordan Pond House - we got separated while our driver looked for parking, so had no way to communicate when to reconnect. But, we did have signal in most of the other areas of the park. We used the REI app on our hikes, and we had purchased a hiking book that we used to decide which hikes to do. We also visited Hulls Cove Visitor Center to get our passport stamps, visit the gift shop, and get information - very helpful staff there. We had pre-purchased our 7 day park pass ($30 for a vehicle) online before our arrival, which proved useful since we arrived at ANP after the Thompson Island Information Center had closed (5:00 pm). Note that if you are going through Freeport on your way to Arcadia, the LLBean store sells the park passes. We spent three nights in Bar Harbor at the Villager Motel (good location and value compared to other Bar Harbor Hotels) and spent time exploring Bar Harbor - eating at Blaze, Jordan's, Rosalie's, and the Side Street Cafe plus multiple visits to CJs Big Dipper Ice Cream. We enjoyed the July 4th parade and fireworks in Bar Harbor. The only tour we did during our visit was Diver Ed's Dive In Theater from Bar Harbor, which we highly recommend especially if you are traveling with elementary school kids.","September 15, 2018","Rugged coastline, beautiful lakes, nice hiking, gorgeous sunrise",207,Maryland,5
Acadia National Park,"The trick to Acadia is to figure out where to park outside the park to get to the trails you want to get to inside the park. We purchased the week pass ahead of time but when we got to the park it was just way too crowded and not enough parking - this was a week after labor day - so hate to see what it is like in the Summer. Then we bought a little guide book that showed where all the trails were, how they were connected and where to park outside the park. There is a tremendous range of hiking from very easy carriage roads for long easy walks (or bike rides) to very steep climbing paths. The scenery of course is beautiful - and Cadillac Mountain view does not disappoint. Would to have liked to see some Eagles or more animals/birds in general. Turns out you need to take a nature cruise to some of the islands to see that.","September 15, 2018",Beautiful place - great for hiking,97,"Breckenridge, Colorado",4

Hiking, biking, site seeing, boat tours, whale watching, great road side stops to eat. Weather is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this area.

That is not very eco-friendly because of the extra petrol you are using and the carbon footprint. The ticket for the park cost 30 dollars and is valid for a week. There is not an option for a day or two ticket and the tickets allows you to do the brown circuit of the sandy beach and Mount Desert Island. For the rest of the park you do not need a ticket. all in all is expensive in comparison with the White Mountain National Park whose ticket only cost 5 dollars and is equally beautiful.

Acadia National Park," During a week in September, Acadia National Park & Bar Harbor, Maine host a Night Sky Festival. It's truly a wonderful event for any wannabe astronomers out there. There's lectures at local venues by astronauts, astronomers & professors to inform on our universe. Take a trip out by catamaran to view the night sky while learning the location planets & constellations by a narrator. There's a well orchestrated trip up to Cadillac Mountain where, thanks to Maine's commitment to reducing light pollution, one can see our vast Milky Way splayed out across the night sky. They set up approximately 50-70 telescopes focused on planets, star clusters, the Andromeda galaxy & other spectacular astronomical landmarks. I highly recommend this outing to anyone who wants to learn more about space! ","September 9, 2018",Night Sky Festival ,14,"Boston, MA ",5
Acadia National Park,"If half-points were allowed I'd give this 4.5, as I prefer the desert parks more. Yet this is a fabulous, beautiful place and easy to navigate. Parking's a bit tight in spots, but otherwise we never felt overcrowded. Can't beat the price (about $20 for a 1-week pass). Trails are clearly marked, and run the gamut from Beehive Trail (very steep, technical climbing, some ladders along cliff-sides -- not for the faint of heights) to Bubble Rock (the north one's better for views) to Ocean Path (easy). Unfortunately, conditions were still and made Thunder Hole a relative flop, but I imagine it's a lot cooler to see with some turbulent weather conditions/winds. Views from Cadillac Mountain are pretty, and easy to get to by car. In all, I'd say 2 full days is enough to experience most of the trails. Park's not overwhelmingly big. If you don't hike at all, 1 day is probably enough to drive the car loop and see the key attractions.","September 9, 2018","Beautiful scenery, hiking for all skill levels",17,Tinton Falls,5

I wish we would have booked all five nights near the park. It was gorgeous. We visited Cadillac Mountain twice, once at sunset and once after sunset. The views are spectacular if not a little scary! You can walk all over and up and down the mountain if you wanted to. There is a handicap accessible trail as well which I loved so that everyone could get the full experience of the park. You can drive straight to the top which makes it a lot easier for us inexperienced hikers. We drove the Park Loop Road and stopped a few times at Jordan's Pond, Eagle Lake, and a few other places. We also walked one of the paths along the ocean near Bar Harbor for a wonderful relaxing time under the shade, watching the waves and the boats.

Acadia National Park,When you purchase a park pass in town it includes free shuttles to this beautiful park. We chose to do the Ocean Trail hike/walk. Happy we took the shuttle driver’s advice and started at Otter Point and ended at Sand Beach which is busier and has facilities. It is an easy walk with amazing scenery. There are numerous places to go off trail and explore the rocky coastline. Nice option for a picnic but of course be safe.,"September 5, 2018",Rocky beauty ,10,Canada,5
Acadia National Park,"We drove over 1000 miles with trailer/kayak in tow, with the intention of kayaking/fishing in the park. The pros: Only one. It is absolutely beautiful. The cons: There is only 1 Visitor Center, which you have to climb to get to. The gift shop area is the smallest I've ever seen. It's 90% books, no shot glasses(which I collect) & 1 choice of t-shirt. No hat/t-shirt combo like at all the other NP'S. They could generate so much revenue if they'd expand this area & offer more choices. So now we're driving on the Loop & come to the Sand Beach Entrance Station. 3 booths are open. We had already tackled the climb to get our pass, but had to sit in line behind people purchasing theirs & asking questions. Would it kill them to make one of those lines an Express, for those who already have their pass??? There is absolutely no other Ranger presence in the park, except at entrances. On the entire 27 miles of Loop Road, there are only TWO picnic areas. Parking is a NIGHTMARE! They do warn you & advise you to use their bus system. If we didn't have plans of kayaking, we would of utilized the shuttle buses. We had put the kayak on our car & left the trailer at the campground, just for that reason. Our first attempt was at the boat launch at Jordan Pond. We drove through the parking lot twice. It was very clear that most of the ""launch"" parking spots were filled with non boaters/kayakers. So we continued on. We found the same situation at Eagle Lake, even though it states NO SWIMMING, that is who was bogarting all the parking spots. We finally were able to find a parking spot at the launch at Echo Lake, but had to park & carry to the water. Dodging all the swimmers was a nightmare. even though the brochure states it was ""closed to swimming and wading"", there was no one there to enforce this. We gave up even trying at the others. We're glad we went. Got some beautiful pictures of the coast & crossed Acadia off our National Park list, BUT we will never go back.","September 5, 2018","Views were a amazing...park it self, very disappointing",8,"Detroit, Michigan",3

For a less scary buy still strenuous hike I recommend the Gormund trail to the bowl and die through the Cadillac cliffs. And for an easy or family friendly stroll I recommend Jordan Pond, Bar Island, and Wonderland Trail. There is literally something for everyone here. Don’t miss watching the sun rise over Cadillac Mountain or star gazing from Ocean Drive.

The Granite Museum is in an old building but the inside had dioramas, tools, and photos of the early granite quarry operations. The guide was very knowledgeable and interesting. Of course Cadillac Mountain, Bubble Mountain rock, Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond, Sand Beach, and Otter Cliffs were all beautiful. I think the Jordan Pond Restaurant is a little overrated. Their service was poor and had an overpriced menu. You can get the same famous ""popover"" roll in a nearby Southwest Harbor restaurant at half the price.

We also got to walk on Sand Beach, and we found a perfect mussel shell that we will make an ornament out of. Thunder hole wasn't ""thundering"" when we got there, but still pretty neat. The Jordan Pond thing seems a bit over-crowded & over-rated, hundreds & hundreds of people wanting to eat scones? No thanks. Get out and explore, we covered pretty much the whole island, all the way down to Bass Harbor. The town of Bar Harbor itself was a disappointment. NO WHERE to park. Forget it.

Acadia National Park,"We visited Arcadia National Park in August and spent 3 nights at the Coach Stop B&B nearby (a good location). The park is easy to get to and the loop drive takes you around the entire park in a good orientation (with lots of places to pull over). I recommend going to the visitor's center for advice on the best way to see it. So here are some hints to enjoy the park. We wanted to walk the coastal trail along the rocks etc. and parked in the Otter point parking lot and walked the 2.5 miles along the incredibly beautiful trail to the Sandy Beach. where we got a bus to take us back. Lunch was at the Jordon Pond house (with their famous popovers) and then we walked on some of the magnificent carriage roads through woods that were created by Rockefeller and donated to the park. Cadillac mountain is also a must for the view. In all honesty, one of my favorite places was not in the main part of the park, but on the ""quiet side"" of the island near Bass Harbor. Not only is there a very picturesque lighthouse there, but there are two walks (we took the Ship Harbor trail) to take from the parking area, through woods that come out to the ocean and wonderful rocks. The views are just lovely, the rocks are a little flatter than in the main park and there are tidal pools (at low tide) that have all kinds of things to see. A good place for a picnic too. (Carry in/out). When we were there, there were lots of kids enjoying them. That ""side"" of the island is less ""commercial"" with small New England towns and lots of places to eat.

Acadia National Park,"We were there in the middle of August. I think September would have been better when vacations were over. On our first full day (a Saturday) the weather was cloudy with on and off rain. This definitely kept the crowds down and we didn't have any problems navigating the park. However, from the top of Cadillac Mountain, the view was misty. We climbed up to South Bubble Rock -- about a 1/2f mile hike. It was moderately strenuous. We also went to Jordan's Pond which was lovely and we had lunch at the restaurant overlooking the water (see separate review). We went to the Wild Gardens of Acadia. I thought we would see flowers, but it was mainly green plants. We didn't spend much time there.The next day it was sunny. We got up early and went to the top of Cadillac Mountain again and the view was much better although still a little misty. We got there at 8:30am and there was plenty of parking. By 10:00 the park was filling up. We went back to Jordan's Pond for lunch but couldn't find a parking space in either lot. On the cloudy day before there were plenty of them. So, we then went to Sand Beach -- crowded but we found a space. We walked around on the huge rocks and took in the scenery. It was fun.Even though Acadia can't compare with the awesome and magnificent parks out west, it was still a worthwhile visit. But don't go in July or August.

Acadia National Park,"A lot to see and do here for outdoor enthusiasts. First, you get a 1 week park pass costing $30 per car at one of the ranger stations or several other locations that sell them. In addition to hiking the many miles of trails in Acadia, we hiked and rode bikes on the miles of carriage roads in the park. There is too much excellent scenery to list here, but the best views are offered from on top of Cadillac Mountain as well as the coastal trail from Sand Beach to Otter Point passing Thunder Hole. Hiking around Jordan Pond is an excellent hike with great pond views and I recommend eating a popover at the Jordan Pond House, which we did. I recommend going early in order to find parking spaces as they fill up quickly later in the morning. We hiked or biked every day except on a rainy day when we visited the Dorr and Abbe Museums as well as the Bar Harbor Historical Society Museum - all in Bar Harbor. They are small, but good museums. There is no swimming allowed in any of the park's fresh water ponds, but swimming is allowed at Sand Beach, if you can withstand the ocean's cold water temps. Also, we walked out to Bar Island and walked the trail which you can only do during low tides. As a result, there are signs telling visitors of when the low and high tides are coming during the month. Outside of the park, you can take boat rides to Baker Island to see the lighthouse or out to Little Cranberry Island, which we did from Northeast harbor. This tour was excellent, informative and we got to visit the Islesford Museum on the island. Overall, it's a great way to spend a vacation and if you can you should definitely visit this great park.","August 27, 2018",Outdoor adventure for all ages,6,,5

In addition to being awed by our surroundings, we were impressed by the many friendly travelers we interacted with. It was great to see families with young children and seniors hiking. While some trails are gravel-based, the island is rocky, and you will have to navigate stones in many areas. Popular trails are well-maintained and some trailheads have bathrooms and fountains to replenish water bottles. The only restaurant is at Jordon Pond and the popovers are legendary. Popover: airy biscuit eaten with butter and jam. Shuttle buses fill up quickly and individuals stand in the aisles as well. Sometimes we were lucky with timing, and during one visit endured an extra hour of travel due to waiting. This park has mountains, lakes, carriage trail rides, and areas to bike-ride and explore.

Acadia National Park,"Had a great few days in Acadia! Maine has friendly people, natural beauty, and Acadia offers a unique blend of the mountains and ocean. We actually stayed in Ellsworth (Hampton Inn was a thumbs up) which was also less expensive than the name hotels on the island. But Ellsworth is about 25 mins away from the island. The view from Cadillac mountain is majestic and there are nice running trails (especially the Ocean View trail that starts at Sand Beach and goes aside the Park Loop road to Otters Point) for a morning run. Sand beach is a small beach area where we sat on the rocks and beach but did not enter the water (a little cool for me). However, there were many brave souls swimming and playing in the water. Changing rooms are available if you choose to swim. Sieur de Monts was also a place we visited. Carriage roads around Jordan Pond house are worth checking out but I would not recommend eating at Jordan Pond House except for the popovers. Food was poor and service was even worse. Better eating options on the island are Adelman’s Deli, West Street Café and CJ’s ice cream. Also, Lobster Pound and Real Pit BBQ is a good BBQ place on the side of the road from Bar Harbor and Elllsworth. We were not able to go kayaking as we didn’t plan in advance—so book early. Would also recommend the Atlantic Brewing Company for a 30 min tour plus sampling—this is also a good option when it is raining. On our way back we stopped over for a night in Portsmouth, NH—historical town and good eating options by the river. In sum, we had fun and I would visit Acadia again!","August 22, 2018",Acadia National Park,9,"Suwanee, Georgia",5

Acadia National Park,"Our family of four spent 2 wonderful days in Acadia. We drove the Park Loop Road twice and saw pretty much everything we wanted to see. Here is a summary of the sights:1) Cadillac Mountain. This is a must-see, but it's VERY crowded at sunrise and sunset. The beauty of sunrise can often be hampered by too much clouds, as we experienced. If you come during daytime hours, try to come early in the morning (before 10 am). Otherwise it gets crowded on the summit and difficult to find parking. Views from the top are beautiful and expansive, but can be a bit hazy.2) Sieur de Monts. Small nature center and a small but well-maintained garden with a good variety of native plants.2) Sand Beach. A pretty beach, but again it gets VERY crowded after 9-10 am. Water is cold. If you have a couple of hours, we recommend hiking the Great Head Trail for amazing views.3) Thunder Hole. A fun stop along the Park Loop Road. Best if you come during high tide to experience the ""thunder"" effect.4) Fabbri A good place to eat a picnic lunch in the park. There are two dozens picnic tables under the trees (yay for shade!). Restrooms and water fountains available.5) Jordan Pond House. Nice restaurant and large gift shop, but it doesn't give much of a view of Jordan Pond itself.We recommend visiting Bass Harbor Lighthouse Head at the southern end of Mount Desert Island. It is not located in the park, but it is worth the short drive. Be sure to walk the short trail to the rocks below, and then walk onto the rocks, to get the best view of the lighthouse. Afternoon lighting is best.If you have 3-4 hours to spare, Schoodic Peninsula is also worth a visit. It is an hour away and not crowded at all. Frazer Point is beautiful, peaceful, and has picnic tables. Schoodic Point has a wide expanse of rocks/slabs jutting out to the ocean, where you can watch ocean waves crashing onto the rocks.Downtown Bar Harbor: It's a busy little beach town.

A few good things to know is that they have daily rates for entry or a weekly rate. Seniors are better off to get a lifetime pass.

Acadia National Park,"Acadia national Park offers an array of activities to visitors: sightseeing, hiking, water activities, and nature education. The view from Cadillac Mountain is breathtaking. Make sure at some point to take the drive on the grand loop - much of which is one way. Many hike portions of this stretch, however know that the hiking trail for much of it is right next to the road. The Sand Beach area is indeed what it says: it is a sand beach which could be a great place to sit in the sun and go into the cold water. When we were there many families took advantage of this. If you don’t want to sit in the sun or go in the water you you probably want to continue on. If time permits try to stop at Jordan Pond which is more like a lake. You can hike around it or go canoeing, etc. but no swimming. Jordan Pond House is also a fun place to have lunch, especially in the outdoors area. I imagine that one’s experience of the park will vary according to the weather. Luckily, it didn’t rain for us, but it wasn’t very sunny which affected the color of the water and the trees. During the summer months, be prepared for scores of other visitors to join you in sightseeing at the park.

The second day we went to the top mountain to see the sunrise--absolutely beautiful! (and crowded with probably 1000 people). Revisited the beach area and did some more hiking.

Acadia National Park,"Nice place to go with the family. Please map out your paths accordingly ahead of time. Some paths can be quite challenging and strenuous. If you want to take a nature stroll, I would suggest the yellow trails. Yellow trails (paths) are the least strenuous, and allow you to really walk at your ow pace to really look at everything. On the other hand, if you like challenges choose the red paths (trails). Bring plenty of water and bug spray! Nice activity to do with yourself, family, and friends.

Thunder hole - all in the Eastern Side of Desert Mountain Island / Acadia National Park.Thunder hole - do come about 2 hours before the high tide - otherwise it is just a nice formation of rocks.

It is an extremely beautiful park with many great hiking trails and areas to sit and enjoy the beauty of nature. Plenty of areas to pack a picnic lunch. There is a sandy beach for those that enjoy hanging out at the beach. While we did not get a chance, there are some nice dedicated biking trails (no vehicles allowed) and areas to kayak. The area reminded me of the Carmel/Monterey coastline in California with water, granite and beautiful trees.

It's everything it's cracked up to be - wonderful scenery, lots of hiking and camping options and free buses that transport you from Bar Harbor to multiple destinations inside the Park. If we return it won't be at the peak of the summer season - Acadia was very crowded and the visitor's center was jammed.

Acadia National Park,"I have nothing but positive things to say about Acadia. The website was a relatively easy place to start when planning my trip, planning my hikes, routes, purchasing my pass in advance and getting updates on road/trail closures.While in the park, the park staff/rangers were helpful, very informative and appeared to truly enjoy their jobs. The park is well maintained, it's kept very clean and most of the trails and preservation areas are well marked. Some of the trail names don't align with the map, but the maps are very accurate so it's not too difficult to tell the difference. I recommend getting reading up on the trails prior to your trip. Some trail parking lots fill up very quick (e.g., sand beach, precipe trail, jordan trail, etc.) so plan accordingly. The park offers 360 degree views of island and surrounding water and islands. The views are absolutely spectacular. While we only saw a sunset, there are locations you can get unobstructed views. The park has an abundance of wild blueberries growing throughout. The berries are small, but sweet. Just pay attention and make sure it's a blueberry and not another berry. There is a good amount of wildlife throughout as well. We saw a garder snake, deer, many birds, some fish, etc. A word of wisdom, where bug spray. There are lots of mosquitoes and supposedly ticks. We didn't find any, but then again, we did use bug spray with deet.","August 7, 2018",Great Hiking and Wonderful Park Service,89,"Pottstown, Pennsylvania",5
Acadia National Park,"We went to Acadia with some recommendations from friends but mostly just a willingness to explore and see what was being offered.We went to the night sky talk on Sand Beach with the rangers even though it was a foggy night. It takes place on Wednesday and Saturday nights at 9 pm. I'm sure it is an amazing experience on a clear night but we still enjoyed learning about the names of all the moons of the year since a new moon had just occurred.We also loved exploring Cadillac Mountain and our kids did the Junior Ranger Challenge. Both were sworn in and awarded their Junior Ranger badges/patches. We also watched a sunset from on top of Cadillac Mountain and then stayed a while longer to stargaze. My kids saw constellations and satellites that they had never seen before and I saw Mars, which I had never been able to pick out before.We also loved looking at all the little critters in the tide pools at Thunder Hole (e.g. crabs, tadpoles, snails and barnacles.) The ""thunder"" wasn't quite what we expected but it was still interesting.I would highly recommend this park to anyone. It was beautiful!","August 7, 2018",Beautiful park and great activities for everyone,20,,5

Acadia National Park,"We visited Maine for the first time this summer driving up from Boston. We booked into a 2-night stay at Camden and we went to Bar Harbor on our second day. Although the weather was overcast with drizzles from time to time, we decided that we would visit the Arcadia National Park. The park was really easy to get to (by car) and the entrance fee was $30 per vehicle (at our time of visit). Once you are there, you just need to follow the Park Loop Road to get to all the scenic points.We first stopped at Thunder Hole - where one would hear sounds of thunders when the waves pound into the cove. Unfortunately for us, the best time to hear that would be during high tide (apparently), which wasn’t the case when we visited. Next we stopped at Otter Cove - again, not the time of the year (I guess), we only managed to see a couple of seagulls. Feeling a little peckish, we then drove to Jordan Pond House for tea and tried their famous Popover - that was really yummy and did not disappoint. Afterwards, we took a quick walk round the pond. We never made it one round as we wanted to go up Cadillac Mountain - as it was supposed to have the best view at dusk. However, given the weather on our day of visit, this was definitely a mistake. We could hardly see anything beyond 20 feet driving up the mountain due to the heavy mist. As it was getting late, we finally gave up after about 20 minutes, it just wasn’t to be. Nonetheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the National Park, eventhough the weather was not ideal, it was well worth a visit. Highly recommended.","August 7, 2018",Worth a visit during any kind of weather,13,"Hong Kong, Hong Kong",5

In that case there is bus service available. We did not do boat rides but heard good things from my friends who went at the same time that the dolphin watch cruise was great.

Acadia National Park,I wish I had understood that the main park loop is one way. This can be a challenge if you don’t plan ahead. We explored the entire west side of my desert island in one day. Beautiful by bass harbor and don’t miss the sea wall. Beautiful roadside access. The lighthouse had a tiny parking lot so we didn’t get a spot to see that. Maybe 10-12 parking spaces? Got to Cadillac Mountain by 9 am and had no trouble parking but by 10 when we left lot was full. Beautiful hiking and scenery up there. We were fortunate to be up there on a clear day. Also enjoyed Jordan pond but was busy and hard to park and get pictures without people in them. Only one bathroom stall too? Parked at thunder hole (again only two bathrooms) and did the roadside easy hike to otter cliffs. Great stopping points on rocky shore along the way. Unfortunately it was foggy (even at noon) that day and couldn’t see water from cliffs. Couldn’t believe that fog was worse as morning went on even on a clear sunny 70s day. I would have thought the sun would have burned it off. Oh well. Made for some pretty pictures from a distance. We did the whole park in two days but we only hit main points of interest.

Next we went to Sand Beach - amazing beach - not too long, but great waves due to the rock formations on both sides of this beach. Water temp in late July was 55.5 degrees-brrrr.

Acadia National Park,"On an 8 day motorcycle ride from Baltimore to Maine and back this was one of the featured stops. Unfortunately Maine was socked in with a lot of fog but since this was a trip that had been 2 years in the planning we decided to make the best of it. We took the auto loop and were able to stop at and see many of the popular spots. The views even though foggy were beautiful. We overlooked Bar Harbor, went to Sand Beach, Thunder Hole and other popular spots. We tried to do Cadillac Mountain and got about 3/4 of the way up when the fog got to be so thick we couldn't see the tour bus in front of us. At that point we thought it best for safety to head back down. Really well maintained roads, was a pleasure to ride on. The scenery was just awesome. Plan to go back. Highly recommend.","August 1, 2018",Awesome But Foggy Visit,148,"Baltimore, Maryland",5
Acadia National Park,"Acadia National Park has lots to explore. There are many trails to hike and many areas to explore. Bicycle rentals are a good way to see the park. We had a car but saw many using the free Island Explorer for transportation. We drove to the top of Cadillac Mountain and were unable to find a place to park but could see the breathtaking views. We later returned on the Island Explorer Bus and enjoyed the fabulous view from the top of the mountain. Thunder Hole was great, very cool to see the ocean with the waves rushing in. We also passed the Carriage horse ride which looked amazing. If you drive, parking at some of the attractions can be a challenge especially close to Jordan's Pond. We basically circled the parking lot until a free space opened up.

Our first day, we arrived by 8:30 a.m. (Thanks to a whale watching excursion that was cancelled due to fog and rough seas) and parked at Sand Beach, and walked the Ocean Path out and back. What a great way to experience some of Acadia's most beautiful views! The path was very, very clogged around Thunder Hole, but less crowded as you went along. We veered off the path to find secluded spots on the rocks over the ocean. We finished with lunch at Jordan Pond House. The second day we drove around the park and hopped out at various spots. Unfortunately, they closed down the road up Cadillac Mountain, and an injury meant I wasn't up to hiking to the summit. Next time! Time on the sea wall was especially beautiful, though.

Acadia National Park,"We visited Acadia during our stay at Bar Harbour. It is beautiful and a must-see if in the area but it was also unbelievably busy! I would definitely recommend a guided tour (we had a CD which provided directions up the mountain and guided us to the must-see spots along the way). If you are going in summer be aware it does get extremely busy due to it being such a popular destination. We looked for parking at Jordan's Pondhouse for a total of 1 1/2 hours and missed a few places along the way to unavailability of parking. About 30-40 minutes to get parking at Cadillac Mountain. It can be frustrating if unprepared so bring water and snacks if driving! If I were to do it again, I would get the tour bus, which seemed to drop people off at the important spots along the way without the drama of finding parking, although I'm not sure how costly an option this is? We didn't have time to do any hikes, which I would definitely make time to do next time. A walk around the lake at Jordan Pond is definitely a must-do (took us about an hour). Make sure you stop for popovers first at Jordan's Pondhouse. In busy season, again, it can be about a 40-minute wait for a table so make sure you plan for that but it is worth it! Also super dog-friendly with great service!","July 27, 2018","Definitely worth a visit, be careful in busy season!",13,"Upwey, Australia",4

An excursion to Bass Point Lighthouse is good but it is off the beaten path and it is difficult to get out on the rocks far enough to get a good view.

Left is also a little bit more challenging so start out strong and finish easy. It is a lovely hike.. parts were under construction but we were able to go around the entire pond even though others kept telling us the path was closed.. evidently they could not read the detour signs the park put up.

Just because our day drive wasn’t in idyllic conditions doesn’t diminish the beauty of the shoreline, bogs, forest paths, along the way. We completed the trek up Cadillac Mountain, where we played in the clouds - literally.

The views were great and were a lot of trails to walk. We got to Jordan Pond about 11 and made a reservation at the restaurant. Make sure to order the popovers! They serve them hot out of the oven and they are delicious! I would recommend going early in the morning and definitely using the bus system; which is free.

Acadia National Park,Acadia is a beautiful place. I suggest using the shuttle system. We drove into the park and parked at the main visitor center at 10 am and then took the shuttles. The other parking areas along loop road were already full. The ocean path is easy and very scenic with taking side detours climbing on the rocks. We did the grab and go for sandwiches at Jordan Pond. The only place to eat in the park is Jordan Pond restaurant and it is a sit down place. We ate on the balcony and then hiked around the Pond. Half the trail is easy and the other half has challenging sections with rocks to climb over it takes around 2.5 hours. The Eagle Lake trail is moderate to hard and the Gorham mountain trail is moderate due to the elevation change and the path but very worth the view.

It was good and informative, saw a lot of stars, though the half moon really messed it up. HUGE tip; don't go to Thunder Hole at high tide, you will not get the affect. We got to go by earlier in the morning and heard the ""thunder"" and then went back by at high tide to get our NPS books stamped and thought we'd go see it again. Nothing, I felt sorry for the people staring and probably wondering ""what's the big deal about this?"" It was full of water so as the waves came in there was no boom. We went to Echo Lake on our 1/2 day and swam, the water was cold but we got use to it quickly and it was very refreshing. Great view swimming at the base of the mountain. Left Echo Lake and went to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse. Very small parking lot. Tip: take the path to the left of the lot and be prepared to climb some rock to get a really good view of the lighthouse. Its a very short hike. ","July 21, 2018",Beautiful,40,"Brooks, Georgia",5

Gentle walking to much more challenging hiking and biking are just some of the things to do... The weather was so great, mid 70s during the days and mid to low 60s at night in July, just wonderful for being outdoors. We hiked up to and down from Cadillac Mountain, a little bit challenging, mostly for the distance involved and length of the trip. Great views of most of the park on the way down! In the evenings we would drive up to the top of Cadillac for the outstanding star gazing in the cool night air. My wife and I had a great time and we highly recommend a visit!

Acadia National Park,"The park is not doable in one day. Most suggest a week and we did it in 2 days. We spent a lot of time in Bar Harbor. The views are absolutely breathtaking and the shops were cute and fun to look around. We then stopped at Sand Beach which was really neat. It was cold and windy the day we went so just checked out the views and left. We then started walking to Thunder Mountain, but it's quite a trek with a stroller. We didnt make it all the way there, but did see some more stunning views on our walk. We ended up driving to Thunder Mountain and I stayed in the car w the kids while husband checked it out, he says it was pretty neat and worth the stop. We drove around the entire island checking out all of the villages, though none of the others had anything we stopped at outside of beautiful views. We stayed the night at Kimball Terrace Inn on Northeast Harbor. The next day we went back to acadia since it was foggy our first day to get clearer views and we are so glad we did. We saw the top of Cadillac Mountain both with rain and fog and clear and beautiful. It does not disappoint. It has bed rock to run around on, a path and amazing views. We used the stroller but there are some stairs so husband and I had to carry it up/down. Wasnt awful and view was worth it, but be prepared. The gift shop has blueberry soda which was pretty tasty! The lighthouse in Bass Harbor was breathtaking and worth the drive. Theres also a walking path to some stairs to the left of the parking lot. Those stairs go down to more rocks to get you and even closer view of the water and boats.","July 20, 2018",Amazing!!,3,"Gardner, Kansas",5
Acadia National Park,"I grew up going to Acadia and this is where I fell in love with nature. Sunrise or sunset the views are incredible and outside of the city lights you can see every star. Hikes around Jordan pond are a nice way to spend an afternoon with friends or family and are kid friendly. If you like the water and a little adventure then I would strongly suggest Otter Cliffs and Sand Beach, the walks along the cliffs are truly beautiful and the beach can be a nice quiet spot in off peak months.","July 19, 2018",Heaven on Earth,7,,5

There were no bugs, but it did heat up so we started our hikes early. Even the ""moderate"" trails have spots that are pretty challenging with the size of the rocks. Sunscreen and water are a must, as well as good hiking boots with a thick tread - tennis shoes won't work. Be careful where you park - they are proactive on ticketing. There is a bus that stops at trail heads.","July 17, 2018",Happily exhausted,17,Michigan,5
Acadia National Park,"Purchased the pass at the Bar Harbor Visitors Center. Once entering the park, the Ranger exchanged this for a hanging mirror placard. The drive around the large loop is filled with jaw-dropping views. There are numerous parking areas and if you want, you can stop and park in the right lane. Yes, be aware that there are two lanes on the loop, the right lane is used for parking. The driver needs to have eyes forward looking for stopped vehicles not looking at the sights. The trip to Cadillac Summit is winding and you may pass bicycles. There are several parking places on this road. Once at the summit, you can walk on a park made path or on the granite in designated places. Views are eye-opening. The park's visitors center is a climb of 50+ steps from the parking lot. There is a separate entrance for handicap vehicles that is on the level of the visitors' center. Recommend entering at the 0900 to beat the rush of visitors.

Acadia National Park,"This park has so many layers! Start by hitting the main spots and then delve deeper into it. Tons of trails and attractions to choose from. We fell in love with this park and want to go back and stay for a whole week. We only did 2 nights there. Drive around Ocean Path and park at every parking lot and get out and look at the amazing sights. Walking that trail isn't really necessary. Save your energy for a more exciting trail that you can only access on foot. You should go in the evening when everyone is leaving. There was tons of parking then. It does get CRAZY crowded. Be prepared to park far away from some things and walk a bit if you go in the morning or afternoon especially. Wild Gardens was like that. Very crowded. Sand Beach also very crowded but great if you want the sandy beach experience. We were there to explore, so we only stopped briefly to see it. If you are not a plant buff, skip the Wild Gardens. I wouldn't do them again, though I did love taking pictures of the dew on the leaves and the few flowers and blueberries that were in bloom there. It's a quick stop if you want to do it. You can easily avoid crowds by going deeper into the trails or going early in the morning or else in the evening. If you want a fairly easy hike with amazing coastal rocky views and waves splashing - do the Ship Harbor Trail on the quiet side! We loved it and it only takes like an hour if you don't stop - maybe 2 if you stop and sit on the rocks or go tide pooling. This park is huge and beautiful and wonderful.

The bus was not over-full but there weren't many empty seats. (If you want to do this tour, you probably ought to make your reservations well in advance) Since it started life as a school bus, leg room was minimal, but my bride has short legs and I sat by the aisle so we did fine. The drive to Acadia was pleasant. Once we entered the park, the scenery got even more spectacular. Our driver/guide knew A LOT about the area and freely shared his knowledge without being pushy.

There was a lot of boulder climbing involveled, particularly climbing Acadia. The way down was easier and there were some rudimentary steps carved into the boulders but the direction we took was challenging. We have two very fit preteens who had no trouble with it, but I, the mama, struggled a bit. It was beautiful, smelled amazing, due to the trees and was really a step out of normal life. There were goorgeous views of Soames Sound from both peaks. There was nothing that looked like civilization and we saw very few (maybe 10 total) other people along the way.

The park is very pretty, though we happened to be there on a very foggy day, so we didn't get to see the vistas as well as I would have liked. However, the whole park is meant to be a place to relax, enjoy nature, and get away for the hectic ness of life. In the, it is a huge success. It is so serene and relaxing.

We arrived on day at 8am at the Hulls Cove Visitor Center, purchased the park pass, bought a few souvenoirs, and then proceeded on our entire day journey on the famous 27-mile Park Loop Road. We purchased an on-line tour guide for $5 (equivalent to the CD), which was nice. Each of the roughly 20 stops went from good to great. Great mountain views, rocky-shore lines, an amazing beach, the forest, and finished with the unbelievable views from the very top of Cadillac Mountain. You can walk/hike as little or as much as you want. On the 2nd day, we returned to the beach and spent a few hours in the rather cold ocean. This beach is surrounded by rocks/forest. I’ve seen nothing like it in the world. We will definitely return.","July 6, 2018",Simply amazing!,17,"New York City, New York",5

Acadia National Park,"National Parks are a national treasure and Acadia is no exception. It's a gorgeous park with many different places to explore. We focused on one. The Ocean Path at Acadia National Park is a beautiful trail along the water. It's a wonderful hike for kids who like to climb rocks and explore. The photos we took are gorgeous. But the hike is listed as EASY which it is not. I mean, it's not super steep, but there were a lot of older people on the path struggling with the exposed roots and unlevel rock stairs. Everything I read about it made it sound easy but it was hard for the grandparents in our group and for many of the other grandparents I saw hiking. Mostly our issue was my parents not realizing their new limitations, but I'm passing on this warning as I saw quite a few of the 70+ crowd struggling. My husband and I offered many hands to people who needed it.","July 5, 2018",National Parks are a national treasure and this one is no exception.,10,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Acadia National Park,"When it comes to beautiful scenary few states can rival Maine in the fall; and, few parks are more beautiful than Acadia. The hardwood trees of Maine are rich in color. The color of the park against the backdrop of the northern coast of Maine creates an unforgettable of the majestic and serene. The area allows the traveler to visit some of the grand lighthouses, lending the park and surrounding area a touch of New England in times past. Though too many souvenir shops and stores that cater to the many tourist are beginning to overwhelm Bar Harbor's main street, it remains a quaint picturesque town. Our favorite spot to visit remains Cadillac Mountain. In the fall the temperature atop the mountain can turn quickly cold. It is best to carry a windbreaker to weather the cold brusque wind. Still, the color of fall that spreads before the visitor for miles is breathtaking and worth enduring the cold wind. Never will you breath cleaner air. ","July 3, 2018",Dr.,23,"Valdosta, Georgia",5

Acadia National Park,"We had limited time on this New England road trip, so only had one day to spend in the park. No, that is definitely not enough time to see and do much! We decided to focus on the 27 mile loop drive and the sites along it. We started at the visitor center and were disappointed that there weren't many programs going on (during the week, just before high season) but appreciated the info and picked up a Junior Ranger activity book for our son. As others have mentioned, a very large majority of this drive is ONE WAY. My husband blew right by the first cluster of sites and there was no way to get back to it. At the end of the day, we considered heading back, but looked at the next available ""bail out"" spot and decided we didn't have time. Again, given that it wasn't quite high season, some of the activities required in the Junior Ranger book were difficult to achieve, but the friendly Ranger at the end of the day appreciated my son working several extra activities from the book to make up for the ability to do some of the other items. Even though it was still a couple of weeks from that high season and mid-week, it was rather busy. Plan to walk to some of the sites, parked outside of the main parking area. Our favorite spots were Thunder Hole, Sandy Beach and the top of Cadillac Mountain. The beautiful scenery alone makes this a must-do park!  Definitely worth a visit and we plan to do so with much more available time in the future so we can hike and bike!","July 2, 2018",Beautiful scenery,156,"Fort Worth, Texas",4

Acadia National Park,"We took a cruise that stopped in Bar Harbor, and we decided to do a bus tour of Acacia National Park. It was a long tour (about 6 hours, including a stop for lunch), and yet we still could have used a little more, as our last few stops (Cadillac Mountain and the Wild Gardens) were a bit rushed.We stopped at various overlooks to explore and to take photos. I believe that our first major stop was Thunder Hole. Although there were a lot of people, there were so many places to explore that you could get away from just about everyone--most of my photos don't have anyone in them! We proceeded to Jordan Pond, which provided views of two smaller mountains known as the ""Bubbles"" (north and south). After lunch we headed up the winding road to the awe-inspiring Cadillac Mountain, with its incredible views of the Porcupine Islands. I definitely wish we had more time there! Our final stop was the Wild Gardens, where there was also a museum and natural center. Although this stop was nice, given the shortness of our visit, I would have preferred to spend more time exploring the mountain. Even better, it would have been nice to walk or bike the carriage trails, which don't allow motorized vehicles.

The left entrance stars with 1.5 miles of wood plank walking. Then you climb over large rocks and the right side is pretty smooth. Very cool path, but just know what you're getting in to. We didn't read the sign very well and thought it'd be a short 1.5 trek :D No regrets as it was a very fun path.

While small, Acadia is spread out over several areas of the park and has a ton to offer. First off, the park is beautiful! From oceans to bays to rocks to forests and flowers, there is a variety to look at and explore. There are hikes to suit all different levels of skill and they are varied. The park is also extremely clean and well maintained. There is a definite pride in this park. I'm not sure how much of this has to do with it being smaller and us going at the very early beginning of ""tourist"" season, but this was the cleanest and best maintained park we have visited yet (and we have hit about half). We loved both the Mount Desert portion of the park, as well as the much quieter Winter Harbor/Schoodic peninsula.

This was my first trip to Maine and I have to admit, I thought it would be hard to top Glacier National Park from 2 years ago, but Acadia is truly a gem. It's small and easy to get around. Many of the trails are easy to do with small kids and ""older"" kids. There are lots of activities in and out of the park. The scenery is spectacular!

We did the Beehive Trail but followed the easier climb to the summit. Still requires a bit of stamina for the gradual climb. WOW was it worth it - the panoramic views were amazing. Admire those that took the trail close to the rock face with a sheer drop and assisted by some metal bars. No safety harness or safety nets in sight - you do the walk, you take the risk, seems fair to me. Virtually each turn on the road revealed another picture taking moment.

Acadia National Park,"Good park . I spent two days in the park and enjoyed it . First day we couldn't do much work in our junior ranger programs because they didn't have pencils for the kids to work with . We are avid jr rangers, make sure to bring your own pencils. The loop is one way ( worst part I think ) so make sure to pay attention where you're going and what your agenda Is and timing because if you pass it ..you'll be out of luck for 30 some miles again . The sign said sand beach was full twice ..and both times the parking lot was almost empty, it would be nice if that sign was updated every once in a while. There is alot of construction by the hulls entrance /bar harbor entrance and that was a pain as navigation wasn't utd and the stop light that controls the four way stop sign before the entrance isn't working so it's a mess . The trees and sand beach were beautiful but otherwise nothing special and one of the least educational nps I've been to (21st location ) . It's definately worth seeing if you have a NPS pass and in the area . ","June 13, 2018",Must see,25,,5

Acadia National Park,"I am writing this from the point of view of a day hiker (about 300 miles annually). Acadia is outstanding in that there are options with fantastic views for all levels from easy to very strenuous with ladders and narrow ledges. You have views everywhere of ocean, ocean cliffs, streams, lakes, harbors, mountains, etc. All within a relatively small area. The thing to know here is that, unlike most hike areas, the mountain hikes are short and straight up the granite slope. Scrambling up boulders, rocks, stairs and ladders. The other good thing as the there are a multiple trail options to chain together a few shorter hikes into longer loops. For example Gorham, Bowl, Beehive and Ocean trails form a 7 mile loop with moderate beginning up Gorham , challenging middle at Beehive and easy finish on the Ocean trail…all with great views!","June 13, 2018",Outstanding National Park,51,"Huntersville, North Carolina",5

The hiking is unlike other national parks I've been too, we were rock scrambling on many of the hikes we did, it wasn't just flat gravel trail. The kids in our group loved this! The views at the tops of the mountains we hiked were incredible (but you'll want to hike on a clear day). We were here early June and had no problems finding parking, and there were no crowds to speak of. We spent about three days here and camped in the park, and I felt like that was enough time to hit most of the highlights, but I will be coming back to Acadia in the future!","June 10, 2018",One of my favorite national parks!,12,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",5
Acadia National Park,"Apparently the fifth smallest of the national parks by land area but one of the top 10 most visited! Gorgeous scenery but only giving it a 4 star as I have been to better and I think the hype about the place, I expected more. The part you pay your $30 fee (which I think is a bit steep), is the bit with the loop drive. Although you can get on at different sections and avoid the main gates, don't think you can avoid the fee. We saw the rangers actively looking at each car to see if the pass was displayed and waiting patiently, blocking any cars in with their trucks, who did not have a ticket. Would advise you to take drinks and food in with you although there is a restaurant at Jordan Pond House (we did not realise and came off at Seal Harbour hoping to find a small cafe, desperately wanting an ice cream - by the way there is a small restaurant there and a cafe next door which was closed). The restaurant at Jordan Pond was very busy (it was Saturday but not yet high season), so you had to put your name down for a table. If you do not want to wait there is a grab and go section above the gift shop for drinks,, and small choice of ice cream, they may have had sandwiches but by the time we got there there was nothing left. Unlike most of the national parks we have been to, there was no newspaper listing in detail some popular walks in order of difficulty. I somehow felt that they were wanting you to buy the walking maps but we only had the day so was not worth it. Would recomend you either buying the maps or researching ahead and printing off some basic maps. The main walk that everyone seemed to do was the Sand beach to Otter Point. 4.4 miles total round trip. Although it looked really nice with the views just felt that it was a little boring, a lot or most of it was walking along a path next to the main road and then walking back again. We were here on Saturday the 9th of June and I think the free buses started around the 23 of June to sometime in September so I would imagine it would be manic with people and cars during the period of time. You also have the cruise ship people and coaches to contend with as well! Just a tip, they had signs up saying some of the main parking lots were full and people were parking miles down the road, try the parking lots, when we got there we managed to find spaces quite easily and saves the boring walk along the road. Going up Cadillac Mountain for the view was definitely worth the trip, amazing views (take a jacket as even on a nice day it can be rather breezy up there.","June 9, 2018","Lovely, but the hype made me expect more!",65,"Stockport, United Kingdom",4

Acadia National Park,"A few years ago, I had never even heard of Acadia National Park (and I just turned 62), but I am very happy that my wife and I took the time to visit. We were visiting Cape Cod and took the long drive there, but it was worth every mile and hour that it took to get there. It was chilly in early June when we got there, but it was amazing. It was misty/rainy and 45 degrees when we went after an early dinner. Because of the nasty weather, we saw very few others in the park or on the road. We stopped at Thunder Hole and because the surf was kicking up, the hole was booming. I got some great pictures, although I missed out on taking sunset and night skies pictures because of the cloud cover, but that just gives me another reason to go back up there. I am not a hiker, but I know there are some great hikes in Acadia. I did take some great pictures, including some the next day of Jordan Pond after we had popovers.

Acadia National Park,"This was my family's first trip to Acadia, but it won't be our last. We were only here for two and a half days (plus we had other activities planned in Bar Harbor) and it rained the third day, so we did not get to do all of the hikes we had planned. My 14 year old son, 12 year old daughter, husband and I we able to easily hike the Gorham Mountain Trail as well as the Great Head Trail including the jaunt to Sandy Beach. The views were absolutely stunning! Both trails were appropriately rated as ""moderate."" However, my husband had not been to a park with actual rock hiking trails, so the difficulty was a little more than he expected. We saved Wonderland Trail and Ship Harbor Trail (our favorite of the two) for the rainy day because we read there were less rocks making it less slippery. We made sure the tide was out when we hiked. The kids loved looking in the tide pools. The only thing was we had to limit going out on the rocks near the ocean because they were slippery.I highly recommend stopping at Hulls Cove Visitor's Center and purchasing a waterproof map as well as taking pictures of the high and low tide times. Also, I wish I had purchased hiking boots for the moderate trails. I wore running trail shoes, but the stiffness of hiking shoes with the ankle support would have been better.","June 5, 2018",Stunning views!,7,"Akron, Ohio",5

Acadia National Park,"This was my family’s first time at Acadia. We visited Zion, Bryce, and Grand Canyon last summer so were on a National Park kick. Acadia was different but just as beautiful. Our first night, we drove up Cadillac Mtn to watch the sunset. It was pretty crowded up there...hard to find a parking spot. There were other places along the trail we could’ve pulled over to capture the sunset too. The next day we hiked Sand Beach which was an easy flat trail. Great for the whole family and even young children could hike it. For those who preferred hanging out at the beach, you can at the foot of the trail where the restrooms and water filling station is. After that, my family did Beehive which was harder. There’s one part that is steep with meta bars. My adult children did that and had no problems but I was a little scared (fear of heights) so hubby and I took the longer way around. Great view from the top. The next few days we hiked Penobscot which has a spectacular view. It wasn’t the easiest but not the hardest either. Longer than some of the other trails. And the start was by Jordan Pond House. One thing I noticed were the black flies. They were annoying. We didn’t encounter any on the beach trail but this one had a lot. We were told that it was because the flies are near the pond. So be forewarned. Bring bug spray or a netting for your head. You can buy bug spray at the store but not sure how expensive it is. Stopped off on the way back to eat popovers at Jordan Pond House. The wait wasn’t too bad but the popovers were very enjoyable. Our final day was a hike to Bubble Rock and Bubble trail. Not difficult either but sightly narrow and there are some steep steps where only one person can go at a time. Overall, we had a great time although we didn’t cover as much as we liked. Also Precipe trail was closed as birds were nesting. Quite different from the parks out West but just as lovely and smaller in scale. I told my family that the parks out west are massive and grandiose but Acadia is unique that it is by beautiful lakes and beaches. Would definitely go again.

Acadia National Park,"To me how much someone will enjoy Acadia is based off of what other travel an individual has done. The park is well organized, trails are well documented, and the signage to navigate the park is outlined very well. The park is very beautiful with many different hiking trails and a variety of wildlife. Having said that, there are a lot of tour buses due to the cruise ships which made sightseeing impossible in the event you ended up where the tour buses dropped off. Being fortunate to travel to other countries and experience hiking trails and nature activities, Acadia was just average to me. If I lived closer I would definitely take advantage to being able to get out on some hiking trails and proximity to great seafood. Having traveled almost a the same time it would take to get to Europe I'd rather spend my time visiting other cultures.","June 1, 2018",Long Weekend In Bar Harbor,181,Pennsylvania,3
Acadia National Park,"The park was nice, rangers were helpful, maps were excellent. The views were pretty, but not magnificent; most of it was like a drive through the country, but there are quite a few ocean shots, but the parking there is tough. We were surprised at the LACK of wildlife. I guess I was expecting too much, but the only birds (we saw) were sea gulls and black birds; the only animals we saw was a little snake. I was hoping to see an eagle or osprey and maybe some dolphins in the sea. There are many hiking trails which are really nice and I advise you get out take some - stretch your legs and breathe some nice fresh air. The air was fresh and clean, we liked that. We went over Memorial Day and the weather was COOL (50 degrees), so we really couldn't appreciate a sunrise or sunset, nor could we 'star-gaze', which we really wanted to do. We spent about 10 minutes on Cadillac Mountain and left - too cold. Keep this in mind for future visits; cooler weather limits what you can do if you are adverse to cooler weather. Due to the cooler weather, it was NOT very busy at the park, but it was an issue parking at Cadillac Mountain and many overlooks. I can see that in nice weather, this place would be a zoo and you'll be driving around a lot. Much of the park is one-way, so if you want to return to a spot that you couldn't find parking the first time, you're going MANY miles around to get back there.

They have trails all over along with a park loop for those wanting the views and prefer to drive. Offer kayaking, bikes, boat tours. Didn’t have time to explore the towns but will definitely be back to do that. Recommend at least one sunrise, we barely made it to a 5:16 am one. A must so add it to your list!

Acadia National Park,"I have lived in Los Angeles for 45 years and have been to San Franciso several times, so I know something about traffic obviously, and I have been to 33 National Parks, 30 U.S. states and 10 countries. The drive on the 3 from about Ellsworth down to Acadia is the WORST drive I have ever done. The speed limit through tiny towns is artificially already very low, and then local people and tourists drive way below that. You get stuck behind trucks and terrible drivers for hours on a single lane road. The drive was so bad we illegally passed several cars over the 90 minutes it took to drive only a few miles into the park. It's high time that Maine build a direct highway route with higher speed limits directly to Acadia instead of being stuck in the horrible dumpy towns you must drive through. Once we were in Acadia NP, the directional signs weren't very good at all! And the Acadia NP map we got at the entrance just showed a ""park loop,"" when the lighthouse and other things to see are ""out of the loop."" The map isn't labeled very well either. The park loop was very nice and not that big- we did it in a couple of hours, but it's probably better to go in the summer and during Fall leaf change. We saw zero animals. We were there May 1 and it was cold and damp!","May 4, 2018",Drive on the 3 from Ellsworth down to Acadia and back north is the WORST drive EVER!!!!,112,"San Diego, CA",4
Acadia National Park,"We have visited Acadia for decades and during many seasons. This is a special place to visit over and over again. It is a unique National Park because it is also part of a community. The people of Bar Harbor make this place warm and inviting. Everyone can find something to do at any season here. Hiking, walking, horse back riding and bicycle riding on well maintained trails with unbelievable views of forest and ocean during warm weather. Cross country skiing if there is snow Or just enjoying getting away for a brief winter vacation. If you plan on visiting ME you must visit Acadia. Be sure to include Schoodic Point on the mainland just a short drive north or take a ferry to the beautiful quiet place and watch the pilot whales swim in the ocean the the mountain of Acadia as the background.

Acadia National Park,"The first things most people see in Acadia National Park are Sand Beach, Thunder Hole and the other features along the Loop Drive outside of Bar Harbor. BTW - see these early in the morning and you may share the experience only with seagulls and eagles - as close to wild as you can get on the Atlantic coast. But there's so much more to the park. The Schoodic section and the parts of the park on the islands are arguably even more beautiful and certainly not so overrun with people during the summer months. Tide tables will tell you the times of incoming tides - best for dramatic views of surf along the rocky coast. Enjoy, and then come back in the winter just after a storm and you'll see really big waves and surf-spray!","April 20, 2018",Acadia is so much more than the Loop Drive,18,Gouldsboro,5

Acadia National Park,"Okey...I know you want to read all about the hidden gems, but golly, there is not one thing I can tell you that others have not already said, except you truly will not regret traveling to Acadia National Park. We went in the fall and was blown away by all the beauty. Yes, there are tour buses, but with a bit of negotiating travel along the loop between the bigger buses (we were in a pickup truck) you are afforded a must see advantage without the press of time. Make sure to bring with you a picnic lunch or prepared to eat at the only restaurant in the park. We brought a ""tail gate"" fare and was thrilled to find picnic areas. If you are an early riser, you can also take advantage of the park's ""first light"" on Cadillac Mountain ; the mountain where the sun hits comparatively first in the United States. . Parking fares are available at the park's entrance, but make sure to take advantage of discounts either during regular business hours at the road side center right before getting to the park or go online. We were traveling with a US Marine Veteran and his vehicle was granted free parking permit. Being that we were of ""seasoned"" years we also got a significant discount by buying our passes prior to getting to the Park's entrance.

We loved Acadia National Park. It was definitely the best part of our trip and since it was our last stop of the trip we really wished we could have spent more time here than some of the other stops on the trip, Our only problem we had while there was that as we were driving through we kept turning at the wrong spot. Which added more to the drive to get where we wanted to go since the road is one way and a big loop around the island. This really isn't much of a complaint just know that you need to pay attention or be willing to park and walk around more.

Acadia National Park,"We visited Acadia National Park in November, which was later than we had planned. The weather is getting cold but the beauty of the park is still obvious. At the beginning is the road to Cadillac Mountain. From Oct to March, this is where the first sunrise is visible in the US. Due to the time of year we went, we did not encounter any traffic jams, but if you go in the summer additional time should be allowed. It is a beautiful site to see the sun rise over the water and islands in the early morning and to say you saw it! If you continue on the road becomes a 27 mile 1-way loop. Our next stop was Sand Beach. This is a smaller sand beach surrounded by the rock cliffs. Rumor has it the water doesn't get much higher than 55 degrees, but nice to check out tidepools and the ocean. We also stopped at Thunder Hole. Unfortunately, the ocean was calm so we weren't able to see the full force. We read the ideal time to see this is 2 hours before high tide and if the water is wavy (after a storm). There is a crevice between rocks where the water comes in and out with the tide. As it comes it it makes at least a gurgling sound, but hopefully a thunderous sound as it hits the cave at the end. There is a walkway down there which when in full force gets pretty wet as the water splashes up like a blowhole. We also visited Bubble Rock ( .5 mile uphill climb ) which gives a beautiful view. There are many trails along the water and cliffs where you can get some fantastic views of the rocks / cliffs.I don't live too far from this park but was my first visit. The scenery was very New England, so not foreign to me. I have also visited 44 National Parks and I can say Acadia is a beautiful park that holds its own against many of the parks out West.

This is a must do trip, the views along the road at absolutely stunning. There are many carve out spots on the road so you can pull over to admire on your way to the various destinations of the park and you should stop. Of course Cadillac mountain is just breath taking and it's fun to wonder the paths and if your brave enough go off the paths on the rocks. Just be sure to wear appropriate foot wear. We also stopped at Thunder Hole, although this trip no noise and Jordan's pond as well as stops along the way to admire the view. PLEASE if your in the area, go to Bar Harbor. We even went back up to Cadillac mountain on our way home to take in the view one more time. Next time we plan to walk some of the paths and trails to get even more out of the Acadia Experience.

We went to sand beach-- almost empty at this time of year and scrambled up the headland's loop-- need to be a bit more adventuresome.-- there are scrambles up the granite. Strongly recommend you take some walks on the carriage trails. They were empty and it was nice not worrying about cars.The Jordan Pond trail is a 3.2 mile loop around the lake.

Acadia National Park,Acadia gets day trippers off the cruiseships ( 3000-10000 cruisers per day in Bar Harbor) and many tourists from Bar Harbor seeking the special views on the mountain tops . It is a two lane road to accomodate seasonal travelers not so well. Backups occur and the driver hates to stop to take a view to lose their place in line up the hill.

Acadia National Park,"All of our National Parks are wonderful....Acadia is no exception. Perhaps one difference here (versus many other National Parks) is that the roads are pretty much a circle (technically closer to an oval) around the park. Thus, to us, the park was very easy to navigate. There is a restaurant, Jordan Pond, available for food....if you are on a tight schedule, you might consider packing your lunch.We visited late in September. We did not have any problem parking at any of the sites/lookouts. Like most National Parks we have visited, parking may have been a problem during the peak of the tourist season. It was interesting that there were a number of areas where parking was permitted on the main road to supplement parking lots or turn-offs. The reason that this was possible is that the roads were one way roads at those points.Lots to see and appreciate.....take plenty of pictures.","October 24, 2017",Thing of beauty,336,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

The views were breathtaking, still a lot of fall colors which were beautiful. We did a couple of short walks/hikes, there are trails for all skill levels and they are clearly marked.

Once we got away from tourists and off the beaten path we loved the area and experience. Leaves were changing so there was a variety of color. The beach area and rocky areas to the north were wonderful to walk and hike on. Cadillac Mountain has wonderful panoramic views. We were told to go there at sunrise and thought we'd be part of a small group. There were at least 1,000 people there, many before 6 a.m. If you're going to do the sunrise (and you should), go early!! When we got there at 6:20 a.m. the parking lot was completely full and cars were parked down the road on both sides. This is not normally allowed but I think park rangers don't worry about it because the crowd dissipates once people have seen the sunrise.

We had the boiled lobsters, in order to try its original taste, as well as the infamous lobster roll, in one of the popular seafood restaurant by the pier. Honestly, I personally prefer the ones at Luke's, at half the price!If you are seeking adventure, you may go trekking on one of the many trails, kayaking or even a swim at one of the beaches(if the weather permits).Catching sunrise and sunsets were definitely worth our while as you see the sun rays stream through the foliage, as if you are driving through a sea of gold and fire.Of course, the best way to catch the foliage is by car.Definitely a must if you are in the area at the time of the year!","October 22, 2017",Fall Foliage,20,"Singapore, Singapore",3

Within the park, the wait for lunch over an hour, drove to Bar Harbor for lunch, no parking, left and found a general store a couple miles outside of town and had a hot dog. Another recommendation. With so many people in the park, better make reservations for any of the activities well in advance. We had none for a carriage ride, no dice. Booked full at least a day in advance and maybe longer. A man in line told me he had called at 8 AM that morning and got a reservation only because there was a cancellation called in. This is in the Fall mind you, so summer I'm told is much worse.

Acadia National Park,"My wife and I talked for many years about a trip to coastal Maine during the Fall, specifically visiting Acadia National Park. We finally made the trip this past week and, despite lofty expectations, it did not disappoint.Acadia is the second-most visited national park, after Yellowstone. Don't let this scare you away. Thousands of these visitors come from massive cruise ships that regularly visit Bar Harbor. These visitors come on buses and do not populate the hiking trails.Some of our highlights include:* Lunch at the Jordan House restaurant. The food was surprisingly good, especially the customary popovers.* The hike around Jordan Pond is a relatively easy 3.5-mile walk. We started on the left side which begins with a long (about a mile, or more) of planks that you walk on followed by some easy rock climbing. Then, it's an easy walk the rest of the way. The scenery is gorgeous.* Hiking the Bee Hive, including using the metal rungs embedded in the sheer cliffs. It sounds a little scary - and looks scary from below - but it's not all that challenging BUT it is very rewarding. Plus the views are incredible.As you might suspect, get an early start to avoid the cruise ship crowds and bring a change of clothes for changing conditions. It quickly can change 20-30 degrees and rain can begin at the drop of a hat.In short, we LOVED Acadia and recommend it highly. It is worth the visit.","October 16, 2017",It exceeded our lofty expectations,4,"Chicago, Illinois",5

On Oct 12, we wanted to take a hike and selected the Bald Mountain Summit hike. It is about an 800' ascent but I would say it is somewhat rugged. My wife and I are in our early 60s, in pretty good shape, and found the many rocky areas to be rather challenging. However, the fall foliage was developing (one of the reasons we went to Maine) and the day was cloudless which made for wonderful views as we climbed. We finishing the day back at Cadillac Mountain BEFORE sunset. We walked the summit path (about .5 miles) and had terrific 360 degree views. On Oct 13, we had only a few hours and decided to hike the Jordan Pond Loop, a 3.4 mile trail around Jordan Pond.

Acadia National Park,"We spent 2 days in Bar Harbor and visited Acadia NP both days. The first day was devoted fully to the park. We drove the loop and hiked around, spending about 7 hours in the park in total. The Great Head Trail was a treat, with amazing views form the end of the peninsula. Great tidal pools as well, and a fair amount of privacy. Jordan Pond itself was lovely, but we just couldn't imagine spending an hour waiting for a table at the lodge itself. Cadillac Mountain is obviously a must, but I'd recommend trying to find the actual marked peak (the geo market in the rock). Not only will you be at the tippy-top, but you'll be able to look over at all the tourists over on the path. We went way off-peak, in October. I highly recommend that time of year if you can swing it. Crisp autumn air and the changing leaves. And since enjoyment of the park is dependent upon travelling a single one-way (mostly) loop road, your enjoyment is highly subject to those around you.

We had a CD from our B&B which had a couple dozen stops along the way and explained so much about the building of the park, roads, etc. I highly recommend getting the CD. Took us two days to finish as we stopped and hiked and took pictures and relaxed. We were in Bar Harbor for six days and visited the park almost each day. One day we rented bikes in town and took them on the Island Explorer into the park. The carriage roads are amazing for walking and biking. Everything seemed to be well marked. At one point we even hopped on the bus with our bikes to get to another location instead of back-tracking on the bikes. Rangers were extremely helpful. And the views are spectacular. We don't like to go to the same place twice, but we may make an exception for Acadia.","October 11, 2017",An Amazing National Park,57,"Naples, Florida",5

Acadia National Park,"Acadia National Park has a great park driving loop that takes you around to all the sights. Our particular stops included Cadillac mountain (which I'd assume is a stop for just about everyone), the sand beach, Gorham mountain trail, Bubble Rock trail, Jordan Pond trail (and gift shop) and a few other miscellaneous stops. My wife has balance issues so our hike around Jordan Pond was a real adventure with the long (and slow for us) walk over its wooden planks. The planks then ended at a section where you needed to hike over and around a section of large rocks. But balance issues aside, it was fun! We spent two full days in the park which was sufficient for us to see many of the main attractions. I wholeheartedly recommend visiting Acadia National Park and Bar Harbor, Maine.","October 11, 2017",Great national park with convenient park loop,8,"Palatine, Illinois",5
Acadia National Park,Although the circular route is only 27 miles long it took us 7 hours to complete the tour. Starting with an introductory video in the Visitors Centre to set the seen you are then tempted to stop at every opportunity to enjoy the vista or walk through the gardens etc.Try to time your visit to be at the top of Cadillac Mountain to enjoy the sunset.

The first day we visited parking was impossible. Is it time to limit private vehicles?

Acadia National Park,"Ended up there on a sat., sun., was way to crowded. It is a wonderful view, did the 20 mile loop. Went to the top of Cadillac Mtn. and finally found a space to park on sat, returned on sun. and could not find any place to park. There is limited pull offs and in some areas, which are one way only, you can park in the right hand lane, which was also iffy to find a place to park if you have difficulty walking. I advise you to stop if you see a spot, because remember it is one way in certain areas so you can not turn around, you would need to re do part of the loop. Also, I stopped to get driving permit at one of the visitors centers which was like 54 steps to the top office, then learned that if you go out of the parking lot and turn right , there is a road that takes you to the top for handicapped access. There are different passes , for my car it was $25.00 for a week pass, For myself, I still prefer the Blue Ridge parkway, especially in the Smokey Mountains.","October 3, 2017",First Visit,16,"Akron, Ohio",4

The first day we took the free bus trip along the Loop Road, however, we had fog on the first half of the Loop and missed some outstanding natural vistas along the Main Coast. We did stop at Jordan Pond and ordered their signature popovers. The view from Jordan Pond should not be missed. The Loop Road bus trip and the lunch stop at Jordan Pond took up most of the morning and early afternoon. The next day, We decided to drive the section of the Loop Road we missed and the vistas were awe inspiring. We also drove the entire Mount Desert Island Loop which was not to be missed either.

Acadia doesn't have ten thousand foot mountains or deep canyons but it is beautiful in its own way. The coast line is something you won't forget. I could have spent all day just watching the waves crashing on the rocks. The views from Cadillac Mountain can't be beat. On a clear day you can see forever. The hiking trails and carriage roads are out of this world. We took a horse drawn carriage ride from the stables and I highly recommend it. It's a great way to see the carriage roads if you don't want to hike or bike around. The lakes and ponds offer loads of great photo ops.

We came here with a group of friends seeking out some of the best spots to take pictures. We found that Cadillac Mountain, while challenging with light, provided some incredible views at sunset. We also enjoyed Sand Beach and the hiking trail (which is fairly challenging) up to the Great Head from there. You get some great perspective and views of the beach below from here. If you don't have a lot of time, stick with the main loop and make use of the pull offs for some great views.

The Otter cliffs was one of my favorite stops full of photo opportunities. Mt.Cadillac was breathtaking. My kids couldn't stop taking pictures. Thunder hole was not cooperating but still cool to see.

We hiked the other 2 days. Cadillac Mountain, Champlain Mountain, and the Beehive are all great hikes with amazing views.

It seems to require a minimum of at least 5 days to fit in some of the island highlights, but it would be easy to spend more time in such a beautiful, welcoming area. The people are very friendly and I was amazed by how many shops there are in Bar Harbor. It is such a beautiful town and area. The traffic is bad, but we stayed at the Days Inn on Route 3 and either took the shuttle service or walked into Bar Harbor, which was close by. The shuttle service is amazingly efficient and runs like clockwork. Acadia National Park is a wonderful destination and I am so glad that we finally got there as we have talked about it for a long time.

Acadia National Park,"The natural beauty of Acadia National park is overwhelming. Every turn there was a new vista and photo opportunity. This is bucket list location. There is so much to do to and see. Hike, climb the mountains, cycle up Cadillac mountain, or bike the carriage trails. There is something here for every one. Our first day here the forecast for rain. A park ranger suggested to take the park loop road and leave Cadillac Mountain for another day. As we got deeper into the park, the sky's cleared up so we first headed up Cadillac mountain. Now I was a little concerned about this as I have a fear of heights, but the ride up was not bad at all. When we reached the top of the mountain there was a small traffic jam getting into the parking lot. This moved slowly as one car left and another entered the parking area. Only about 10-15 minute wait. And the wait was well worth it. The views were incredible. We came down the mountain and picked up on the park loop road. My favorite stop along the route was Otter Creek. We pulled off the side of the road and every where you looked was a postcard picture, beautiful. We proceeded along the way and headed to Jordan Pond. Jordan Pond Parking lot was full, it was midday. This location is also a favorite starting point to bike on the carriage trails. There were many cyclist here on this day. After not finding a parking space we continued to motor through the park. One beautiful scene after another.We returned to Acadia two days later and found the park less crowded more parking. We had intended to go back up Cadillac mountain but the it was overcast with a threat of rain again. So we headed to Thunder Hole instead. We arrived as the tide was coming in and waited a short while for high tide. But alas, no thunder this day. A few burps thats all.We were at the park over Labor Day weekend. It was crowded but manageable. We are already planning to return as we only scratched the surface of this impressive park. There is so much more to explore.I purchased a week long pass for $25.00.

We drove down the peninsula to the Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse. There wasn't a lot to see on the way, but if seeing lighthouses is on your list of things to see and do, then it is worth the drive. Don't miss the path that takes you out to the rocky coast with a different view of the lighthouse. The entrance to the path is to the left of the lighthouse from the parking lot. It was worth the short hike. Then we drove up to Cadillac Mountain. The views from there were beautiful - great views of Bar Harbor and Eagle Lake.

Acadia National Park,"Acadia National Park is indeed beautiful, but we feel it's somewhat overrated. It's not as amazing or breath-taking as the National parks in the west. It's the best of New England, and worth a visit if you're in the area, but we would not fly here from far away.Bar Harbor is a cute little town, colorful and fun, marinas, souvenir shops, lots of lobster restaurants (irrelevant for us), nice friendly people, pleasant atmosphere. Very touristy, all about shopping and pricey dining.There are free shuttle buses to tiwn and the park, but they run infrequently (especially those that carry bikes). Yet it's sometimes better than driving, since parking is tough. Parking near the Jordan Pond House around lunch in the summer is impossible, took us more than an hour of driving around. All lots were full, and the staff would not allow parking on road sides. Also at the top of Cadillac mountain before sunset, the staff would rather enforce regulations than let people enjoy a rare experience. The restaurant at Jordan Pond House is the only place to buy food, you can wait an hour just to get seated, and prices are high. Try to get there off peak hours, or bring your own food to the park.Biking is fun, there are nice trails around lakes etc. But there's nowhere to drink, so carry lots of water with you.If you don't come with high expectations, you can enjoy and have a good time.","August 29, 2017",Reality check,29,"Boston, Massachusetts",3

There is only a one week option of 25$, which is a pitty when you're only there for 2 days, as in our case. Fantastic views. On our second and last evening we wanted to enjoy the sunset and arrived a good 20 minutes before it would happen on the foot. We weren't allowed to drive up Cadillac mountain as it was 'full'.

It was pretty crowded for a Monday, we thought, until we realized (after circling for a space on Cadillac Mountain) that people had flocked there for the partial eclipse. We're still not sure why, as the viewing there isn't any better than anywhere else, but I guess to say you were on Cadillac during the eclipse. So, we were on Cadillac for the 2017 eclipse. lol. The scenery all through the park is gorgeous. If you can only go once, and you want to drive, take the Park Loop Road, and stop at all the places you can. If you want to take the loop only once, make sure you stop at Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and all the others in the one-way section. We went back the following Friday, hiked up the Bubbles, visited Sand Beach, revisited Thunder Hole, and had a great time. If we go back some day, it would be great to take a carriage ride, maybe. The free shuttles from the Visitor Center are very convenient, although we didn't use them. The parking pass was $25, but it was good for a week, which is perfect for vacationers.

We toured the park loop road on a socked in, foggy, rainy, Saturday, and were still lucky to find parking at various hot spots. I can't imagine what it would be like on a clear and sunny day. The park now has sawhorses set up so that you can only park in designated areas. If you are on the one way loop road and cant find a spot to park, then you are out of luck. You can always take the bus tours, which may be a better option, but if you drive up there on vacation you feel more comfy in your own car. Once you get away from the popular spots it is less crowded, but if you are there to see a certain sight, best do so early in the a.m. or later in the evening when the crowds are gone. Highly recommend going up Cadillac Mountain on a moonless night. I have never seen such stars, even out west in NM and AZ where there is little light pollution.

Biked the Witch Hole trail (my first time biking in about 40 years!) stopping along the way to enjoy the water lilies, etc. The hills were tough for me but I did them! Made it a point to hike the Jesup Trail from the Wild Gardens of Acadia. We love the board walk through the woods.","August 21, 2017",Two perfectly clear days of beauty!,10,"Dracut, Massachusetts",5
Acadia National Park,"This is a fabulous park there is nothing not to like about this area. It is breathtaking beautiful. I can say nothing negative and not to worry about parking for they have an island explorer that will take you wherever you want to go. My favorite place was Thunder Hole. The shore, the cliffs the ocean color is amazing. ","August 21, 2017",A fabulous beautiful Park,98,"Yardley, Pennsylvania",5
Acadia National Park,"The Atlantic Ocean, Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, Otter Cliffs, Jordan Pond, The Bubbles, Eagle Lake, Bass Harbor Light, Somes Sound, Cadillac Mountain. Awesome hikes, outstanding views, wonderful scents of coastal Maine. I ask you, ""What's not to love?"" You must experience Acadia for yourself.","August 20, 2017",What's Not to Love?!,9,Maine,5
Acadia National Park,Great vacation. Beautiful scenery. A must do. Great hiking and walking. Really enjoyed Cadillac Mountain and the Park Loop Road as well as hiking the trails and carriage roads.,"August 19, 2017",Exceeded expectations ,1,"Frederick, Maryland",5
Acadia National Park,"We loved this place on two previous visits but after two hours of bumper to bumper driving on the one way road through the park and an inability to park anywhere near any of the sights such as Thunder Hole, Jordan Pond or Cadillac Mountain we decided to leave and go to the Schoodic Penisula. This was 10 times worse than a trip to Disneyworld and left you feeling like you were just a statistic being herded through the park. Literally, you had to park after a half mile of cars parked end to end and walk back to see anything. The paths looked more like Manhattan than Acadia and this was on a Monday. Coach loads of tourists arriving by the minute. What would this gem look like on a weekend during the summer. Set up a lottery for a limited number of day passes each summer and you would return this wonderful place back to its former glory.","August 17, 2017",What a disappointment ,82,"Boston, Massachusetts",2
Acadia National Park,"Spent 4 days exploring Acadia NP. For anyone who loves the outdoors, this park is a must. Beautiful views all over the park and too many hiking, biking trails to cover. Wonderful park staff. One ranger was especially helpful and nice, Jeremy. Really made the park visit special. Thanks!","August 17, 2017",Wonderful NAtional Park!!,158,"Goose Creek, South Carolina",5
Acadia National Park,"Took a couple visits to see much of the park, especially Cadillac Mountain. First try was so fogged in, we had to turn around and head back down.. second attempt was met with a barricade and lot full sign. Third try was a winner as we went and hour before sunset and hung out until thunder went down. Jordan Pond was jammed and both lots were full. Sand Beach was stunning and not too crowded, probably because it's a bit off the beaten path.","August 13, 2017",Gorgeous but crowded,101,"Wixom, Michigan, United States",5
Acadia National Park,"When you live in or near a city, it is wonderful to get out and remember what nature is all about. The beauty of this National Park is a wonderful experience.","August 13, 2017",Natural beauty,25,"Woodbridge, New Jersey",5
Acadia National Park,I would recommend anyone to tour this National Park. It is an amazing place and the cost is nominal to access it. You can stop at various places and easily walk trails. We saw whales just playing and extraordinary views.,"August 12, 2017",Superb Drive,11,"Wirral, United Kingdom",5
