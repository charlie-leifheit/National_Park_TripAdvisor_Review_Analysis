Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,We drove the south rims and stopped at a few pull offs. Then we stayed at sunset view point to watch sunset. Truly stunning! ,"October 15, 2019",Pretty Sunset ,104,"Houston, Texas",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Some of the most magnificent scenery ever! Did 4 miles of hikes near Visitor""s Center one had snow pack and was quite treacherous. The views from the many lookouts were amazing. We probably did an additional 3 miles walking to the lookouts. I wish the National Park would give distances on signs in miles instead of yards. Bring your own food and drinks because there are no concessions. Definitely do the very steep drive down to the river. The views are incredible!","October 12, 2019",Stupendous!,978,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Well worth the trip off the highway. The canyon is stunning, almost a mini version of The Grand Canyon but different colors. More Black rock than red sandstone.. The overlook views were teriffic-actualy a little scary near the edges, but safe. he car and trailer at the overlooks. It would be great if they had some areas set aside just for RV's and trailers at the overlooks. Other than that is was great.","October 12, 2019",Spectacular canyon,179,"Truckee, California",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,This is one of the newer National Parks on Colorado. The south rim has a nice visiter's center. Watch the video first before stopping at some of the overlooks. My favorite is Chasm. Most visitors just do the south rim. The hidden gem is the north rim. Do take the loop trail. This rim is open only durin late spring throug early fall. The road is gravel but easily traveled by car.,"October 10, 2019",A Hidden Gem,11,,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,The views of the natural rock walls and gorge are really unbelievable. Even standing there and starring right at them still seems like its all fake. This is a must see for any nature lovers.,"October 8, 2019",Really Unbelievable,2,"Austin, Texas",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park has some really interesting views into the canyon as you drive around and walk out to the lookouts. The problem is that the view doesn't vary much, so it becomes a bit repetitive. The drive down to the floor was cool. Seeing it from the bottom after doing all the lookouts at the top makes for a nice contrast.","October 6, 2019",Interesting,181,NJ,4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,We stopped after Mesa Verde in Black Canyon of the Gunnison. The scenery s great and the movie we watched in the visitors center theater about teh history of the geological formation of the canyon and also the history of explorers was very educational. and impressive.It is quite daunting to look down and grasp how deep this canyon is ....,"October 6, 2019",impressive,88,Dubai,4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,All I can say is WOW. We were fortunate to be there with all of the fall colors on the hills as far as the eye could see. It was beautiful up against the cliffs. Enjoyed the video at the visitors center and the walks to the different viewing areas Nice day.,"October 3, 2019",Day trip,59,"Temecula, California",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon is an incredibly impressive place. It doesn’t get much recognition as far as National Parks go, and I’d go so far as to say that many travelers have never even heard of it. That’s a shame. And while it’s obviously no Grand Canyon, this is an absolute must-see if you’re driving around western Colorado. The visitor center is great, and the south rim drive is short and has several great viewpoints. ","September 30, 2019",Unsung National Park,293,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This park is one of the places my spouse & I visited during our recent Colorado trip. Since it's a national park, seniors with the senior park pass don't pay the park entry fee. It offers a lot of hiking opportunities. So I recommend wearing closed toe comfortable hiking shoes. The views in this park are breath-taking (literally for someone with asthma/COPD due to the altitude). A number of the overviews have short hikes to access them. I saw a beautiful snake crossing one of the paths to a view. I gave it plenty of room to pass since I didn't know what kind of snake it was. After that hike, I spoke with a park ranger who said that it was harmless and that the park didn't have any poisonous snakes. The restrooms are primarily vault toilets.","September 29, 2019",Black Canyon of the Gunnison,4,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We talked to several people who told us the south rim was more developed with more accessible overlooks, especially for people less able to hike distances to see into the canyon. There were some nice views. We can’t walk long distances anymore so it was fine for us. We chose the overlooks with the shorter walks to get out to them, but be aware that for people with physical limitations there are stairs, steep inclines and rocky outcrops to traverse.","September 27, 2019",South rim drive nice,8,"Oxford, New York",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,Everyone needs to see this park. Really enjoyed the drive up on the south side with all the views. Very dramatic and in some ways more impressive than the Grand Canyon.,"September 27, 2019",Must see,321,"Arlington, Texas",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I knew so little about this amazing place before visiting. It should be world famous and visited as much as the Grand Canyon - except thank heavens it isnt :) stunning, stunning scenery and jaw dropping views. Worth the price of our annual NPS pass alone. Dont miss this place","September 26, 2019",Unbelievable!,1305,"Hawkinge, United Kingdom",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,Black Canyon of the Gunnison is so impressive. The scenery alone is awesome but the history behind not only the geological formation of the canyon but also the history of explorers was very educational. Thank you National Park Service for providing those educational films at most (all?) parks.,"September 22, 2019",Impressive,57,"Topeka, Kansas",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We did the typical touristy things by driving the loop and stopping at the pull outs from the south entrance. The depth of the canyon is incredible. After a while we decided to stop at only a few places since they started looking alike. We drove down to the bottom of the canyon. That was equally as interesting. Wishing we could have seen more of the dam that is down there, but it is closed off for security. We also took the hiking path at the bottom, but from the map, I expected a more developed path. What I really would like to do is to climb down from the top from HWY 92, Hermit's Rest Trail looked very interesting. Glad I went once, but once was enough for me.","September 22, 2019",Interesting site to visit once,24,"Lehi, Utah",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,We visited from south rim and there is a lot to see from this perspective. The road goes back 6 miles from the visitor’s center with multiple stopping points to take in the views. This is a little off the beaten path so was not too crowded when we visited in September. ,"September 18, 2019",What a Nice Park ,531,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,I think you are best served entering from the south entrance. Make a beeline to the visitor center for good info and advice on how to best experience the park- amazing place not more popular only because of its geographical location - it is somewhat isolated ,"September 18, 2019",Try to enter from the south entrance ,587,chicago,4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon offers a rim road along the south rim of the canyon that includes many short hikes out to the edge. The views are simply spectacular and very unique. I would also recommend driving down the the bottom - the road to the East Portal goes off the main road right at the entrance station and it is definitely worth it, especially toward sunset.","September 18, 2019",One of the world's most unique geological formations,17,"Ottsville, Pennsylvania",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Came here on a weekday, not very crowded which was great. Beautiful views and many places to pull over and walk to a view point and get amazing photos. A must go see!Go check out the 20 minute video at the visitor center, interesting history of the park.","September 4, 2019",Great views and many view points,5,"Issaquah, Washington",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"A truly awe inspiring place of beauty! Pictures never can capture the grandeur and enormity of God’s masterpieces, but this place even more so than most. Just a few steps to either side of your vantage point and you see something new and different! One advantage to being underrated, the crowds were pretty sparse unlike many national parks! The only negative to the park is the visitors center is a little lacking.","September 4, 2019",Underrated National Park!,56,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Wow this is an amazing place and pretty unique. Can't think of anywhere else I've visited that features the dark rock here. The scenery and rock formations are stunning. At the highest point of the gorge the cliff faces are 2000 feet and there are some nice short and longer hikes to appreciate this beautiful place as well as plenty of lookout points if you just want to drive thru and view.The south rim is the best place to enter IMO as this is where the visitor centre is and the main scenic, there and back, road through the park.","September 2, 2019",Awesome!,546,"Chichester, United Kingdom",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon of the Gunnison is a stunning National Park worth the extra effort to get there. The about 5 mile uphill drive on the Park entrance road starting at elevation 6,400 ft to the Black Canyon (elevation 8,000 ft) is beautiful. The Visitor Center is small, but about right for the annual visitation of about 300,000. I did not find it crowded during my recent visit in August. Only, I wish the restroom facilities were fully developed; currently only pit toilets are available. The museum at the visitor center has nice exhibits. No food is available at the Visitor Center or anywhere else in the park. The park staff is very helpful and the ranger programs are interesting. The Visitor Center building has a wide porch on three sides, which serves as a nice prep or rest area for hikers. Hikes of varying length start from the Visitor Center. One short trail not to miss is the Gunnison Point Trail, the end point of which opens up to a grand view of the Black Canyon. The South Rim Road has about a dozen overlooks of the Canyon. The overlooks are only a few hundred yards from each parking lot. Signs indicate how far they are, but none are farther than a half mile away. Each overlook provides different views of the canyon and or the Gunnison River. The South Rim visit could be completed in about a half day if no long hiking is included. The North Rim is about a 2-hr drive from the south rim, with the last 5 miles are so on dirt road which is pretty smooth. The views at the north rim are grander. The North rim road has six overlooks, and they are much closer to the parking lots. Visiting all the overlooks at the North Rim can be completed in 2 hours. The one short walk not to miss at the North Rim is the Charm View Trail.There are no hiking paths to the river from the rims, but there are so called ‘routes’ which require strenuous scrambling, climbing on rocky surface. These are not maintained trails. Going on these expeditions require Wilderness Permits even for day visits. In summary, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is a beautiful stunning place to visit.","August 29, 2019","Grand Canyon, in Colorado",157,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon of the gunnison NP is the best national park that I have ever visited. The black canyon, so deep and narrow, made me feel dwarfed and thrilled. There are several short walk to overlooks, where you can experience the depth of the black canyon. The driving is very easy. There are not many people in the NP, even in the summer peak season, so you do not have to worry about parking space as you did in some famous parks, such as RMNP. Once again, absolutely gorgeous national park, and everyone visits CO must stop by at this national park.","August 29, 2019",Absolute Beauty,394,"Los Angeles, California",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,We had never heard of this place but found it on Trip Advisor to go and check out. So glad we did! The canyon is so deep and beautiful! We got some fabulous pictures! We drove and stopped at the lookout points. We had our 2 dogs with us and they were allowed on the paths. We also stopped at the visitor center which also has a lookout point and a neat little store.,"August 27, 2019",Absolutely Gorgeous!,31,"Boise, Idaho",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We have seen the Grand Canyon, and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and several other canyons but none like this one. You go out on the points and you are looking almost straight down. It is narrow and we could see people(very small) on the north rim. It is 2,000 ft deep. The history of the canyon is interesting. Do go to Chasm View for the ranger led talk. ONE WARNING There is no water in the park except at the Visitor center and it is trucked in. Yes the Gunnison River is there but 2,000 feet below you. Take at least a gallon of water with you per person and food for lunch. Do not be afraid to take the East Portal road to the river. It is amazing to be by the river and the road is not scary at all. It was 75 degrees but at 8,000 ft it was hot. If you can, go in the spring or fall. ","August 26, 2019",Up close and amazing,35,Texas,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We swung by here for a quick visit on our way home after hiking at Mt. Sneffles since we already have an annual National Parks pass. We were pretty tired so we just drove to most of the lookout points on the south rim and did the short hikes to the canyon edge. The longest hike from the lookouts is less than 400 yards but the views are magnificent. The steep walls and narrow canyon make it much different from the Grand Canyon, but it's still breathtaking. Definitely a must see, and will visit again!","August 26, 2019",Colorado's Grand Canyon,15,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This national park was the best one that I have ever visited. It is rated one of the lowest national parks according to some websites, and I have no idea why. There are several hiking trails and overlooks, and all of them provide absolutely beautiful views. I feel as if Black Canyon of the Gunnison is much better than the Grand Canyon, and unlike the Grand Canyon, it was extremely quiet. I recommend 1 1/2 to 2 hours to visit.Do not overlook this gorgeous attraction.","August 25, 2019","Hidden Gem, MUCH Better Than Grand Canyon",114,"Chisholm, Minnesota",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"To say that this park is severely underrated would be an understatement. Numerous overlooks over this rugged canyon - some short trails and some longer to access the rim. This canyon deserves to be as widely recognized as the Grand Canyon. It may not be as deep or wide, but holds a very unique beauty that you have to see to believe.","August 23, 2019",One of the best parks,3,"Evansville, Indiana",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"MANY years ago, we visited Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument when we had a young family. We did the rim drive. Now senior citizens, we visited again, as it is now a national park, with attention to the visitor center and the drive DOWN to the East Portal. Awe inspiring. A good video in the visitor center, and good geological explanations on sign boards at the visitor center overlook. Glad we returned to the park.","August 19, 2019",return visit after many years,1,,4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,One of the National Parks that is amazing. The visitor center is very informative.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We had a visit one day tour to Black Canyon and the black lake. It took around two hours and a half from Podgorica to the Canyon. When we arrived we paid 3 Euros as an entrance fees. We walked from the bus park to the lake around 500 metres, but we enjoyed the beautiful sceneries of the Forrest and the lake. Very clean area and easy to walk or ride a bike, even it's easy for old people to use the wheel chair.We had our lunch at a resturant with a nice view of the lake and green mountain, they offer a different kind of food but we had a fresh grilled fish and homemade apple pie with ice cream which is really delicious.","August 17, 2019",Beautiful Canyon,5,Jordan,5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,The hikes are easy and the views are breathtaking. Spent 2 days visiting but could be done in 1 day. Be sure to drive to the bottom. They had caught a bear and he was set off the road a little ways but I got to see a bear . Was heading to the south rim and a heavy rain blew in so I didn’t get to see it from there.

Awesome drops to the river below,15,"Broomfield, Colorado, United States",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I have to been many of our nation's national parks, and this is probably at the bottom of my list of favorites. We did go to the north side first, and spent most of the day there. Do not let the gravel road deter you from visiting. It is well maintained and any car could easily drive it. There were probably only about 12 cars total on the north side, so there is no problem with crowds or parking. In fact, it was a nice way to meet other visitors and have a chat. We did visit the south side, and found the views from the north to be much better. I would NOT recommend the north side for families with small children. The fencing in some areas (or lack of it) would make me nervous. I don't see this as a ""destination"" park, but it is worth seeing if you are in the area.","August 7, 2019",Worth a stop if you are in the area,3,"Boone, Iowa",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"It's not well known by many people except national park enthusiast, but I recommend a visit. The Royal Gorge in Colorado is cool, the Grand Canyon in Arizona is obviously a must stop, but this one should also make the list. The painted wall view is well worth the visit alone.","August 4, 2019","Not well known, but cool - great views",29,"Lee's Summit, Missouri",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,We did Grand Canyon last summer and this was a totally different experience. Where GC is really wide this is fairly narrow but very steep. You aren't really able to hike into Black Canyon unless you are a back country hiker (we have toddlers so that is not us). There were a few shorter trails along the rim. They were ok. We mostly drove South Rim Road and stopped at the overviews (most were a couple hundred yards from the parking area to the over view so there is some minor hiking). I personally think the best view was the overlook at the vistor's center. By about mid day parking at the various overlooks becomes a little crowded (at least in the summer) because there isn't much parking available. The park wasn't crowded the way GC was there just isn't much parking. Staff at the visitor's center was awesome.Just a note on South Rim Road it's an out and back road so when you hit the last over look you have to turn around to go back out of the park.,"July 31, 2019",Great almost unheard of park,62,"Evansville, Indiana",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Eight miles outside of Montrose is Hwy. 346, a spur road leading to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. The park contains 12-miles of the 48-mile long Black Canyon of the Gunnison River. The national park itself contains the deepest and most dramatic section of the canyon, but the canyon continues both upstream and downstream from here. The canyon's name owes itself to the fact that parts of the gorge only receive 33 minutes of sunlight a day. We chose to drive along the South Rim Drive, which features several overlooks during its course of seven miles from Tomichi Point to High Point. It is possible to hike down into the canyon but this requires permits and a great deal of skill; more than we have. The South Rim Campground is open all year, but without water hookups or dump stations.The first Viewpoint, Tomichi Point, at 8248 feet. This is the first glimpse of the Black Canyon for South Rim visitors. Most of the rim is above 8000 feet, so it is cooler. And the viewpoints all have ample parking. restrooms are at Tomichi Point and the Visitor Center.Gunnison Point is the second viewpoint along the South Rim. Gunnison Point is the most popular in the park as it lies just behind the visitor center, linked to Tomichi Point and the campground by a one-mile trail along the rim.There is a ranger led 1.5 hour, 7-mile boat tour of the Gunnison River by reservation only. The dock is 25 miles west of Montrose on Hwy. 50. It’s 232 steps down to the trail and then a ¾-mile walk to the dock. And then again in reverse. It costs $24.Two miles further along the road, the next stop is Pulpit Rock Overlook, where even more of the river is in view, as it curves round a 90-degree bend. A 134-yard trail leads to the viewing area.The park road rounds several tight bends before passing the parking area for Cross Fissures View, reached by a 357-yard path.Chasm View is one of the most spectacular overlooks in the park. A very short path descends slightly to a sizeable, railing protected viewing area above perhaps the steepest part of the whole canyon, where the cliffs fall 1,840 feet over a horizontal distance of just 400 feet. The next viewpoint, Painted Wall View, has a different panorama. Painted Wall is the highest cliff in Colorado, bordering the far side of the river; a 2,250-foot wall of rock about half a mile across. This marks the end of the most enclosed part of the Black Canyon. When you see it, you'll understand the name.The road continues to High Point, which also has picnic tables but no views of note. Most people come here for the 1,373-yard trail to Warner Point, the furthest overlook on the South Rim. This trail steps down to a saddle giving views of green fields, 1,000 feet below to the south, with the city of Delta visible in the hazy distance beyond.","July 26, 2019",Much more Impressive than Expected.,532,"Phoenix, Arizona",4

This park had less traffic than the others we visited. There are many great views within a short walk of parking areas. Our favorites were Chasm View and Painted Wall View.We hiked the cedar point nature trail at the end of the south rim road. It provided great views of the surrounding valley and of the canyon with a great photo spot at trails end.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,We visited the South Rim in July this year and it was stunning there. The Visitor Centre is good with many helpful employees and it is a short walk to various rim views. There are lots of pull ins and lay-bys along the South Rim and it really is worth while visiting each one. We saw a black bear as we drove into the Park after the main entrance gate. It was walking across the road on all fours in front of our car and it jumped up the bank at the side of the road and stared at us as it ate leaves from the bushes!,"July 15, 2019",Beautiful Canyon with stunning views,15,"Ferndown, United Kingdom",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Not very long, but a gorgeous drive (13 miles, I believe) where you can view the ""painted wall"" and ""Black Canyon"" of the Gunnison National Park. We used our lifetime park pass to get in. (Very good value if you are visiting several parks). The views were absolutely stunning and a little different than other mountains in the area. The shadows on the canyon and the variations in the Painted wall rock made for stunning photos. One of our favorites during our trip to Colorado.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We visited Black Canyon of the Gunnison on 6/22/19. We didn't start too early in the day (10:30am), but early enough that we beat the rain. We were traveling from Grand Junction to Durango, and I am so glad we took the time to stop here. You can't compare this canyon to other national parks or canyons. It is it's own beauty. We didn't have a lot of time, so we chose to only drive the south rim. Allow yourself 2-3 hours to do this drive. We took about 2 1/2 hours to stop at most viewing points, most of which had short hikes to the viewing spots. The first stop is Tomichi Point. Here the canyon looked like dark granite mountains with the greenery that sort of reminded me of the mountains I saw in Kauai. Just past Tomichi Point is the visitor's center. This was a very nice place that had restrooms, souvenirs, and a very nice walkway/wooden stairs that led out to a fantastic viewing area. The look of the canyon and cliffs changed in so many ways as we drove along the south rim. You could see the rapids of the Gunnison moving quickly down in the canyon. Also, we saw so many varieties of flowers. The purple lupine and the Yucca plants were some of my favorites. The Painted Wall was our favorite viewing spot. It is one of the highest cliffs in the US, and it is amazing to look down at the Gunnison River from there. The wall itself is so pretty with all of the patterns on it. We even saw an artist set up near there painting the amazing scenery. Cedar Point Nature Trail is a definite must stop. It actually is right next to the Painted Wall viewing area so we stayed parked in one place to see both areas. Cedar point is perhaps one of the best views in the park. Sunset View had picnic tables, so here we set up our picnic and ate lunch. Dark clouds started rolling in quickly, and then it started raining. We only had one more stop left on the drive, so we worked our way to High Point, made the turn, and headed back to the entrance station. Going back down didn't take too long at all since we had made all of our stops driving up the rim to High Point. There are so many more things I would love to have done at this National Park, but we just did not have time. I would definitely say even if you only have 2-3 hours, please visit this gorgeous National Park!!! ","July 15, 2019",2 1/2 hour drive along South Rim--gorgeous!,27,"Charleston, South Carolina",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The scenery at Black Canyon of the Gunnison is beautiful. Compared to some of the other nearby national parks (e.g., Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef), this one is decidedly smaller and it has less to do by way of walking/hiking paths. The scenery is gorgeous, though, and one visit to the vista point outside of the visitor's center shows you immediately why this is called Black Canyon. Unlike the other nearby national parks, where we spent the large majority of a day during our various visits, here, we spent a little more than half of one day and pretty much felt as if we had seen/experienced it all.Make a point of taking the short walks (varying in length from a few hundred feet to a few tenths of a mile) to go out to the ends of each and every one of Black Canyon's vista points. Every single one of them is beautiful and offers a different set of views of this lovely national park. ALL of those walks are easy to do and require no particular equipment or agility.One thing that many visitors might not know: Black Canyon of the Gunnison is designated as a national dark space, offering pretty amazing nighttime views of the stars on a clear night.","July 14, 2019","beautiful scenery, nowhere near as expansive as the other nearby national parks",77,"Silver Spring, Maryland",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Best to buy an annual pass or better yet, a senior lifetime membership if you're eligible and plan on visiting 3+ more national parks. One has to be comfortable driving the the canyon's edge when going. I'm afraid of heights but with Curecanti and several amazing outdoor destinations nearby, this place is worth the stop. A quick two hour peek at the peaks is possible if you're short on time. There are several overlooks that are within easy access for a view of the steep canyons.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This National Park is even better in person than any pictures. To see the backdrop of the 14'ers combined with the sheer walls of the canyon is an unforgettable experience. The hikes to the points of each overlook can be strenuous. There are 8 or 9 of them on the south side and range from a few yards to 347 so be prepared for a workout. Also stay on the paths as poison oak abounds. Either wear long pants or high socks, and take note if you happen to brush anything close to the ground. You could easily transfer the poison to your skin when you take your clothes off. Bring water since the elevation is around 7700 feet and the area usually has low humidity. Dehydration leads to altitude sickness, which is dizziness, headache and somtimes vomiting. Wear a hat and sunscreen due to the fact that you will be in the wide open and at this altitude is does not take much to get sunburned.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This was our first time experience with great Canyons of U.S. we drove through the south rim entrance which was well paved and not much steep. Visitor center is very near from the entrance and they have gift shops along with park information but don’t have any cafeteria or restaurant inside so make sure you have enough food with you. There are many well maintained trails which are barely 1 to 1.5 miles and worth hiking. Trails lead you to some beautiful views that should not be missed , we hiked almost every trail (devils lookout, rock point, chasm view, cedar point and Warner point- highest elevated point ), sunset view point is also there which we missed as we need to travel to our next destination. We have been there for 4-5 hours as returned in evening, night drive is highly recommended to see beautiful star filled sky which we couldn’t experience due to tight schedule.Toilets are lesser in terms of availability so make sure to use them whenever you get the chance (visitor centre) and hiking below is not recommended at all, it’s too dangerous as canyon is very deep and steep.","June 3, 2019",Breathtaking views and amazing formations,10,"Omaha, Nebraska",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"For Memorial Day Weekend, we planned to visit Black Canyon National Park – our last national park in Colorado to visit. We used Ridgway as our home base since it offered some great options for lodging and food. Also, a little quainter than Montrose. Since we were staying in Ridgway, we opted for a visit to the South Side, which is about 45 minutes from Ridgway. We started at the Visitor Center to watch the introductory movie and get some advice from the rangers. On the South Side, your options are a bit limited – either brief walks to scenic lookouts or pretty vertical hikes. We opted for the easy approach – scenic lookouts. Based on the recommendation of the park rangers, we stopped at Devil’s Lookout, Chasm View, and one other. This provided some spectacular views of the canyon. We finished off, by circling back and driving down to East Portal to check out the Gunnison River. It was great to get the perspective from the bottom, as well as learn about the now-defunct town of East Portal.I would definitely love to come back to explore the north side and some hikes. Or better yet, some rafting in the canyon.","June 2, 2019",Memorial Day Weekend in Ridgway,47,"Denver, Colorado",5

I'd highly recommend a day trip from one of the resort towns above to take advantage of the spectacular views.

The view points are enough to make you giddy. They allow you to view more than 100 stories almost straight down to the river. I felt more comfortable taking my pictures while leaning against the nice solid 2X2 foot stone pillars that supported the fence between me and the canyon. There are several TALL electricity generating dams along the river and we strongly recommend driving down to see at least one of them (no public tours inside dams or power generating stations since 9/11).","May 26, 2019",Absolutely beautiful dramatic canyon,164,"Olathe, Kansas",5

At every look out, we had it to ourselves. The sights were breathtaking. A narrow canyon with a very deep drop. It is an easy drive from Montrose. The people at the visitor center are knowledgeable and friendly. The road is very good and the lookouts well signed.

There might have been 10 other people that we saw the whole day. If you only have time to do one side, however, the South Rim offers more to see and is easily accessed from the town of Montrose.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is a relatively young national park having been established in October 1999 and remains relatively unknown and less travelled than its more famous cousin the Grand Canyon. But that ensures that any visit to this park will allow a more immersive experience that will often be quite personal with no other person to block your view or interrupt your solitude.Be sure to take the first right upon entering the park that is the scenic drive down to the river along the East Portal Drive. It only about a 20 minute drive down to the river, but is often overlooked by many travelers to the park. The drive allows you to experience the much steeper drop in elevation than seen in the Grand Canyon. The river cut a much deeper canyon over millions of years here in Black Canyon due to the density of the rock whereas the river cut a much wider canyon within the Grand Canyon.The drive along the East portal road really delivers an intimate experience with the park especially as you reach the river and sit along its bank while looking at the enormity of the canyon walls from the bottom up.Not to be outdone, the drive along the South Rim Road to Tomichi Point offers multiple viewpoints from the top of the rim down to the waters below. While you will run into more visitors on this drive it's still remarkably less than what you would experience at the Grand Canyon.You really owe it to yourself on any trip into southwest Colorado to visit this national park, especially if you are headed to Grand Junction or Ouray/Durango/ Telluride from the East. I would also recommend that if your plan to loop back to Denver on your return trip to that airport to make an attempt to also visit the Colorado National Monument. That 21 mile drive will absolutely blow you away and also tends to have fewer visitors than the better known national parks like Rocky Mountain National Park.","April 11, 2019",A Must Stop just off Hwy 50 Northeasy of Montrose,58,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This is one of our country's newest National Parks having changed status from National Monument in 1999. Since it is so new and relatively unknown and also since it is relatively isolated in SW Colorado and not near any major interstate it is really a hidden gem. We were there in June and it was not crowded at all - we found parking at the visitor center on the South Rim and at all the viewpoints with ease and on a couple of hikes ran into very few other people. That is quite different from the most popular National Parks and made for a really pleasant visit. The canyon itself is spectacular - while not as deep or as wide as some other canyons it is very steep and rugged. So rugged in fact that there are no developed trails leading to the canyon bottom, although you can hike down using more primitive ""routes"" that follow natural ravines into the inner canyon. While we love to hike we did not feel quite that adventurous but there are several trails along the top that offer spectacular views and take you away from the road and parking lot. We hiked first on Oak Flat Loop trail located right near the visitor center. Note that the name is a misnomer because it is not all flat and it does descend several hundred feet into the canyon. The trail is only about 2 miles so not very long and only moderately strenuous if you are used to hiking. We also hiked on Warner Point trail - an out and back hike of about 1.5 miles - mostly pretty flat but with a nice view of the Uncompahgre Valley and the San Juan Mountains at one point and an amazing view into the canyon at the end of the trail. We hiked this in the afternoon and it was pretty hot so if you are doing this in the Summer I would recommend doing Warner Point trail in the morning.","October 24, 2018",Uncrowded - even in the Summer,31,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5

Just amazing geology, sheer cliffs and where is the river? Way down there! Every pullout had a different look to it as the canyon has so many rock breaks. When we visited, it had just snowed, which made it very cold but beautiful. The next day, when we tried to see more of the canyon, we were able to get only so far as the clouds were low in the west and obscured our view in that area. Still, a great park to visit.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The canyon is so deep and so narrow that little sunlight can penetrate it. The massive black walls are lit up only when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, and the canyon's name is said to come from the many shadows cast on the cliff walls.The canyon's entire length is 48 miles, and the park contains 14 miles of the deepest portions of the Gunnison River gorge to a depth of 2,700 ft. At the narrowest point along the top of the canyon, the distance between the canyon walls is about 1,100 ft across, but that narrows to only 40 ft near the riverbed below.There is only one road from the South Rim to the river--East Portal Road with an average 16% grade is very narrow and steep with many hairpin curves and ends at Crystal Dam where the river is calm. A campground and picnic area invite a stop.The 7 miles long out-and-back South Rim Road follows the rim from the Visitor Centre to the end of the pavement. Many viewpoints along the way, most of which accessible via short walks. The views down the almost vertical walls of the gorge are breathtaking. Way down at the bottom is the Gunnison River with its rapids. We spent about 4 hours driving the road and walking to the various viewpoints, but could have spent considerably longer.The Cedar Point Trail is a short walk that ends with two overlooks giving spectacular views of the Painted Wall, a sheer cliff 2,250 ft high, directly across.

I attempted each lookout we stopped at and miserably failed but just being around the canyon was AMAZING. I definitely made some progress on my fear of heights so that’s good too!My husband’s favorite lookout was the Dragons. Each one was really different which was pretty rad. We also went to a ranger presentation at 6:30 in the amphitheater in the campground which was truly wonderful - 10/10 would recommend. The park is also a level 1 dark sky area and at 8 pm they pull out the telescopes (I believe W/F/Sun?).

With two million years to work, the Gunnison River, along with the forces of weathering, has sculpted this vertical wilderness of rock, water, and sky. While the North Rim provides more scenic views of the entire canyon, the South Rim provides more overlook destinations and fantastic views of the Painted Wall, which is the national park's most iconic symbol.Note:Routes to the river are extremely strenuous due to steep drop offs, loose rock, and prolific poison ivy.","September 27, 2018",This is pretty amazing to see!,1599,"Hawthorn Woods, Illinois",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon is one of those places where the power and grandeur of the planet hit you head-on. After an unassuming drive up to the south rim, there it is - a sheer drop carved through the rock over eons. The scenic drive on the south rim has many overlooks that perch over the edge of the canyon. Pause for a second and listen to the Gunnison River far below. There are a few hiking trails to get boots on the ground. Black Canyon isn't the easiest place to get to but it is well worth it, as few places show the power of water so bluntly.","September 26, 2018",Incredible,67,,5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We were advised by locals in nearby Delta to head to the North Rim first and were not disappointed. It was almost deserted (only 2 other people there). The chasm view point is really spectacular. This is one hell of a deep, dark and forbidding canton and I've seen quite a few !. Finding the road to get there was a bit tricky but worth it. The road off to it was just after Crawford state park reservoir (lake?) , heading south.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,My hopes were not necessarily so high as we have seen pretty much all major canyons in U.S. But luckily my fears were in vain. We drove the whole south rim and checked almost all lookout points....just beautiful and not too much tourists. Then drove down to river (new asphalt would be in place) and it was so cool to see the canyon from another perspective...not to forget that the river was beautiful too.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This was fantastic. We drove to the North Rim from Glenwood Springs (which is a drive that manages to be spectacular and relaxing, which is a nice combo) and couldn't believe how remote and empty it was. We parked at the ranger station and dropped off our $20 entry as it was not manned and walked to exclamation point. We weren't the only people there (we bumped into a couple walking out and a couple on the way back) but it's pretty empty. The walk to exclamation point isn't very spectacular- mostly scrub with small bushes and annoying crickets but the views at the end (and at a few points along the way) are truly stunning. The idea that a place like this is so little visited actually adds to the appeal. Great place to dispose of a body too, if that's your thing! There is a toilet and a water tap at the ranger station, which is pretty handy. Walk took about an hour and a half in total.","September 6, 2018",North Rim is amazing (and almost completely deserted),53,"London, United Kingdom",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Visited the canyon back in August (2018) and while it may not be the Grand Canyon, it will grab your attention just as much. In regards to the extreme vertical sheer drops it actually puts the Grand Canyon to shame because it's a lot more vertically straight down than the Grand Canyon. We checked out all the stops along the south rim and they all provide fantastic views and despite being so far above the canyon floor you can still manage to hear the raging Gunnison River. The visitor center is small (as compared to lodges or visitor centers as the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone), but it is all they need, providing visitors with the geologic history of the canyon, interpretive displays and souvenirs. I have heard numerous times that the more remote north rim drive is better than the south rim but if you can only do one drive through the park, I would highly suggest doing the East Portal drive to the bottom of the canyon. The views from the top are great but being along the river at the bottom is even more beautiful. It's a steep drive down but throw the car in low gear and check it out. If you do go to the bottom, you can always get your feet wet in the river but don't do it for long (seriously) as it is VERY cold regardless of how warm it may be in the summer.","August 26, 2018",An Underrated Awesome Natural Landmark,7,"Shelby, Ohio",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,This is a definite place to visit. Suggest going to the Visitors Center first on the South Rim and then driving along the rim road. There are a number of overlooks to stop at. Many of them are short and easy walks to get to from the road. They have parking areas (some small and some larger) along the road and at each overlook they have a sign that tells how far you must walk to reach the overlook so this gives you an idea of how much walking is involved.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"After visiting this week I was astonished to learn that the Black Canyon NP is the most crowd-free location in Colorado. I am not complaining about missing a crowd but, no other canyon in North America combines the narrow opening, sheer walls, and startling depths offered by the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. It is consistently among the least visited places in the U.S. Black Canyon has some of the steepest cliffs, oldest rock, and craggiest spires in North America. Well maintained roads and trails along the north and south rims have views of the Black Canyon's dramatic drops and the striated Painted Wall cliff. The winding East Portal Road descends to the river and is a must do. We saw wildlife including mule deer, elk and golden eagles.","August 16, 2018",Beautiful and no crowd!,163,"Pueblo, Colorado",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon was created by the Gunnison River over centuries and is4 very deep, steep and narrow. Most visitors see it only from the top, via the Rim Road and it is spectacular to view from the many overlooks. Some of these require a short walk and some stairs, but others are handicap accessible. You can see the river below and just image early explorers trying to find out if this area could be used for travel, a train and irrigation. With what we would call very primitive equipment these days, it is hard to think anyone surviving floating the river. The variation in color of the canyon rock walls shows the way the canyon first evolved with stripes of white that twist and turn. and there is a great NPS movie in the Visitor's Center along with a very nice book store and Passport stamp area. Photography is a challenge mid day, because the light can be very bright. But because you will viewing from the top of the plateau to the river in the bottom you can find a spot for nice shots. There is also a very narrow and winding road that heads off to the right almost immediately past the entrance gate, which takes you down to the river and a nice campground. It's very well worth the slow drive down and up, especially for close up views of the geology and the good fishing in the river. There are no food or drinks other than water, so come prepared for a picnic. A drive around the Rim Road with walks to the overview could take about 2 or more hours depending on how long you linger, but plan at least 2-3 hours for the drive and Visitors center movie. It can be very hot at mid day, but cools off in the evening. Try not to miss a sunset. The canyon is between Montrose and Gunnison with the main entrance on the Montrose end. There is another entrance at Cimmaron, East of the main Park entrance, where after a short driveyou can see the original narrow gauge train track, and the Crystal dam, one of the 3 dams, which control the water flow out of Blue Mesa Reservoir. There is also a narrow gauge train exhibt include old cars and a stock loading area. At Morrow Point, you can drive down closer to the river and walk about a mile along the river, after several flights of stairs, to enjoy a guided river trip. This boat is a fairly large tour boat, with bench seats in the center area which is covered. The whole trip is narrated by a NPS naturalist and well worth the effort to go up and down all the stairs. The walk along the river is flat and much cooler than the canyon rim. I've done it 3 times and always come away with great photos and learn more about the canyon every time. It's a bit long and confining for little kids and restless toddlers though. There are restrooms in the parking area. Even if you aren't taking the tour it is a great way to get to the river, but not for playing or swimming. Fishing is good though.","August 11, 2018","A ""new"" National Park that is often missed.",32,"Golden, Colorado",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"what a great day we had visiting. the visitor center movie is good to get acclimated and then you do spend a bit of time experiencing the park in the car. there are a couple of trails near the visitor center. the rim trail that goes to the campground is worth your time, the others not as much. as you drive from different parking points to see the canyon, you get a feel for how crazy of a natural place it is. it's so impressive how steep and rugged it is. in fact, we began to enjoy the stops with the other people who were on the same time table as we were. it's worth it to stop at all the stops as the views change more dramatically than you would expect. my regret was that we did two trails at the visitor center (the rim trail was worth it) and we missed the trail at the very end which i read was very cool. it was a wonderful, dramatic day that we won't forget. (on the way out, we went down the road that takes you down to the river and then you get a hug appreciation for the canyon from the bottom up. only takes about 15 minutes down and 20 minutes up)","August 8, 2018",wow. hidden gem for sure,17,"Baltimore, Maryland",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We visited the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park on a Sunday afternoon. It was hot and a lot more walking than we expected but worth it – the vistas are gorgeous. There are 11 overlooks on the south rim drive, most of which require a hike of a few hundred feet or more to the canyon rim. The Visitor’s Center is at the second overlook and the south rim drive totals about 7 miles in length. All of the overlooks offer stunning views of the canyon but the Painted Wall is the most impressive. We would have walked around more but for the heat. We spent about 2 hours and 20 minutes there and stopped at almost all the overlooks. The north rim drive is harder to get to and clearly gets fewer visitors for that reason. Although the canyon is completely different in geology and appearance, it reminded me of Canyon de Chelly in Arizona, in the sense that you are driving a rim road alongside a deep, steep and impressive natural wonder. There are hiking trails here too, but we didn’t take advantage of those. It only took about 20 minutes to get to the park entrance from Montrose.

From there you can hike to Warner Point about a half mile or so and will arrive and what my wife and I think are the best views in the park. Definitely worth the extra effort. You can also hike down into the Canyon but be warned that all ""trails"" down in are not truly maintained are not for the faint of heart. All would require a ton of descent and then a ton of elevation gain on your return. You also have to get a permit from the Visitor Center before doing so as they only let so many people down each day. If you're a true ""hiker"" it is highly recommended to do so.

After cruising across the flat valley of the Montrose area it’s hard to believe a cut that deep exists so close. It was $20 for the whole car load which isn’t bad. The front gate staff was very friendly. We cruised down to the visitor center and it was a little crowded finding a parking spot. But once we got parked it wasn’t crowded in the center or on the trails. You have to walk out on to the observation point! It is completely unreal how awesome the view is.

Attended the ranger-guided discussion at 2pm at the Chasm Viewpoint- that day about wilderness and definition of national parks/monuments- thought provoking. It gets hot in the afternoon- definitely bring enough water, hat, and sunglasses! Some look-outs require some ""hiking"", nothing more that about 600 yards on dirt/gravel path. Good idea to wear closed, sturdy shoes. Arrived the next morning about 7:30am to finish the remaining viewpoints- the park is open 24 hours; visitor center opens at 8am depending on the season. Morning was better for photos and plus it was cooler temperature. Attended the Geology Walk at 9am on the Rim Rock Trail. Very easy hike with multiple stops to discuss the geologic history of the canyon and surrounding area. The hike took about 1 hour. Before leaving the park, drove out to the East Portal road. Not a bad drive, all paved- driven much worse roads before. Different perspective of being closer the the water in the canyon.

The drive up was beautiful (a little scary as I was just getting used to CO mountain driving!) I must say that I was truly amazing at the vast depth of the canyon, I could not believe how beautiful it was, as well as the Gunnison river running through the canyon.

You won't regret it!. The nature walk is a bit of a hike, (bring plenty of water) but well worth the views!  We stayed two nights at the east portal campground, lower sites. There is no electricity or shower facilities and only outhouse type toilets. They lower sites are wonderfully shaded and the sound of the rushing Gunnison will surely lull you to sleep. Beware though, bears are commonly seen and do wander into camp at night! Keep all food items, when not in use, in your vechile or in the bear proof lockers.  I will definitely be going back!!","July 1, 2018",So amazing,0,,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This was quite a surprise. They allow 15 people per day to hike down. If you're in decent condition, it's a great feeling of accomplishment. It's only a mile-but all in a 1500 foot decent it's not joke. The rangers will scare/prepare you, which is wise. Half way down includes an 80 foot chain, which is pretty necessary. On the way up, you'll be relieved to stand upright if you're like us. We're a couple in our mid 50s and were able to do it (albeit slowly). Go early if you're planning to do this one. It seems they don't issue permits during the heat of the day; you wouldn't want to be scrambling up the rocks in the burning sun. We were told people often get off the route early in the ascent, so be aware of the surroundings on your way down. They knock cairns down (though we were able to follow some people left, thankfully). Know what poison ivy looks like, the bottom is covered in it. If you need rescue, they'll come to look for you the following morning, so be prepared.

We spent 2 1/2 days doing the North Rim (staying in Crawford) & South Rim (staying in Montrose which was only a 20 minute drive). A person has no idea what they are about to see until they get to a view point. True some of the views started to look like the previous one but we still never got tied of looking.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This is a national park, but not with nearly the people of other parks. It's a very special place to see. We love the Black Canyon and returned this trip once more to see it. Be aware that there are two roads you can drive. One is the Rim Road and the other is the Portal Rd. This is a very steep (17% grade) road. It goes down to the river. If you drive this road you will have to be able to drive in low gear or you will burn out your brakes. The drop-offs are very steep and the ride is not for the faint of heart. But if you do take it, you'll never forget the experience. We made the ride in our Corvette and it was FUN.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"How we never heard of Black Canyon before is beyond us. We went in the south rim entrance $20 for the car. In our opinion you can see everything at each observation Pt in a day and if in good condition, have food and water in your car you can do it in a little over half a day. Understand that each observation point is different. For most of the pts you will need to do some walking. But two of us were over 60 and able to manage everything ezceot the last Pt. Frankly for the two over 60’s in our family group they should have taken the last look out Pt after the first or second look out. Then came back to the others. The last Pt involves a over 1000 yard walk. The trail is good with stopping Pts along the way. But long. Otherwise this is a must do must see.

The only hike I did was at the end, the Warner Point Nature Trail. Very easy but gives you amazing views.The canyon itself whichever overlook or viewpoint you look at it from is stunning.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We stopped here this past summer, as we on a Colorado adventure, trying to get to as many National Parks as we could. We stopped at many of the lookouts and did many of the short trails. Each lookout gives you a different perspective of the canyon. It is nowhere as near as crowded as the other parks. It was hot and dry so bring plenty of water. The visitor center was staffed by informative and friendly rangers. They even had a demonstration with a high powered telescope so we could see the solar flares. That itself was an awesome experience. But the best experience of all was the drive back up East Portal Road. When we were about a 1/4 mile from the top, a mother brown bear and her 2 cubs crossed the road in front of us!

It is deep and very different from other canyons such as the Grand Canyon. It worked out well as I have a senior lifelong pass to US National Parks and really didn't have lots of time to spend.

Restrooms were available throughout but there was limited resources. Bring what you need to eat and drink with you. Our photographs from 9 to noon were the best of the day for canyon views. Pulpit Rock viewpoint had nice views of the river but the best views of the rock came on the Cross Fissures trail. Of the two viewpoints that follow (and are very close together) we enjoyed Rock Point a lot. A little more adventurous, some shade and shorter with a great view. To view the Painted Rock, we liked the view from Cedar Point the best. We enjoyed Dragon's Point and went back there for the sunset and to view the stars. On our way out we went down East Portal Road. The favorite part of the day. See my review there. If you're in the area, be sure to visit and try not to just drive through.

We started by driving down the East Portal Road and were able to walk along the bottom of the canyon, enjoying utter peace. Do visit as many of the viewing points as you have time for: they all provide different views.The hikes from the visitor centre are also well worth doing: Uplands Trail and Flat Oak trail are contrasting hikes although the latter is by no means flat! It took us further into the canyon than we expected, which was a bonus.People often try to make comparisons between various canyons but they are all different from each other.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This national park is not ""famous"" but if you are around the area, it is worth a couple of hours to check it out. The canyons are spectacular and beautiful and it is not crowded. If one has more time, hiking here could be fun too!We did the south rim drive after stopping by the visitor center - helpful guides. If we had known there was a ranger guided tour (and the scheduled time, singular), we would have planned accordingly. Also note that this park is part of the ""dark sky"" initiative - great place to see the stars, etc. Again, if I had done a bit more research, would have stayed at Montrose (about 30 mins? 40mins?) away and made the effort to drive back in just to see the stars away from the city lights. The drive into the park is just a flat long(er) distance away from Montrose, not too difficult (no switchbacks, etc), so driving in at night should not be too difficult with the usual care.As it was, we visited in day time, the canyons were spectacular - There were about 10 or 11 overlooks in the South Rim drive, but I don't think one needs to stop by everyone of them - perhaps 4 or 5 stops, like Tomichi (sp), Gunnison Pt, Painted Wall, Sunset View if one is pressed for time.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Having seen quite a few of the western canyons, Black Canyon is very unique. It is really deep and really narrow and yet you can still hear the river roaring through it at the bottom. The south rim road is pretty easy to get to and doesn't take all day to tour. There are plenty of turnoffs to get out and view more of the canyon itself and they are almost all on nearly level ground since you are traveling along the rim of the canyon the entire time. Watch for wildlife, they are there in abundance. The orientation film in the visitor center is informative and gives you some history about the park and the area.Finally, before you finish, consider taking the east portal road down to the river in the bottom of the canyon. This road is paved all the way down, but has a 16% grade, so you are going down a very steep incline all the way to the bottom and a very steep grade all the way back up. This is not a road for the fainthearted, either as passengers or as the driver. However, we enjoy this sort of road and we had a ball up and down. When you reach the bottom you can see where the diversion tunnel is and get a nice drive alongside the river. There is a picnic area and some rest rooms at the bottom as well. We have not found a 16% grade anywhere else on our travels and the scenery is just amazing on the road.","September 25, 2017",Now that's a canyon.,128,Chapel Hill,5

OK for mature hikers: I’ve done this many years since I was mid-60ish & learned to keep it slow and keep hydrated. Starting out I especially noted aromas: pinyon pine and juniper.

The park has lookout points where you park and then walk short distances to and from each view. If you stopped at each lookout, the walking distance would be 2.5 miles! We did not have the whole day, so we used this strategy to see the canyon. There were available hikes but they were longer hikes and we didn't have the time.

Worth the effort, wear suitable footwear & bring water.Read some reviews that mentioned lack of fencing at North rim overlooks, but that is simply not true. Just stay on the trail!

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This fee park site is out of this world. We stayed in Montrose, and from the hotel it was only about a 25 minute drive to the park entrance.At the Grand Canyon you can drink in the expansive vistas and marvel at the geologic time involved in carving out a canyon. At Gunnison, this is just dark and nasty. Volcanism is the show here, and it appears to have done its deed in dramatic fashion with speed and evil intent. The craggy canyon walls at Gunnison expose world class geology with countless pegmatite dikes lacing their way in etch a sketch fashion through sheer cliffs. No panoramic vistas here as at the Grand Canyon. What you get is a stark contrast between dark shadow and harsh light that makes capturing the incredible views on camera a lesson in futility. This has to be one of the most difficult places to photograph I have ever encountered.After spending time at the visitor center, we simply did the auto tour of the park via stopping at about a dozen overlooks. For the most part, there is sufficient parking at each location. This appears not to be an overly visited park so you have ample time to drink in the views. Make sure you are extremely mindful if you are visiting with young children. The overlooks are not for the faint of heart. These are major vertical drops with one overlook revealing the deepest canyon in Colorado and capable of hiding the Empire State building. If you have young ones, I would make sure that their hand is always firmly in my hand. The overlooks even made our teens slightly queezy. Do not miss the painted wall. One of the best geologic features at any national park. I tried my best to capture it via a photograph, and failed miserably. If you are a geology geek, this place will knock your socks off. The quintessential example of mineral intrusion via volcanic activity. There has to be gold here some where. The pegmatite just glistens in the sun casting a reddish pink hue that was simply beautiful.We also came to the park after dark to see the stars. The park is open 24 hrs and we simply drove into the park around 8pm without being stopped at the gate. Not sure when the gate is left unmanned. The sky was awesome. Huge sky of stars, but there is some interference from the city of Montrose, and we all agreed that the sky at Lassen Volcanic National Park is the best! We did see at least a half dozen ""shooting stars"". Took a while to get used to the solitude, and it took even longer to convince the teens that I was not going to drive off the cliffs before we reached one of the parking areas.Bring food with you as there is limited amenities. We just loaded up a lunch in Montrose and took it with us into the park.","September 2, 2017",The Grand Canyon's Evil Twin,196,"Havre de Grace, Maryland",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We have visited the Black Canyon twice and both the south and north rims of the Grand Canyon twice and there is no question that the Black Canyon is a more impressive sight for us. The reason is that there are about 4 different viewpoints that are outstanding, giving a colorful and clear view of the incredible vertical canyon cliff walls as well as the Gunnison river below. We visited at the end of August and there were other people but it was far from the hordes one must wade through on the south or north rim viewpoints of the Grand Canyon, The south rim of the Grand does have wonderful vertical views but you have to put up with the crowds and the problem of parking. The north rim of the Grand has amazing viewpoints as well but since the river is so far away and barely visible, the view is much less impressive. If your idea of an amazing canyon is something with vertical cliffs and a good view of the river far below, then I recommend the Black Canyon. It does not have the red and orange sandstones for color but makes up for it in the 2000 foot sheer vertical walls with interesting light (quartz?) veins and a variety of textures.","August 30, 2017",More impressive than the Grand Canyon,195,"Prevessin Moens, France",5

The various overlooks are awe-inspiring; it's worth the time to visit each one. They're well-designed and well-maintained with trails and railings, parking is exceptional. Good walking shoes are a must. We also took the 16% grade road down to the river and Crystal Dam. This is a hidden gem showcasing nature's miracle.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"One of the best ways to see this area is signing up online for the ranger lead boat tour that starts near the Blue Mesa dam. The tour lasts about two hours and rangers discuss the history and geology of the region. Scenic and educational with amazing photo opportunities! Our group floated past a bald eagle in a tree and other groups report seeing bear. It is particularly appropriate for kids, although they will be required to wear life jackets.Tip: The trail to the tour is down about 230 steps and then a half mile walk. This isn't bad at all, but coming up the steps reproduced inexplicably and the path lengthened! I recommend bringing a picnic or at least a snack to get your energy up before leaving the valley. Water is a necessity!Also - there are NO bathrooms on the boat. If you require coffee to get up and moving in the morning, know that only stinky drop zones await at the trail head and again at the boat dock. You will need to hold it or wear astronaut underwear for the tour.","August 29, 2017",Boat tour with rangers through canyon!,36,"Denver, Colorado",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,I was there last weekend and was awestruck by the beauty of this place.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This NP is not such famous as Grand Canyon or Canyonland, but it is nature hidden gem, granite miracle. Five hundreds meters very narrow slot in granite rock base, fearfully look down, where is not from any point could be seen canyon bottom or river stream. Unforgettable views of granite rocks chaos and vertical cliffs with nature painted pictures. The NP has not tourist structures as cafes or shops - as for me it is advantage. Virgin nature at 2000 meters height, deer, eagles. Don't stop only first view point - explore all canyon road including Warner point and East portal.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Unlike the Grand Canyon or Utah Canyons, this one contains Sharp Saw-Toothed Crags and peaks, not the weathered sculpted features seen in Utah & Arizona. Steep Cliffs along a winding road with no guardrails in dark narrow canyons. Spectacular Scenery not captured in photographs. We traveled West from Avon, got off at Glenwood Springs (GPS recommendation) & took 133 thru mountain valleys filled with pines and brooks & up switchbacks to mountain peaks and a lake. No gas for 66 miles once you leave Carbondale. If taking this route, you might want to go to the North Rim by taking 92 south after intersecting 133 in a small town (there is a sign pointing to the Black Canyon). The North entrance Rd is Dirt & Gravel, less traveled and about a 40 minute shorter drive than traveling to the South Rim to Montrose (the main entrance) using this route. The South Entrance rds are paved and immediately after the entrance station the East entrance rd splits off to the right down a steep winding road to the river. No traffic over 35 ft long. Going back to Avon we stayed on 50 until Grand Junction. The scenes coming back that way were mostly stark, multi-colored rock formations/mountains, also very scenic and about 15 minutes faster than taking 133/92/50 coming down.

The national park website describes the really special stops along the rim trail so you do not have to do all of them if you do not have the time. We did just the South Rim. There is little camping available and it is just before you enter the view areas. The Visitor Center is good with a nice trail behind it to a view.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This is one of the few canyons that is deeper than it is wide. Looking down more than a quarter of a mile to the river still carving its way into the gorge with the roar of the river as a constant accompaniment is stunning If your time is limited, the South Rim offers many views of the canyon that are easily accessible by car. If you can, though, take in the North Rim. We stayed at Montrose and were able to do both. The views at the North Rim are even more impressive than at the south and there are no crowds. North Vista Trail is a 7-mile out and back that is moderately strenuous with truly amazing views, particularly at the aptly named Exclamation Point. In early June there were still many spring wild flowers along the trail. Be careful at Exclamation Point, though - there are no safety fences here.","August 17, 2017",Magnificent,22,"Franklin, Massachusetts",5

It is quite a surprise meandering up towards the canyon not really anticipating the striking views that you see.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Second only to the Grand Canyon, this baby's walls go up to 2,750 ft down in some places. That's deep. And also dark, thus the name. The Visitors Center is on the North Rim, near Montrose. I highly recommend you go to the South Rim instead (near Crawford). I typed “South Rim Black Canyon” in Google Maps and it took us there. Several stops along the rim drive with fabulous views and photo opportunities. Also, check out “Morrow Point Boat Tour” (separate review) - you'll find info on the boat tour that takes you on a trip at the bottom of the canyon (plenty of steps to climb to get to and from the boat). If you access it from Montrose and have interest in history, do not miss the Montrose County Historical Museum ($6, separate review) but don't bother with Museum of the West: not only is it more expensive ($10) but it's actually a Hodge-Podge of somebody's former used goods store.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"There are many very impressive National Parks and this is up with the best of them. To say that the views are spectacular is an understatement and the history of the Canyon is equally interesting.As always, make good use of the visitor centre and if you have time, go to the North Rim (allow a full afternoon) where some of the views are even better than those from the South Rim. Especially on the North Rim, hold on to your hat as it can be breezy and if you are not good with heights you may wish to keep a little back from the guardrail/fence as it is a long. long way down.The East Portal is also worth a detour with spectacular views down to the Gunnison River as you head down and then an opportunity to see the river close up instead of from what seems like a very long way up. Be careful on the drive down, it is steep and twisty in places and not good for large vehicles.","August 6, 2017",Impressive All the Way,104,Scotland,5

I'm very surprised because Colorado state tourism has featured it in one of their commercials. There are many pull offs on the South Rim road that offer stunning views of the canyon and the Gunnison River below. Something I noticed is that there are an abundance of bathrooms along the 9 mile South Rim road (totally unlike other parks). That was a major plus for me. There are some short (less than a mile round trip) hikes from the pull-offs to the overlooks. There is one that involves walking down hill (warner point) which I passed on because I didn't want to hike uphill on my way back at high elevation and looked to be over 1.5 miles round trip. All of the pull offs provide majestic views of the canyon and river below. We stopped at all the pull-offs on the South Rim road including the Visitor Center and spent less than 3 hours in the park. Also, this park does not have an open and close time, they are 24 hour (except for the visitor's center and ranger gate).","July 26, 2017",Beautiful park that isn't overrun by people who don't appreciate it,80,"Bloomington, Indiana",5

If we'd had more time, we'd've tried the East Portal, with its 16% grades and narrow, winding roads. The Black Canyon itself is stunning. With luck you'll have a Park Ranger there to tell you about it. The Painted Wall is also spectacular. You can also enter the North Rim; it has no Visitors Center and doesn't connect to the South.

There are a bunch of good viewing points but do not miss the painted wall - it's called such because parts of the canyon wall got eroded and weathered due to time and natural forces while the volcanic deposits stood firm, turning the wall into a natural painting.Most of the good vista points have a short trail leading to it.

And this makes it feel all the deeper and more sheer. You cannot believe that a river was able to carve this. The canyon is not made of soft sandstone. It is hard Precambrian rock that feels un-cut-able.There are roads through it and hiking trails. The hikes are all beyond my ability, so I cannot comment on them. But, I have friends who say they are magnificent. There is wildlife to be seen (deer, eagles, elk and more) and you do see them from the roads.The canyon is so steep and so narrow that there isn't much sunshine that gets down in it - I think that must be why it gets its name (along with the dark rocks).This is an awe inspiring sight - if you go through the area, take the time to drive through.","May 16, 2017",Definitely a must-see,723,,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"With the main access to the canyon located about 20 minutes east of the city of Montrose, CO or about 1.5 hours from Grand Junction, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison is one of the world’s few canyons that is deeper than wide and has amazingly shear, nearly vertical cliffs; especially the northern side which is viewed from 12 overlooks along the South Rim Road. In fact, the canyon is so deep and so narrow, the bottom of the canyon at some points is illuminated by sunlight for only about half an hour leading to its name, The Black Canyon.The Black Canyon, and the little visited National Park, can be experienced in as little as 2 to 3 hours by stopping by the visitor center and as many of the overlooks along South Rim Road as time permits. While all 12 are worthwhile, our favorite overlooks included Gunnison Point, Pulpit Rock Overlook, Chasm View, Painted Wall View and Dragon Point.If one has additional time, a drive down to river level via the steep and twisting East Portal Road is worthwhile where there are picnic facilities, pit toilets and the diversion dam and tunnel whose development for irrigation of the nearby valley finally drove the exploration of this nearly impenetrable canyon in the early 1900’s. If one has even more time, perhaps on a second day, the more remote north rim, which is about a two hour drive from the south rim, can be visited via a gravel road that is passable by ordinary car.With the narrowness of the canyon, most of the views along South Rim Road get the best light to view the depths of the canyon in the late afternoon but the Painted Wall, which faces southeast, gets the best light in the morning. After visiting the overlooks of the South Rim Road in the afternoon and driving down the East Portal Road in the early evening, we stayed overnight in Montrose. We had originally intended to visit the north rim the next morning but we decided to return to the south rim to see the Painted Wall in the early morning light and revisit a couple of the other overlooks in the crisp morning air and morning sun.","May 11, 2017","Deep, Narrow, Shear",3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

Then did all of the south rim with all of the views and short hikes. Had a stunning drive to the north rim via 50 and 92 that had excellent scenery.

The South Rim Scenic Drive has 12 overlooks and most are just a short hike out to the viewpoint. I'd allow at least 3 hours but plan for more to really soak in the experience, pack a picnic, stay for a sunset, it's worth it on so many levels.The visitor center has a wide variety of souvenirs for adults and children, don't forget your National Parks Passport and get your cancellation stamp.

Take way more water than you think you will need or a water filter. Wear good boots and sun protection. Remember, if the temperature at the top of the trail is balmy the bottom might be chilly, so dress in layers and take an extra layer just in case.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"At the Visitors Center we watched a video and had a picnic lunch on an outside bench. From here we hiked on the Oak Flat Trail for approximately 1 ½ hours and had a good view of the Visitors Center perched on a ledge in the distance. Then we drove on the seven-mile long South Rim Road, stopping at 9 of the 12 overlooks. Our favorite stops were Pulpit Point, Cedar Point Nature Trail (great view of the Gunnison River), and Warner Point Trail (a view of farmland and a spectacular view of the canyon). The brochure, “A Walk With Mark Warner,” was helpful on the Warner Point Trail. During our visit we saw chipmunks, squirrels, mule deer, cotton tail rabbits, a Steller’s jay, and other birds—a lot more wildlife than we had seen in the Colorado National Monument the previous day. After seven hours, we headed back to our motel in Montrose.The park is impressive and some views were spectacular; however, it was hard to take good photos because of the canyon’s steep black walls and a lack of contrasting colors. One must visit the park in person to appreciate its ruggedness and beauty.

The canyon itself is really cool to see, with it's black-ish walls descending almost straight down like 2000 some feet, but it's also a great spot to hike down and camp. It's *extremely* strenuous, and unless you're in good-to-excellent physical condition I wouldn't even try. If, however, you are, it's well worth hiking down to the bottom of the canyon and camping out overnight. YOU MUST notify the ranger and get your permits. There's also a good chance you'll be sore and more exhausted than you've ever been on your hike up, so make sure you pack as light as possible! Its hard work, but fun to be down on the river at night and looking at the stars. Do your research before attempting this, otherwise there's actually a decent chance you could die.

The paths are well maintained. My friend who uses a walker, switched to walking sticks and found a 300+ yard (600 yard round trip) walk quite doable. Then a 700 yard one way. We didn't pack water on the walks but had plenty in the car. At around 8000 feet on a sunny, fine winter day we wished we would have started out earlier in the morning say 10 am. We heated up and if we had not put on sunscreen and wore hats we would have taken home a sun burn. There are very few visitors Off Season-all the better to secure the best viewing points for as long as you want. The off season down side: North rim totally closed to traffic.

Care must be taken, both on foot and in your vehicle to not too close to the edge of the gorge.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We had been wanting to visit the Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP for a while and we were finally able to get it organized and go last month. It was beautiful!! There are about 12 stops along the road where you can get out and go for a short walk to see the view. They were all a little different but all were amazing. You should definitely start your visit at the visitor's center and check out the view after a short walk to an lookout point. From there you can continue down the road and stop at the stops. We stopped at most of the stops but skipped a few because it was getting late and we wanted to drive to the bottom. We did go to the last stop but did not do the hike due to lack of time. Before we left the park, we did drive to the bottom for a quick peek. It didn't take too long and the water at the bottom was beautiful. Even though we didn't have a lot of time to spend, I believe we made the most of the time we spent here and were able to see a lot.

It is way better than the Royal Gorge! We only had time to view the South Rim and had to skip a few places in it because of time constraints but it was amazing and so worth the stop!!

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"4 of 5 starsvia mobile Pending reviewI visited the national park with my wife and 2.5 year old. To clarify, the black canyon is not one place you visit, see the canyon and come back. It has a south rim and a north rim drive available and this review is for the south rim that you enter through the town of montrose. It is a 7 mile drive once you enter into the park with several overlooks where you can spend time looking into the canyon. When you enter there is a visitor center where you can watch a movie showing how the canyon was formed. It runs every 30 minutes. Around the visitor center there are several beautiful overlooks where you can look into the canyon. The entrance to the park is $15 and is valid 7 days. The park is a participant of the American the beautiful pass program. So if you have it you can use it. Once inside, the 7 mile drive could take you several hours to complete. We spent about 3 to 4 hours in the park and were absolutely tired when we were done. The reason why this takes almost the same time as the 23 mile Colorado national monument is because of this important reason. Each of the overlooks at the Colorado national monument (at least for the most part) were places where you could park, get out of the park and look into the canyon and photograph. However in the black canyon, once you park at each of the lookouts you need to hike to the actual lookout to see the canyon. The views were absolutely beautiful but the walks made us tired. If you did all of the overlooks in the park, it is around a 2.5 mile hike adding all the walking you would need to do. I knocked off one star for this because even though the price was lesser ($10) for the Colorado national monument, the overlooks were easy to access even for disabled folks who would find it very difficult at the black canyon. Overall I would still recommend it but would caution you to do this when you have higher energy levels for all the small hikes to look into the canyon. The north rim drive will require you to drive around the canyon to the other side which is around a 2 hour drive to go to, a couple of hours for the driveand another 2 hours to drive back to the town of Montrose where we stayed. We did not do this as the south rim is the more frequently visited place but if you have a couple of extra days you could try the north rim.","October 7, 2016",Great visit.

I am so glad I found information on this through research before I left - It is a secret, that is just not always available. Only an hours drive from the popular South Rim, off 92, but add in time for getting lost, you most likely will miss a turn sign.

This place is amazing! The canyon is spectacular from the South Rim, and I'm told it's even more impressive when seen from the North Rim (which we didn't have time to visit). The canyon's narrow width accentuates its incredible depth, and the views of the Gunnison River almost 2,000 feet below are breathtaking.Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is not going to be for everyone. There are no onsite amenities except the Visitor Center and some strategically placed pit toilets. There is a notable shortage of fences and railings except at a few of the canyon overlooks, so this may not be the place for you if you're traveling with young children or don't care for heights. While the park is beautiful even if seen from a car window, the best views of the canyon will require walking at least a short distance to the overlooks.If you are passing anywhere near Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and have a half-day or more, you must stop and see it.

It was not crowded, so it was very peaceful. One thing I really liked is that the distance to each overlook is listed in yards, so you know just how far you have to walk. So many places say, ""1/4 mile"" and it ends up being 3 times that much, or they give you no idea how far it is. The only real disappointment was the Warner Point nature trail.

Visitors can walk as little or as much as they want. Wear good walking or hiking shoes as the terrain on the paths can be uneven. I would be concerned about taking very small children on some of the paths, though. The drive into the park is several miles long of scrubby, dry-looking plants but you will be rewarded when you get to the top! We actually stopped at nearly every lookout point and then drove back to the entrance and drove down the steep and circuitous drive to the bottom where we saw the Gunnison River close up, the dam, and the monolithic sheer walls of the canyon. There are so many places to camp or picnic, and we regretted not packing one to enjoy while we were there. Be sure to stop at the visitors center and watch the twenty-minute movie about the canyon, which will give you a deeper appreciation for what you will witness.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Not that far out of Montrose heading East on 50 is the road leading to Black Canyon visitor's center and viewing areas. It is about a 6 mile drive off 50 to the canyon, but a trip well worth taking. The views as described by others are breath taking especially when you consider how close you are to vertical drops of 100's of feet. Photographs don't do it justice. It is something that has to be visually absorbed. We drove to other viewing areas along the rim seeing one impressive view after another.","September 9, 2016",Sure glad we stopped.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon is a vast and beautiful area to visit. But you really cannot see the canyon by just driving through the area. There are numerous stops and you need to get out of your vehicle and walk to each site. The walks are any where from just getting out of your car and walking a few feet to 100 yards and up to over 1300 yards to see the beauty of this canyon. Be sure and see the canyon from behind the visitors center, Cedar Point, the Painted Wall and Rock Point. I recommend spending two to four hours in the area depending on how much time you want to spend at each point. Don't forget your sunscreen and bottled water.","September 8, 2016",An American Beauty,440,"The Villages, Florida",4

The carving of the canyon over millions of years is impressive, especially the cliffs with multiple types of rock. A geologists dream. Check out the visitors center. Be sure to take the extra 30-60 minutes to drive down to the base and the Gunnison river and dam. The driver is fun. It is beautiful there and is a great place to picnic,walk, fish, etc right on the river!","September 8, 2016","Very Impressive View, Steep Drop Offs from Viewing Area",52,"Afton, Minnesota",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The view of the vertical drop is more than frightening. I was nervous at every stop, but still amazed by the beauty of the canyon. No photograph can give it justice. One must simply have to be there to experience it. The best part was the ranger-led stargazing program. It was absolutely rewarding to see the night sky and the Milky Way. There were about 6 serious telescopes shared with us by astronomers and enthusiasts.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,Our first National Park of our summer American Road Trip. We arrived at the entrance and the Ranger was really friendly and answered all our questions as we bought our America the Beautiful Pass. The Canyon itself is just breathtaking and so deep.

They also have trails to hike if you want to. They also have a place where you can go down in the canyon and enjoy the river and the senery. There is a 16 percent grade to get down there and back up.

The Painted Wall was especially impressive, and we walked to almost every outlook to see the different geological formations.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The views are spectacular, the depth is amazing and you can get up close and personal to view this extraordinary creation. Here's what we learned: this is primarily seen by car with about 12 pullovers. We did the Southrim because it was most convenient to our travels. Stop at the visitor center to see the overlook. The visitor center also offers about three hikes for 2 miles. We should've done this because there aren't many other hiking opportunities on the Southrim except for the last stop. Another recommendation, see this at dusk. We sought in the afternoon when the bright sunlight washes out most of the color. Sunset would have made the canyon come alive. Nevertheless we are grateful for having seen this wonderful formation. Another note, our nine and 10-year-old kids loved this. They love the freedom of running across the rocks. I did watch them closely they wouldn't fall over.","August 14, 2016",Make the drive and do it!,12,"Dallas, Texas",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The sheer sides of this canyon, and the availability of pull outs and walk ups make this a great place to visit. Driving the South Rim is easier than the north, so plan a visit around where you want to go afterwards, I'd recommend visiting an hour before sunset - less crowds and better light for photos.","August 8, 2016",Spectacular,76,"Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates",5

I had no idea how big this canyon was (it is deeper than most of the more famous canyons you hear about), nor how beautiful.

We also would recommend a trip down to the river via the east portal. If you do not wish to replace your brakes prematurely, I would urge you to use 1st or 2nd gear of your vehicle and let the engine control your speed with only occasional use of your brakes. We only had a couple of hours this trip, but if we come back we are bringing lawn chairs to sit and take in the views for a whole day. Also, the short 20 minute video in the visitor center is very informative. We also spent some time with Ranger Amy who gave a good presentation on 3 different birds that call Black Canyon home.

It is hard to believe that the river can form such a deep canyon, 2300 ft. deep, yet only 25 miles away the same river flows over basically flat land. The shear depth of the canyon and the very steep walls make this such a spectacular sight. I suggest you start at the South Rim Visitors Center, which has an interesting video and diorama of the park as well as a history of the canyon's exploration.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This was an amazing place to visit. I don't know why it isn't more well known. We started with the Morrow Point boat tour, followed by the East Portal road drive. That road is a 16% grade, so extremely steep. Be sure to put your car in a lower gear. It takes you down to the river, and the area where they actually dug a tunnel through the canyon walls to irrigate the nearby area. This was done over 100 years ago with pick axes and shovels! Then we toured the south rim. There are a few handicap accessible views, but many that involve walking uphill and downhill, and steps. Each viewpoint does give you the one way distance on the sign where you park. Caution, there are many spots that have no railings, and the canyon walls drop as much as 2700 feet to the river below. I would definitely recommend this park! We saw deer, grouse, and even cattle crossing the road!","July 29, 2016",Amazing views of the canyon!,147,"Wausau, Wisconsin",5

There are hiking trails, overlooks and viewpoint areas to stop.

Take a few minutes to go down the trail outside of the center for a view that will take your breath away. I think the best time to go there during the summer is in the early morning as it is cooler and you'll get the best lighting for photos. The six mile South Rim drive is what we did. We arrived around 10:00 and were done by 1:15. We stopped at the majority of the overlooks. I wish we had taken the time to hike, but it was a very hot day. My favorite overlooks were: Gunnison Point at the Visitor Center, Painted Wall, Cedar Point (lots of vegetation to see along this one) and Sunset View (do go to the end...it is spectacular.)

Hiking can be very challenging, especially if you decide to go from the rim to the river on foot. Be well supplied and registrar with the rangers. If you do not want to hike then you can drive to the river near the entrance to the park. The Gunnison trail hike is not really a trail but a very steep path better suited to mountain goats.

It will challenge anyone to stand near the edge and peer down while the birds swoop around below you. Visitor facilities are on the south side of the canyon - the north side is a long drive around as there are no bridges across. Take in several overlooks - they're all different, attend a ranger-guided program - they're all quite good, drive down to the river at East Portal, and if you have time drive around to the north side of the canyon where you will be out of cell phone range on a dirt road with minimal facilities, but a great place to hike and see the canyon from the north side - some dramatic and breath-taking views.","June 28, 2016",This is not just another canyon,94,Frederick,5

Since we didn't have any other choice, we snagged a pass to the last route, the Tomichi Route. Well, we quickly discovered why this is the last choice for hikers. There really is no marked trail and barely a path. It's a highly difficult slide on your rear end on the way down and a mad scramble on your hands and knees on the way up! After a tortuous ""hike"" getting at most only a quarter of the way down, we took the wiser choice and gave up.We then went back and did the Oak Flat Loop Trail which intersects the original route we wanted to go. We ran into a couple at the intersection and advised them that a wilderness pass was needed to head down to the river. They said thank you and headed down anyways! Maybe that's what we should have done!Overall, we still enjoyed the Black Canyon but it wasn't as spectacular as I had anticipated.

The path ends just beyond a dock where you can take a river boat ride.From there we drove to the park entrance which is at the top of the canyon.

It is an under visited National Park and it was so nice not having the crowds of Grand Canyon and Zion . Absolutely breathtaking view. All the overlooks of the south rim are great. Easy trails to walk to and not crowded. The rangers are very friendly and informative at the visitor center.

The Devil's Overlook is a longer trip to the overlook. My husband did that while my little dog and I stayed in the car. Black Canyon is a ""DO NOT MISS"" area to see while in Colorado!

Crowds surely vary by the season, but at least in mid-April, it was easy to get around without problems, making the experience even better.

We started on the South Rim, at the Ranger Station. The next day, we drove north from Montrose to Crawford and did the North Rim. Both were fun. North Rim a bit quieter. No worries about the unpaved road ---- it's in very good condition and won't cause you any problems in a regular vehicle.

The dark rock walls and incredibly steep and narrow sides make it a must see National Park. The day we arrived it had just snowed (mid April) and that made the park even more beautiful. We drove along the South Rim Road and stopped at most of the lookout points along the way. Most of the lookouts require a walk of several hundred yards. The drive and the lookouts were fine to do in the snow. Highly recommend!

We have seen Grand Canyon, Canyonlands, Yellowstone, Sand dunes, Arches, Zion, Brice and many other parks and what we think is that each and every one of this places has something that makes it special.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I read a title of an earlier review where a man said skip if you have been to the Grand Canyon or Canyonlands. I think that is a good summation of the Black Canyon. The Canyon itself is beautiful and offers many gorgeous views. If you live in Colorado, I would suggest visiting. However, if I had to pick only one canyon to visit, I would pick Bryce Canyon in Utah over the Black Canyon.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Having been to all the NP's in Utah, we are branching out to Colorado. Located about 15 minutes from Montrose CO, Black Canyon is a must see hidden jewel! Our early April visit provided a wonderfully uncrowded visit to the park. South Rim Road was open and we visited almost all of the viewpoints. Many of the viewpoints had short hikes out to the rim to see into the canyon, the longest of which was 3/4 of a mile. Most were 1/3 mile or less. Each viewpoint provided another spectacular and different view of the canyon and pictures do not do it justice! It takes the better part of a day to see it all. The north rim appeared to be open from where we could see it from Chasm view. However it's a nearly two hour drive around the canyon to get to the north rim so we did not visit it. East portal road was still closed for the season. We were told at the visitor's center that it is controlled by the bureau of reclamation and they did not know when it would be open. Would have liked to drive down to the river....maybe next time. The visitor center staff were great. They started the movie just for us and Mike the ranger was great with the kids. Black Canyon happens to have the best junior ranger badges yet...wood instead of plastic! There were also lots of great hands on exhibits that the kids loved. Avoid the crowds at other parks and visit Black Canyon.","April 6, 2016",Must see!,112,"SLC, UT",5

Simply, Utah's National Parks nearby are far superior in nearly every ways. We hiked several short trails, none of which are particularly noteworthy.

We then snow shoed along the closed road then down just a bit til we could see down into the canyon. At first we thought the path we were on would just go down forever and started to turn back. Fortunately we found some locals who pointed us to keep going to get to look outs. Tis then a not too steep return to the Visitors Center. The Ranger at the Visitor's Center was not very forthcoming and had we not foudn the locals, we would have missed the amazing views. Well worth it in winter when bushes do not obscure views to below.

We only visited the South Rim and we drove it all, not much hiking. We stopped at all the stops and the views are spectacular from each vantage point. Some looked the same to me, but the same can be said about the Grand Canyon. We also drove down to the bottom via East Portal Road. It was so peaceful down there with so much wildlife. We were there in late October and it felt like we had the park to ourselves. There is a small visitor's center with a nice introductory film. Be sure to check it out.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I checked out Google Earth and read lots of reviews but my first step up to the railing at Tomichi Point actually took my breath away. The gut feeling you get when witnessing such incredible sights stays with you only to be added to at Pulpit Point and at numerous other spots. We just visited the South Rim as the North Rim would have required a more than two hour drive to reach. Both north and south rim roads are dead ends and sometimes are closed in winter with heavy snow. The trails we hiked in November were snow covered but passable bringing us to one amazing view after another. The Warner Point trail was the longest and most demanding but afforded the best variety of views of the canyon and the surrounding territory. November may be a bit cold for many visitors but that means you'll just about have the place to yourself. Montrose has a good selection of reasonable motels and restaurants for relief from the cold.

The north rim is ideal for those who can not walk very far as most views can be seen from extremely short walk (2 minutes to 5 minutes from car).

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,This was my 30th national park and very different from the others. The canyon was very deep and the sides were very steep. It seemed like you were on the edge of the canyon the whole time. The knife edge rock formation were a little bit like the Tetons. The rim trail was short and easy but can you different vantage points. The drive along the rim was long and if you stopped at every stop it took a long time. I would ask for the rangers opinion as to which ones were the best to stop at. It is worth the short hike out to the vantage points you decide to see.,"October 3, 2015",Out of the Way But Worth It,95,"Gill, Massachusetts",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,An easy park to visit from both sides in one day. We started at the north rim and walked the trail to inspiration point. Then drove south over the dam and up the the south rim. Be aware that the North Rim is reachable only by an unpaved road. Slow going but well packed down and worth it. The south is more traveled and has the best views. Make sure you take in Pulpit Rock for an amazing view of the canyon. Be aware that many of the points on the south rim require a walk of a few hundred yards one way. This is not much but repeated several times can start to add up. Carry water and take your time. Pick up food before you go for a great picnic with a view. ,"October 1, 2015",Small jewel,472,Indianapolis,4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We arrived early afternoon and located a camp site in BC of Gunnison NP. They have three loops, 2 with electricity and water is available in warmer months. We saw three deer wandering around and 5 grouse who were not concerned with our presence. Went to the visitor center to check out the first part of the canyon from the observation deck and lower trail. This was the evening of the Super moon shining through a total eclipse...also known as a Blood moon because of the red tint. The top at the camp ground is a zero light area and the Milkyway was highly visible. The second day the packed a lunch and drove to the end of the road past the visitor center. There were numerous pullouts along the road and with a short hike at many good viewing platforms. One stop had the highest cliff in Colorado which is almost twice as tall of the Empire State Building. At the very end of the road is a picnic area and a hiking trail which goes way out toward the end, maybe 1.4 mile hike.

There are several very short pullouts/trails to various view points. Take as many as you can. The small visitor center is very well done and my entire family enjoyed what we learned. Note: I am terribly afraid of heights. I found there were definitely some areas I just couldn't do because the sides are so sheer.

The South Rim also has breathtaking views and a Visitor's Center with informative displays and a not to be missed 20 minute video of the history of the area. The video starkly displays the enormous difficulty that the explorers had in surveying this harsh, but hauntingly beautiful area. The canyon plunges an unbelievable 1700-2700 ft. to a roaring river below. Don't miss this wonderful display of nature where the river has cut down the granite at a rate of one inch per century.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon just west of Gunnison CO easily ranks up there with the Grand Canyon in AZ and Palo Dura Canyon near Amarillo, TX. It doesn't have the vast expanse of Grand Canyon, of course, but is every bit as spectacular. Steep granite walls that plunge almost straight down 2000 feet to a foamy white Gunnison River, tree covered slopes, several areas marked with strata and striations (Painted Wall for example). As you drive along the south rim there are half a dozen or so areas to park and walk paths ranging from a hundred yards or so to nearly a mile out to viewpoints. Pulpit Rock Lookout is especially dramatic; you walk out a narrow path to a precipice overlooking a vertiginous chasm. You can only marvel at what wind and water and time can achieve.It is possible to do the Canyon reasonable justice in an hour or 2; easy to spend much longer without exhausting its potential.One of the questions Trip Advisor asks is ""Is this a good rainy day activity?""

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Though less-well-known (and much less-visited) than the Grand Canyon just over the border in Arizona, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison is equally breathtaking, and the absence of busload hordes allows for a deeper connection to the natural wonders. Accessible from both its north and south rims (we visited the south rim), this majestic example of the force of natural erosion boasts some of the most ancient rock on the plant -- pre-Cambian stone, estimated to be over a billion years old. A highlight is the Painted Wall, Colorado's tallest cliff at nearly 2300 feet, twice the height of the Empire State Building. About a dozen overlooks -- each of them worth taking -- leads to jaw dropping views that offer a reminder of man's insignificance in the face of such splendor.

After reaching the bottom, you must walk along the river about 1/4 mile to reach the NPS boat.The trip was great, very informative and up close.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I say ""surprisingly beautiful"" because I'd never heard of this place until I researched things to do in Colorado via TripAdvisor. The reviews were mostly good but somewhat mixed, we found it to be totally beautiful, very easy to get around and in fact you can drive to the vast majority of lookout points quite easily, whether you visit the more popular South Rim or take the time, which you should, to visit the less traveled North Rim. Both are wonderful and worth every minute. We hiked as well and the trails (not to the bottom of the canyon, that's only for very experienced climbers in WAY good shape!) were well marked and comfortable for a nice walk. Not like on an asphalt sidewalk mind you, no they were trails that required some effort, especially for us flat landers who do think this place has some altitude, the locals don't think so ;) It was very hazy that day from the fires in California we were told.Drive down to the river as well, yes it is quite steep and contrary to some of the reviews I read it is NOT scary, the road is steep and has lots of switchback curves but any car in good running order is going to make it down and up this road. Besides the scenery is truly nice when you get down there and there's great signage to educate you about the Gunnison Tunnel, very cool and lovely, do down there, it's worth it.We also took the guided boat tour ""Morrow Point"" which is offered by the forest service. The boat ride is just under two hours, great guides, check it out for sure, I'll write another review for that since it will be long but do consider going, worth it for sure.","August 25, 2015",Surprisingly beautiful,129,"Monroe, New Jersey",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We took a 12 day circuit from Denver around southwest Colorado. Leaving Telluride with only about 3 days left, we were uncertain which route to use to head back in the direction of Denver. The two options seemed to be going up to Montrose, and then either heading to the right towards Gunnison, or going farther north toward Grand Junction. We chose to head north towards Grand Junction, so that we could try to see both the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and the Colorado National Monument in one day. We were able to with ease.The trip up to Montrose wasnt that bad. When you get there you take a right on the main highway that crosses highway 550 and go about 10 to 15 miles to get to the park entrance road. You take a left and go about 5 or so miles to the park entrance. You dont have to go far before you get to the first pull off to see a view of the drive. We saw a deer walking around there. You then proceed along ""South Rim Drive"" (?) to the end of the road, which I also believe is the highest point in the park. There are a few spectacular view points along the way. I suppose you could draw this out if you took a few hikes and drove to other parts of the park, but you can easily do this park in under an hour. It was more than enough for us. We then left the park and headed back through Montrose and up toward Grand Junction. The scenery changes and becomes more desert like and the mountains begin to look like they are crumbling down.

However, this is simply a neat place and well worth your time. Though the review asks how long to spend here, it is personal to you. If you, are young and strong, a day is not enough.

It's less 'get in the nitty gritty' than some of the more popular tourist destinations as far as National Parks go, but don't let that stop you from seeing this amazing place. There are plenty of small trails to enjoy and short walks to overlooks. Being afraid of edges (heights) this park posed a bit of a mental challenge for me, because the enormity of it and the sheer drops, quite honestly took my breath away in more ways than one. With the exception of just one natural trail we took, all of the lookouts were well fenced, but even those took some time and courage for me to get up close to. :)The scenery really is beautiful, and the history of the river and the surrounding areas is pretty interesting as well. Something to consider - you CAN do the whole park in one day if you're hitting just most of the drive-n-park view areas -- but there is NO way to get across the gorge except for driving an hour in either direction.

We hiked the Oak Flat trail, which offers you the chance to hike down into the canyon without going too deep.

Black Canyon is the one that sticks in my memory as the most beautiful and memorable of the group. The South Rim road takes you to perhaps a dozen scenic overlooks and each is worth the time. If you are feeling adventurous and have an appropriate vehicle, you can take the East Portal Road down into the canyon to the river itself.

The reality is much bigger and more beautiful than that, and this is a not-to-miss attraction if you are traveling anywhere near the area.

This is not a huge place, like the Grand Canyon, but it is intimate yet imposing in the depth and grandeur of the Black Canyon. Therefore, the visitor center and gift shop is modest but adequate, and the various overlooks are well maintained and offer placards explaining the geology.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Easy 1/2 day visit. The viewpoints are on the west side of the canyon so pictures would turn out better if you visit in the late morning or afternoon. Most trails are short and downhill to viewing area but manageable. The Chasm and Painted Wall can be seen from the same parking lot. Don't skip Sunset point at the end of the canyon as it gives great views of the canyon transforming into a valley. On our visit, a ranger had a telescope at the visitors center allowing guests to view the sun. This park takes at least 2 hours to see the major viewpoints with no major hiking involved.

It got a little later in the day and we debated passing it by, but thankfully we didn't! We were there about the time the sun went down. Driving toward the canyon on some unassuming road in the park, we thought maybe we wasted our time -- my wife was looking at me and talking -- then I saw my first glimpse. I said 'Look over there to your right'. She literally gasped and physically jumped in her seat -- the only thing she could say was 'Oh, wow' (with reverence). We took the short walk to several of the overlooks and enjoyed every second. I hate not having more time and dark coming on.

The park is well maintained with frequent places to stop & overlook. Nice hiking trails interspersed throughout as well. We hiked a number of the shorter trails - all beautiful & well maintained.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon was one of the stops on our Colorado road trip and we were impressed by the beauty of the canyon. It was only 20 minutes from our hotel in Montrose, and is definitely worth a visit. We drove the South Rim Drive in the afternoon, stopping at each viewpoint. Some of the viewpoints were just off the road and others were a bit of a hike, but nothing that was too far. Vault toilets were even available at some of the viewpoints, which is a luxury compared to many other national parks.Visibility of the last few viewpoints was difficult due to the position of the sun in the late afternoon, so we ended up coming back the next morning to see the last few viewpoints. When we stopped at the visitor's center on the way out of the park, one of the rangers had a telescope set up so that visitors could look at the sun. It was fun to look at the sun spots that the ranger pointed out.While the Black Canyon was not the our main reason for visiting Colorado, we are really glad that we decided to visit the park.","July 7, 2015",Enjoyed our visit,100,"Detroit, Michigan",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We have passed the exit to the Black Canyon many times and finally set our minds to visit. We were not disappointed. The South Rim Road takes you to multiple vistas that seem to outdo the last! The trails take you very close to the edge so you can get wonderful views down into the canyon. The vista trails are all dog friendly (must be leashed), so you can take your pet with you rather than leave them in the car. You can easily do the South Rim in a day trip, but add another day if you want to do the North Rim since you cannot access it directly from the South Rim. There are bathroom (vault toilets) facilities at most of the view points. Although it was the middle of summer, there never seemed to be a lot of people, so you could enjoy the views without being rushed by someone behind you. The East Portal Road will take you down to the river and the Gunnison Diversion tunnel, a lot of interesting history is given on the building of the tunnel.","July 7, 2015",Hidden Gem,99,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,My wife and I were advised to see the Black Canyon National Park while traveling in that area. The Park Service did a fantastic job of building observation platforms and safe trails down to them. The views are astonishing. Looking down approximately 2700' to the canyon floor is amazing. The Gunnison River runs through the canyon and is cool to see from so far up. The different rock formations and types of rocks offer wonderful and colorful views of the canyon walls. There is a visitors center there where light refreshments and snacks can be purchased and Wheel chair accommodations at some of the overlook sites. Black Canyon is a definite place to visit and see.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Upon the advice of a B&B owner, we elected to visit the less busy North Rim, which is accessed just south of the Crawford Reservoir on Hwy 92. The views are amazing, with well fenced look outs over the vertical cliff walls. We paid our $15 access fee at the ranger station. We were in a rental Ford Fusion, a four door sedan. We had no issues with the gravel road, and saw some smaller rentals also on the North Rim, so don't let the gravel road dissuade you!Bring in enough water and food for your visit, as there is nothing available on the North Rim. There are toilets at both ends of the trail, perfectly fine, but not running water toilets. You will definitely need sunscreen. The canyon is amazing, my kids were awed.

I loved the peaceful quality of this side of the park - there was only a few other cars! We checked in at the Ranger Station and met the VERY nice and helpful ranger there, then decided to do the 1.5 mile hike (3 miles total) in to ""Exclamation Point"" before we drove to see the 4 mile scenic road. The hike was easy (though hot that day, so wear a hat, and bring extra water) and what an amazing sight greeted us at the end!! There is simply no way to describe looking down into that steep, dark canyon. So stunningly beautiful.

Impressive overlooks into one of the narrowest, steepest and deepest canyons of America (almost 2800feet vertical cliffs). Several view points along the rim drive, whereof Chasm view and Painted Wall view are my favorites. It was pretty cold beginning of june and sometimes we got even snow … not abnormal at 8000 feet high.

This is a really well kept park very clean and nice rest toilets, I think the reason it looks so clean and nice is because it is a newer less known and visited park.I think everyone should add this to their bucket list, but at the same time I love that it is kept so nice from the lack of visitors compared to the other parks.We went to most of the viewpoints and headed out when it was getting dark, and then went back in the morning for the sunrise.Some parts of the canyon it's so deep that you could almost fit the Empire state building into it twice, now that's crazy.We were able to check out the visitor center as they opened Saturday morning and then unfortunately had to leave.This is an incredible place, pictures don't do it justice.","June 13, 2015","One of the best National parks in the U.S, it's incredible.",417,"Camas, Washington",5

The drive to the canyon floor on the East Portal is for the more adventuresome. It is steep (about a 16% grade) and falling rocks adorn the highways from place to place. But it is well worth the trip to the bottom. Having seen the Grand Canyon, Bryce and Zion parks, and other rock formations, this one is different from all the others, which makes it worth the visit.

The Colorado drops over a mile vertically as it runs through the Gunnison granite formation.The resulting water flow rate is responsible for cutting such a deep canyon across such a narrow span.

Then we traveled up to the North Rim where some of the locals in Gunnison had told us we would enjoy the views. Let me just say, I have traveled all over the U.S. and this is one of the most spectacular areas/views I have ever seen. It was ""jaw-dropping"" spectacular, with cliffs soaring up to 2000 ft., the river below is narrow and beautiful, and the overlooks are literally hanging over these beautiful scenes. If you have problems with heights, you may struggle some. The roads are narrow and have no railing - the road literally drops off cliffs in some areas. The overlooks can be a challenge too. I could not have taken my children up there when they were small; I would have been too nervous to enjoy it. Again, absolutely spectacular.

If the safety issues are dealt with I would give it a 5* rate.","May 11, 2015","Beautiful park, take extra care with children",64,"Hereford, United Kingdom",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The canyon is not really black: late in the afternoon this park is nearly empty and the sun hits the walls and gives it a colorful tinge. Several lookouts, some from the visitor center, provide incredible views of the Gunnison river from its sheer walls. Some are right on the edge! In early May the river had an aquamarine tinge, and the trails were already dry. There are two entry points - the South Rim (closer to Montrose) would be a perfect way to get acquainted. Hiking to the bottom is feasible but would require about 4 hours and some route finding.","May 4, 2015",Deep views into sheer canyon walls!,88,,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We had never heard of this park and wouldn't have had we not done some investigating into what was available besides the Big 5. Wow. I am I ever glad we found this amazing park. It's so different from the others. No little town to fight your way through. No parking problems, no people.The park itself is almost ethereal. The entire canyon does appear black, but in a lovely way. The views are outstanding. It reminded me in some ways of the volcanic canyons in Hawaii, but on a much larger scale. They offer two scenic drives. The South Rim Rd. is pretty, a very easy drive with great vistas. It's about 7 miles long and is paved. It offers about 10 or twelve overlooks, some of which you must walk to get to. The signs posted by each, do list the length of the walk. None were very long, all were worth it. The other drive is the paved East Portal Rd. Wow. Be prepared if you start out. You can't go in anything over 22 feet in length. It's extremely steep with 16% grades. There are many, many hairpin curves. This was without a doubt the best scenic drive we took in our roadie of over 6,000 miles. We did it in our Corvette which is a car made for turns. I'm not so sure I would have done it in a big, standard size car. If you don't know how to downshift into 1st or 2nd gear, forget this road as you will burn out your brakes. Both roads can be entered immediately upon entering the park. For the extreme route take a right, for the other proceed through the park. Please have a tank full of gas before coming here. On our entire trip of the park we only saw two other cars. It was fantastic to be able to enjoy such a beautiful place virtually alone with nature. Don't forget about this park if you journey west. Oh, don't forget if you're a senior that you can use your National Parks Pass for free admittance.","April 23, 2015",Outstanding,681,"Sebastian, Florida",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"BLACK CANYON OF THE GUNNISON NATIONAL PARK WESTERN COLORADO-THE FORGOTTEN PARK  (COLORADO’S HIDDEN BYWAYS V) In the vastness of rugged Western Colorado, there is a place that was lost, and now rediscovered. This is a place where the land is old, a place where the colors of immense ancient cliffs meets the eye in every direction. A place where the land speaks to the mind through shape and shadow, and the wind whispers of ages past and present. This is a very ancient place, where time has stood still, while the relentless river did its work. This is an area where the dust swirls through the canyon walls and eagles soar, while the mind creates fanciful images among the ancient vertical canyon walls framed against the stark western sky. This place is BLACK CANYON OF THE GUNNISON NATIONAL PARK, a land of discovery and mystery. Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is located in the Southwestern section of the state of Colorado. The canyon itself was cut by the Gunnison River over eons of time, forming this immense, high walled gorge. The power of the river continues to cut down into the canyon today, although somewhat tamed by the dams that were built upstream. If you have never heard about, or visited, this unique National Park, you must budget some time into a trip and visit ii. Unlike the Grand Canyon, with its wide spaces and vistas, The Black Canyon of the Gunnison is narrow (rim to rim) and over 2000 feet deep. The ‘Black’ in the title is caused by the ever present, ever changing shadows that are so prevalent in terrain of this type. The Denver & Rio Grande Railroad used a portion of the lower canyon to the east as a scenic right of way, dazzling their passengers with the beauty of the region. Access to this National Park is via CO US50, a few miles from the outskirts of the town of Montrose, CO. You can also access the wonderful park from the north via SR92 from the Crawford, CO. This makes access to this relatively complex National Park easy. The beauty of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is that it centrally located between Durango and the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad to the south, as well as Colorado National Monument, farther north.  Our first question was lodging. We found that the town of Montrose, Colorado was ideally suited for our needs. It is about 15 miles west of the initial turnoff for SR 347N from SR50E, which is the access to the park. There are a number of excellent establishments located off US50 in Montrose that have excellent accommodations, as well as nearby restaurants that will cater to your tastes. Excellent lodging establishments are also located in the Gunnison, CO region if you are approaching from the east. There are a number of approaches that can be used to access the park.  From the town of Montrose, Colorado: travel east on NM US50E for about 15 miles. You can also come west on US50W from the beautiful Gunnison valley and the great town of Gunnison, CO.  If you are coming east from Montrose, Colorado, as we did, proceed east for about 15 miles on US50E, making a left onto SR 347N at the marked sign for Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Proceed up the switchbacks onto the Vernal Mesa for about ten (10) miles. You will be on private property and ranchland as you approach the park. Please respect these property lines. You must pay your National Park fee at the East Portal entrance station before entering this park. You will find the entrance to the campground a short distance (on your right) once you have passed the entry station. Advanced reservations (970-641-2337) are required for space in this campground. It should be noted that large vehicles and trailers over 22-feet can run into difficulties on the approach to and on the South Rim Road, due to many turns and parking considerations.  Stop at the Visitors Center to get your map, and get oriented. There is ample parking at the Visitors Center for many vehicles. Spend some time at the Visitors Center, exploring the relics of that ancient Native American group that hunted here. Get a map of the canyon and discuss the viewpoints and history with the ranger staff. Take a look at the pottery and artifacts that are on display and marvel at their complex designs and patterns. In addition, take advantage of the rest rooms. You may have to return here if nature calls. Furthermore, be sure you are wearing appropriate footgear and are carrying water. There are some of rough trails leading to outer viewpoints. If you plan to hike down to the Gunnison River from the rim, you MUST register at the Visitors Center/Ranger’s Station, The trails going into the canyon are notoriously steep, rocky, contain loose material, and are considered strenuous. If you plan to use these trails, you MUST be a fit hiker with experience on steep trails. You also must be self sufficient, with the proper gear, food, and water. Remember, in most cases, the route out is an uphill and was your route in.I have found the late morning, early to mid-afternoon (i.e. four to five PM) lighting to be excellent for photography, depending on the viewpoint visited. Therefore, I will be making photographic recommendations pertaining to the available viewpoints, as well as time of day.  DO NOT DEFACE OR CLIMB ON THE ROCKS OR ITS SURROUNDINGS. YOU ARE ON FEDERAL PROPERTY, AND IT IS AGAINST THE LAW. LEAVE IT THE WAY NATURE INTENDED IT TO BE LEFT! Before proceeding, I would like to make mention that MOST of the viewpoints are situated well away from the access South Rim Road. Ample parking is provided, but be prepared to walk from your vehicle to the viewpoint on will marked rim trails. The average round trip walk, which I would consider EAST to LIGHTLY MODERATE, is about 1/3 to 1/2 miles. Heed the footgear warning and keep away from the edges of the canyon. It is a long, long way down, and they cannot bring you up by mule (“SOME LIKE IT HOT”-1959). SINCE THE ONLY RESTROOM FACILITIES ARE IN THE VISITORS CENTER AREA OR THE ROAD TERMINUS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU USE THEM! YOU DO NOT WANT TO FIND YOURSELF IN NEED OF SAID FACILITIES AND HAVE TO USE A BUSH OR ROCK, WITH A SNAKE OR LIZARD LEADING THE CHEERING SECTION AND INQUISITIVE CRITTERS TAKING PICTURES OF YOUR POSTERIER FOR POSTARITY!  I will now present the viewpoints in the order of appearance as you travel up the South Rim Road toward the highpoint of 8289’, along with photographic tips. My starting time was about 9:30AM. Please keep an eye on the weather, because afternoon thunderstorms can rapidly envelop you. PLEASE NOTE; THE SUGGESTIONS GIVEN BELOW REFER TO THE BEST VIEWING TIMES FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC PURPOSED. IF SHADOWS ANS LESS THAN IDEAL PHOTOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS DO NOT BOTHER YOU, FEEL FREE TO VISIT THESE VIEWPOINTS AT ANY TIME. a. TOMICHI POINT OVERLOOK- This is a fantastic viewpoint (see image) on your right that you will encounter shortly after the entrance station. The viewpoint is located on the side of the road (parking area), so little walking is involved. The lighting at this time of the morning was poor, due to the fact that the viewpoint faces east and the canyon is in heavy shadow, giving a blue cast to your images. RETURN HERE AFTER ONE PM. b. GUNNISON POINT OVERLOOK AND THE SOUTH RIM VISITORS CENTER: Gunnison Point is another east facing viewpoint that requires some steps and walking in order to get to the viewpoint. Stop at the Visitors Center and take care of any business, including the aforementioned facilities. There are some rim trails beginning in this area. The lighting at this time of the morning was poor, due to the fact that the viewpoint faces east and the canyon is in heavy shadow, giving a blue cast to your images. RETURN HERE AFTER ONE PM. c. PULPIT ROCK OVERLOOK: This is one of my favorite overlooks (see images), especially when looking east. This is a walk in, walk out set of viewpoints with about 1/3 to 1/2 miles of walking to the viewpoint(s) and back to your vehicle. The view down to the Gunnison River far below is great. Spend some time here.  The lighting at this time of the morning was poor, due to the fact that one of the viewpoints faces east and the canyon is in heavy shadow, giving a blue cast to your images. RETURN HERE AFTER ONE PM. d. CROSS FISSURES VIEW OVERLOOK: This is a beautiful overlook with two viewpoints, a western exposure and an eastern exposure. It is also a great place to examine the very bones of the canyon, the rock walls. These overlooks require about a 0.5 mile round trip walk from the parking area and is a must see. Spend some time here and get the measure of the canyon.  The lighting at this time of the morning was poor at the eastern viewpoint, due to the fact that the viewpoint faces east and the canyon is in heavy shadow, giving a blue cast to your images. RETURN HERE AFTER ONE PM. e. ROCK POINT OVERLOOK: We got to this wonderful viewpoint at about 11AM. The lighting on the canyon walls at this point was wondrous, with fleeting shadows and colorful canyon walls (see images). These overlooks require about a 0.5 mile round trip walk from the parking area and is a must see. Look down at what appears to be a tiny stream at the bottom of the canyon and realize that it is the Gunnison River. Linger here, and remember the wonder of this point.f. DEVILS OVERLOOK: A nice overlook, similar to Rock Point. If you have to choose, go to Rock Point.g. CHASM OVERLOOK: You have now reached the scenic high points of the south rim. From here, and the next viewpoint, you will get fantastic views of the PAINTED WALL (see images), which makes up the opposite canyon wall. This immense wall is over 2400’ high, making it the highest continuous wall in Colorado. The lighter wavy lines on the wall is made up of lighter colored Pegmatite that was injected in its molten form under pressure into the surrounding matrix eons ago, when this land was volcanically active and buried under thousands of feet of material. This wall was first climbed in the 1970’s due to its technical difficulties. This is a morning place and is about a half mile walk from your vehicle. You need the morning light reflected on this beautiful wall. Spend a lot of time here and marvel at what nature has created. On the way back to your vehicle, you may find some unofficial viewpoints of the wall. Approach these with care, for you are near the rim and the fall is endless. In addition, you may find some interesting Pegmatite outcrops near the trail for you to examine.h. PAINTED WALL OVERLOOK: This is the other viewpoint that you must linger at. The walk to the viewpoint is short, but the rewards are great (see images). The description of the humongous natural wall is given above, so I will not repeat them here. The morning light views are beyond description, with the wall appearing almost grey/pink with the uneven lines of the intrusions meandering across the surface. You can almost reach out and touch this wall, even though the wall is over 0.5 miles away. Spend some time here, since one may not pass this way again. i. CEDAR POINT OVERLOOK: You are now swinging away from the Painted Wall, with some beautiful views of the Gunnison River in its bed and the hills to the west (see image). You can see that you are now losing altitude and the river is coming out of the deep canyon, There are two viewpoints here, with a total walk of about 0.3 miles roundtrip from you vehicle.j. DRAGON POINT OVERLOOK: This overlook is similar in many respects to Cedar Point. Go to Cedar Point Overlook if you have to make the choice.k. SUNSET VIEW OVERLOOK: A rather large, west facing overlook that is similar to Cedar Point and Dragon View. The advantage to this viewpoint is that it is near the road, requiring little walking, contains a picnic area, and has restroom facilities. The view is to the west and the end of the canyon.l. HIGH POINT TRAILHEAD: This constitutes the end of the road. The is a delightful trail called the Warner Point trail that travels about a mile each way, terminating at west facing Warner Point. For those of you who have skipped viewpoints in order to obtain better lighting, it is time to go back and do, or redo, those sections.  Enjoy your time in this National Park wonder, and be sure and visit all that you can in the timeframe that you have allotted for this trip. Depart by returning to CO US50 East or West, or visit the more visited areas of this magnificent treasure, which preserves the natural relics of the past for future generations.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This National Park comes across as an overlooked attraction and has a kind of off-the-beaten path feel to it. Perhaps this is because I almost drove right past it while road-tripping, or the intense popularity of parks like Rocky Mountain and to a lesser degree, Great Sand Dunes. However, it would be a shame to miss this attraction and I believe a multi-week trip to Colorado would be incomplete without visiting this incredibly narrow and steep canyon. This is truly a spectacle of geology and is incredibly intimate in comparison to the Grand Canyon.

North rim and East Portal steep road to canyon floor are not open in winter. Ask for all of the printed guides at the visitor center, as there are 5-6 different ones, not just the main park guide.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Most people have never heard of this national park (recently upgraded from a national monument). That's a shame, because it's a true national treasure to rival many of its more well-known counterparts. It is off the beaten path, but if you can make it to the area DON'T MISS this canyon. Its remoteness means there are fewer visitors so it's not as crowded as the more popular parks. The views of the sheer canyon walls and deep crevice canyon with the wild river in the bottom are breath-taking. There is a scenic drive that is less than 10 miles long, with several stops for viewing the canyon. Some of them require a short hike (up to a 1/4 mile one-way, hard-packed dirt and rock trails). There is a very nice, new visitor center with a viewing platform, exhibits, restrooms and gift shop. There is no restaurant at this park but there may be snacks at the gift shop. There is not a lot of shade and the sun is intense at this elevation; be sure to bring hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. For people in wheelchairs or with mobility impairments, the best stops are at Tomichi Point, the visitor center, Chasm View, and Sunset View. Allow a minimum of 2 hours - all day if you really want to hike and explore. There is a fee to enter the park, but they do accept the national park passes.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is a park that I would assume would not be high on the list of National Parks visited. It is about a 20 minute drive from Montrose, Colorado. Unlike the Grand Canyon, Black Canyon of the Gunnison is a very narrow canyon, but reaches 2700 feet deep at its deepest point - as a result, little sunlight penetrates the canyon casting shadows on the walls, hence, the name Black Canyon. It can easily be visited within one day. The south rim drive has several scenic stops, and most require a short walk to the canyon, but the walks are easy. Be sure to listen for the sound of rocks falling from the walls as they tumble to the canyon floor. A moderate one and one-half mile round trip hike to Warner Point is worth the vistas it provides. A five mile descent down East Portal Road takes you to the Gunnison River at the base of the canyon, but it is not a drive for the feint of heart. The road has multiple switchbacks and a 16 degree grade. We did not make it to the bottom as my wife panicked halfway down thinking we would not be able to get back out of the canyon, so I turned around and returned to the top.

The Black Canyon is FAR more impressive! I guess the Grand Canyon is known for how wide it is - whereas the Black Canyon is known for how deep it is. It is the depth of the Black Canyon that makes it so spectacular. It is absolutely breath-taking to be peering down the side of thousand foot rock cliffs into the narrow but furious river below. Spend some time hiking around and breath it all in. We've been hiking on the rim and have driven down into the canyon to walk along the Gunnison River as well.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This was a re-visit to Black Canyon of the Gunnison Nat'l Park...yes, it is worth visiting more than once (as are ALL National Parks, in my opinion). Cost (fall of 2014) was $15/vehicle, good for 1 week. Views into the canyon are awesome (keeping in mind that we've also visited the Grand Canyon, AZ, & Waimea Canyon on Kaua'i). Comparatively, Black Canyon is VERY narrow, so more of a ""straight down"" view than an expansive (Grand Canyon) view. The colors are totally different too, more black/gray/pink at Black Canyon (as opposed to the red/orange of Grand Canyon or Waimea Canyon). The drive along the S rim offers great views, & EVERY viewpoint area is worth a stop. Likewise, it is worth driving down the road that goes all the way to the Gunnison River at the bottom (& there is a small camping area down there). There is a small Visitor's Center, & also a small camping area (you make reservations online) along the rim drive. There is an out-&-back hiking trail that goes along the ridge & affords nice views of the area, which we hiked on a previous visit...can't remember the name of it, but you access it from the parking lot at the end of the rim drive road (the 1 that has all of the viewpoint stops; you can ask at the Visitor's Center). On a previous trip we also visited the N rim, which hardly gets any visitors & is very primitive. There is no bridge connecting the S & N rims, so it is quite a drive to get to the N rim. We wanted to do some primitive tent camping, so it was worth the drive for us, & we had the entire camping area to ourselves. There is no food available in the area (either rim), so bring along a picnic lunch (there are picnic tables scattered here & there along the S rim drive). You can do a really quick drive-thru on the S rim, just hitting the viewpoints, in a couple of hours if that's all the time that you have...but it is definitely worth a more leisurely pace, including a picnic lunch, & spending at least half a day on the S rim. If you want to also see the N rim, you can do that in conjunction with the S rim, but you will need to start EARLY & it will be a long day. Black Canyon of the Gunnison is definitely worth a visit, even if you have to go out of the way a bit to get there.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"After we stooped at the visitor center for an orientation, we did the usual rim drive - our favorite overview was at Painted Wall. Then we did the slightly strenuous two mile loop hike from the center 400 feet down into the canyon. As this park is close to a small urban area, there were many school children here that day. We have heard about the very strenuous ""routes"", not hikes, to the bottom of the canyon that require a permit. But we found it much easier to take the road to the right at the park's entry kiosk down to the bottom. There are some spots with a 16% grade, but we found it not so hard to make the trip in our Honda Accord.

We first stopped at the visitor center and watched the video history of the park which was nice to know. Due to time constraints we only did the south rim drive. We stopped at all the major overlooks and found them all to be stunning representations of this beautiful national park. We were there on a Saturday and the park was not very busy at all.

We had our two dogs along and this Park lets you take the dogs on a leash to the vista points, which are 200-300 yards from parking space. The road to the bottom is worth doing but the non-driver needs to agree to not critique braking necessity and is NOT for those prone to motion sickness.

The dam is very interesting. Then we went topside and visited all the stops with Dragon Point being my favorite. We saw only two other vehicles while driving around. With the sun setting, the canyon walls were beautiful. Definately the best time to check out the South Rim is in the late afternoon/evening. Two evenings later we checked out the North Rim. It was definately worth going! All gravel roads on the North Rim and no one around! We took our chairs and sat and watched the views as the walls changed.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This is an amazingly beautiful part of the American West! Spent three days exploring this area while on a recent visit to Colorado. We are active hikers and were able to make the one mile ""hike"" into the canyon via the Gunnison trail. This is only recommended if you are in excellent shape and have no fear of heights , steep descents or ascents. The ""hike"" was grueling, the most difficult one mile I have ever experienced but oh the reward. The canyon and river are amazing, beautiful unspoiled and oh so quiet. This is truly a place to get away from everyone and everything.Below the rim is a designated wilderness area and the park only allows 15 individuals a day to enter so if you do make this hike the reward is one you will share with a very limited amount of individuals. The rim drives are definitely worth doing and everyone should take the opportunity to make the short hikes to the lookouts to grasp the beauty of this wilderness area.","September 2, 2014",One of the best kept secrets in the National Park system,32,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon is amazing and such a surprise to see in the area. The views are breathtaking. The park from the South Rim is small. You can drive out and back in under an hour (without stops). If you have time to see it all, it is breathtaking (but at times redundant). If not, I recommend definitely seeing the viewpoints around the Visitor's Center, Pulpit Rock, Chasm View and my favorite - the Painted Wall. These are the most breathtaking points on the South Rim drive and pretty varied. I'd skip the Devil's Overlook though. It's a long walk for the same view you can get in other places.The Painted Wall is what you see in most of the pictures. It's spectacular.A word of caution -This is not a park for small children. Not at all. There are several areas where there are no barriers, just sheer cliffs. Even when there are barriers, they are fairly small and limited. So I would not take little kids here, or even unruly teenagers! It's a sheer drop off the cliff and probably one of the only times I'd advocate to put your child on one of those leashes you see at Disney World.","September 1, 2014","Beautiful and breathtaking, but for adults.

The drive down to the river (no trailers or long RVs) is ""fun"" and offers another perspective of the magnitude of the canyon's depth. It's a nice cool place to picnic and has bathroom facilities.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"There are 3 (absolutely) ""must do(s)"" in Colorado... (regarding National sites)*Rocky Mtn. Nat. Park*Mesa Verde Nat. Park*and this place.. Black Canyon of the Gunnison (or BCG from here on out)BCG became a national park in 1999.. but before that it was a national monument. It also gets it name cause the canyon is like a slit in the earth and the interior only gets a few minutes of sunlight per day. I went to school in Boulder and my roommates were from Paonia. One of them brought me here and I was in shock to see such a deep canyon that was also so narrow. If you ever found yourself at the bottom of the canyon.. consider yourself trapped.. like forever.I returned in Aug. 2014 and I am still awed by this site. This time I took some time to really explore the place and had a wonderful time.There really are two entrances.. the ""South Rim"" which is Hwy. 347 off Hwy. 50.. and most people use Montrose as the nearest town.. for motels, food and supplies. The other entrance is on the ""north rim"" which comes down from Crawford on Hwy. 92. You will get a great view from either side... but the drive between the two is like 2 hours. The visitor center on the South Rim have a lot of activities and I recommend you looking into them. There are several stops on the road that parallels the canyon's rim.. so you will get several great views. The water moves from South to North.. and eventually empties into the Colorado River, which you know goes on through Utah .. etc.when you go to into the park on the South Rim entrance go to the visitor center and see the 20 minute film.. it's well worth it. If you have questions.. the staff IS the best in Colorado.. well, maybe Rocky Mtn. NP crew is just as good. You don't want to drop your camera here.. lol. and if your hat blows off.. well kiss it goodbye as well. Though the wind rarely gets very strong.. a stretch cap is recommended over the hat or other loose fitting ones. Any kind of shoe is fine also.. as the trails are well defined. However, some trails are dangerous and tough and you should talk to the rangers about them first. This is not a place to take chances. As for pants.. shorts are fine as not many insects nor kneeling. (Many places don't list the 3 important items.. hats, shoes and pants.)A brief history about the BCG is in the film.. which tells of the desire to traverse it via rail.. lol.. and how it was surveyed for water usage. Geologically, the area is a raise due to lava flow from underneath and volcanic debris which fell from above. With the soil being soft, the water started to run off and cut the deep gorge you see today. The water is all white water and moves very rapid. The grade is 95 feet per mile.. comparing that to the Grand Canyon's 7 feet drop per mile.. and in most places in Colorado.. the drop is less than 10 feet per mile. If you didn't know.. I am a rockhound.. meaning I chase rock and geological formations... and if you do the same.. know that you're about to enter rock heaven. You could spend a week here and just scratch the surface. Talk to Zach at the visitor center and he will give you a tour. Now should mention that most of the rocks are on the ""East Portal Road."" Be careful if you take this road.. it's not to be played with. the grade is 16%. let me repeat that number.. 16. Considering that the most the Interstate system allows is 6-7%.. 16% can really do damage to cars. You really should run in low gear and go slow. coming back up is not fun for the car either. But if you do take the road.. stop along the way and check out the rock croppings.. I found garnets and peridots/olivines in abundance. Lots of malachite, pyrite, crystals, etc in the schist and marble material. The place is a geologist's dream. (I should say there are other places in Colorado that deserves attention.. like Dinosaur Nat. Park, Colorado Monument, etc.. but they are not on the level as RMNP, MVNP, and BCG).If you stay in Montrose.. negotiate with the Black Canyon Motel for a great deal on a room.","August 13, 2014",One of the top 3 in Colorado.,136,"Osceola, AR",5

I feared the Black Canyon of the Gunnison might be similar but I was so so wrong.A totally awesome drive along a spectacular erosion feature through fascinating rock layers with quartz banding in all directions.

The Canyon is so steep that we did not see trails down into the Canyon (unlike the Grand Canyon in Arizona). It must be spectacular at different times of day and seasons.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This is definitely a very pretty national park to visit if you are in the area, but I was a little disappointed. Maybe the comparisons to the Grand Canyon had my expectations set too high. It is definitely no Grand Canyon. But, like I said, it is a very pretty place and I loved how you could hear the river’s flowing waters high above at the viewpoints. We took the South Rim road on our visit. We were there in the early afternoon in mid-July and just be aware that it can be a little warm at that time. Early morning would have been a nicer time to visit. A few other comments: There is only one entry station and it is staffed with one person, so if you get a person in a vehicle ahead of you that is asking a million questions, be prepared to wait. By the time he/she was finished, there were at least 10 vehicles backed up waiting to get in. Also, there are only 2 toilets (unisex) at the visitor center. They definitely need more. Both times we stopped at the center, there were 6-7 people waiting to use them.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We stayed at the south rim campground. There are 3 loops and spots at 2 of them can be reserved. We camped with a motorcycle and tend. The spots vary a bit and are all quite large but not all of them have shade. It get's pretty hot out here so bear that in mind. Our spot was in the A loop. We liked it but there is really no view. You have to walk to trail to the visitor center. That is awesome and now you will be able to see what this park is all about. Vistas. We also drove the south rim road and stopped at most look outs. Fantastic. This NP is less known as some of the others in the west but definitely recommended. From here you can continue to Durango and take the million dollar road up into Colorado or take the road from Cortez to Telluride, a wonderful little town in the mountains!","July 22, 2014",Black Canyon of the Gunnision Campground,85,"Chatsworth, California, United States",4

Plan for a day, since the drive with stops for photos (be sure your driver get's his/her chance to see the sites) can take some time. We only did the South Rim road, but my understanding was that was the major part of it. The road down into the canyon was having 2-3 hour delays due to roadwork.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We visited this National Park twenty years ago, and came back again when we were in the area this year because it was so lovely. Both times there have been very few people visiting; it obviously isn't very well known outside the area, which is a shame because the overlooks are easy to get to, the views are breathtaking, there are a numer of guided walks with rangers, including walks for the disabled, the Visitor Center is easy to get to and there is a good film about the Canyon there, and you can spend as much or as little time as you want exploring. This is a wonderful place, as impressive as the Grand Canyon in its own way, that more people should see, and it only costs $15 admission.","July 20, 2014",Fantastic National Park,41,"Quincy, Illinois",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This seems to be one of the less visited National Parks, as we found it not crowded at all at the height of the summer tourist season. It is a wonderful canyon with breathtaking overlooks, AND you can actually drive your car down to the floor of the canyon. The drive is not for the faint of heart, however, as one of the grades is 17%. The entire road to the river and dam is paved, so you do not need 4 wheel drive.Ranger talks and guided walks are scheduled several times a day, so check the website in order to time your visit. Allow at least 2 hours to drive the entire rim loops and down to the canyon floor if you intend to take photos. A stop at the visitor's center to watch a short video and get maps will enhance your experience. Be sure to take plenty of water and wear suitable shoes (closed toe walking or hiking shoes. No sandals or heels). Be sure to watch your children closely, as there are rocky ledge overlooks with no guardrails in places.There are restroom facility at various locations, although some of them are pit toilets (no water). Hand sanitizer and extra toilet paper are recommended. No lodging except tent camping (1st come, 1st serve). No firewood available for sale and gathering it is prohibited.There are many trails for hiking. Kayaking is for experienced kayakers only. Rock climbing is allowed, and visitors are warned not to throw anything from the rim overlooks, as climbers may be below. Admission is $15.00. If you are 62 or older, you may purchase a National Parks pass which will admit you to this and other National Parks.","July 18, 2014",Breathtaking geological features,596,"Austin, Texas",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We only had a few hours here and could have spent the whole day. At the visitor center, we happened upon a nice volunteer ranger ' Bernie' who had this awesome telescope through which we were able to view a sunspot on the sun! The visitor center had some nice displays and there is a nice short hike right out the back door with great views. We were lucky as well to come in time for a ranger-led educational talk on the geology of the park with 'Paul'. He had us do a 'demo' of the types of volcanic activity with pancake mix, it was fun and very informative. We always try to take advantage of these ranger-led activities, they are always very informative and make the visits to the parks all the more meaningful. We drove the South Rim from the Visitor Center to the end and did the Warner's Point hike which was about 1/3 mile one way and got to see lizards and birds along the way. (Be sure to bring some water). The views at the point were breathtaking as well. The Painted Wall, everything was well worth the time we made to come here. You can spend a short time or a whole day here. It's $15 per car to get in but we bought the National parks annual pass ($80) since we like to go to some other parks too. Seniors get a really good deal on annual park passes. Do make the time to stop here if you're anywhere nearby and check the website ahead of time to find a ranger-led activity in case you can coordinate your day to go to at least one. Be camera ready and binoculars would be great too! Be aware that this area has very limited wi-fi / cel signal and you should check this out before you leave your hotel or residence so you'll have a signal to get to the website.","July 13, 2014",Takes your breath away!,122,"Longmont, Colorado",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I've done quite a few hiking trips in the past couple of years. This one was probably the one I'd rank at the bottom. I've never had a terrible experience at a park but this one was mediocre.I did the south rim only so this review is for that.Let's get the good stuff out of the way, the views are great. Not as fantastic as many other areas of Colorado, but certainly very nice. Some places to sit are quite relaxing and wonderful. You'll get a few good pictures out of this place.The hikes are all really really short. Not a challenge at all. There is one 1-2 mile one at the end of the road that I didn't get to finish for time reasons. Pretty interesting view there.Herein lies the problem. I went in spring and so all the flowers were blooming. I ran into so many bugs, I am not sure exactly what they all were but they all looked like bees and such. So that was disturbing. Also, they were on so many of the trails. After the second flower-ridden bee-infested trail, if I got out of my car to stop and saw a bunch of bright flowers on a trail I'd just go right back to my car. I would go if the flowers were a decent distance away.I stopped at every stop and went down the one really steep road and back up. The entire experience was about 3 hours. I actually did considerably MORE than I planned in the time I allotted for this trip to the park despite skipping a couple of the stops due to the bees.I was on a 2 week long trip through Colorado. If you are doing a similar Colorado drive, my suggestion is unless you are a camper or plan to do some of the longer hikes, to skip this park, and in fact to skip Montrose totally. There is a boat tour nearby that may be good, I don't know, it was closed when I got there. But if you are contemplating where to go on your Colorado road trip, this should be low on your priorities. It is pretty neat but not as satisfying as many other things such as driving up Mount Evans, or going through Independence Pass, or going up one of the fourteeners, Rocky Mountain park, or any of the other amazing things you can do in Colorado.If you have the extra 15 or if you can split the entry costs and you are a photographer, certainly you should come here but don't spend a lot of time.","July 5, 2014",Not my most favorite place I visited on my 2 week trip,116,"New York City, New York",3
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"So pleasantly surprised at this park. The views are stunning and the visitor center was very nice. We started our boys on the Junior Ranger program, and they loved the booklets and the swearing in by the rangers. The rangers were enthusiastic and knowledgeable and our boys are very excited to continue to earn their junior ranger badges at the other parks we tour. We hiked the oak flat trail, which provided great views but was perfectly manageable for our boys ages 5 and 7. We only had an afternoon here, but would have liked more time. Lots to see!","July 5, 2014",Beautiful!,46,"Bellevue, Washington",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This park has a north and south rim but to get from one to the other is an eighty mile trip. The south rim is easily accessible from Montrose CO. The road is fully paved and most view points are short walks from the turnouts. Each view is outstanding but we especially liked the Painted Wall view. The entrance fee is $15, valid for seven days for both rims. It appears that most people only ever visit the south rim. You are however missing out on THE most spectacular views if you miss going to the North rim, especially the Chasm view which is quite different from that same viewpoint on the south rim. The North rim drive is on an unpaved road but it is easily accessible even with a saloon car. Be brave and do not miss this outstanding natural wonder. If you are going to do both rims, then make sure you drive from one to the other on the Blue Mesa scenic route ie from Montrose take the 50 to Blue Mesa Dam and then the 92 to Crawford. Also take two days to appreciate both rims. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison is a hidden treasure not to be missed.","July 3, 2014",A must see,203,"Scotland, United Kingdom",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"If you like your national park with all the amenities, such as restaurants, gift shops, and fancy lodges then this park is NOT for you. If you want a quiet park without a lot of tourists and still wild then this is for you. As I have a fear of heights I thought I made a mistake in coming here. However, the park was quiet and it's astronomy evening programs are worth seeing, especially the telescopes set out by the rangers. It is not a highly developed park, so you will have to go outside the park for firewood, ice and food. Plan on spending time driving 2-3 hours from one rim to the other as there is no bridge over. It is worth going to the Curecanti Recreational Area (right next door and free) to get to the bottom of the gorge. Go to the Pine Creek Trail as it will take you to the river and you can follow the route of the old railroad. Also take the Oak Flat Trail off the visitors center as it takes you to beautiful views of the canyon, but not near the scarey cliffs. It is marked strenuous, but really is moderate. We camped here two days and really loved it!","July 3, 2014",Quiet wilderness,61,"Rapid City, South Dakota",4

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Grand Canyon in Arizona is perhaps my favorite spot on the planet — especially at the very bottom, to which my wife and I have hiked many times. The problem with the Grand Canyon is that it is so grand, so vast, that it's almost incomprehensible and in any case, most of it is inaccessible to the normal visitor. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison in Colorado, on the other hand, is comprehensible and accessible. Visit all the observation points on the road on the south rim and you'll get a pretty good and pretty complete view of (almost) the entire canyon. You'll see a lot if you do nothing more than walk out to the observation point from the excellent visitor's center. It's not a hiker's paradise by any means, but we hiked a fairly easy and pleasant trail from the visitor's center and there are others. And it's always worth getting down inside any canyon whether it's Black Canyon, Grand Canyon, Palo Duro (near Amarillo) or anywhere else. So it's nice that, at Black Canyon (as at Palo Duro), you can actually DRIVE down to the bottom. We went down and got a very interesting walking lecture from Ranger Tom about the construction of the dam and the water diversion tunnel. It's a fascinating story and I recommend it.I want to emphasize that Black Canyon, while it ain't the Grand Canyon, is still a very impressive hole in the ground! The north rim's wall's are much steeper than those at the Grand Canyon and from rim to river, Black Canyon is (if memory serves) still about two-thirds of a mile deep, i.e. about two-thirds as deep as the Grand Canyon. We camped in campground C and had a good time. It's a wonderful place if you're interested in birding. I also wish that I had had time to learn more about the canyon's geology.I see that someone else suggests that Black Canyon isn't worth going out of your way for. We were there for two days, and I think I might have started finding it difficult to know what to do if I'd hung around a third day. But even so, I thought it was a worthwhile spot to visit. On the same vacation, we also headed up to another of our favorite spots, Rocky Mountain National Park. But we went out of our way to get to Black Canyon and I am very glad we did. I'd like to visit again sometime and also explore more of the area.","June 18, 2014",Beautiful and intelligible little sister of the Grand Canyon,46,"Dallas, Texas",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"WOW!! This park is so worth visiting! It's small, but I could have easily spent more time. I stopped at most overlooks, and hiked the 2-mile Oak Flat Loop trail (not flat, BTW). I also took the drive down to the river portal. In retrospect, I'd skip that and do a few more overlooks - a few were a bit of a hike to get to, so I skipped them to save on time.","June 17, 2014",Wondrous!!!,43,"Sacramento, CA",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"It's not a substitute - not a competitor or worthy challenger to the Grand Canyon.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I visited Black Canyon of the Gunnison as part of a tour of the national parks of the Colorado Plateau. It was probably the park that I had heard least about before my trip, so I was surprised that it turned out to by one of my favorite parts of the trip.On my first day, I started out hiking a loop formed by the Rim Rock, Uplands, and Oak Flat trails. . The trails were very pleasant, with frequent spectacular views of the canyon. There were remarkably few people on the trails, so it was very peaceful and quiet.In the afternoon, I drove to many of the scenic overlooks along the main park road and hiked the Warner Point Trail at the end of the road. The canyon is stunning with steep cliffs on both sides making a very deep, narrow canyon. One of my favorite things to do was just sit and watch as large birds of prey (sorry I don't know what species) soared below in the canyon while smaller birds whooshed overhead.On my second day, I decided to be a little more adventurous. I started out driving to the nearby Curecanti National Recreation Area and hiking the beautiful Curecanti Creek trail down to bottom of the canyon. The trail was not easy (900 feet of drop over 2 miles), but it was not so difficult that a reasonably fit person couldn't handle it. I would definitely recommend this trail for anyone who does not feel up to doing one of the steeper draws down the canyon inside the park. After hiking the Curecanti Creek trail, I drove to the north rim of the park. There are no developed trails down to the bottom of the canyon in park itself, but there are several “draws” where you can navigate down to the bottom with a free wilderness permit. I did the S.O.B. Draw down into the canyon. This was one of the craziest hikes I've ever done. There is a trail leading to the place where the descent into the canyon begins, but after that, I was really just looking for a way down without injuring myself. Much of it was climbing down rocks and occasionally sliding down steep dirt patches while holding onto nearby roots and rocks to slow myself down. At the bottom, you are rewarded with a closeup view of the river, which was a very dramatic area of rapids, and the canyon above. After enjoying the view for a while, I started the trip back up. Although the climb up did not feel as perilous as the trip down, it was definitely a challenging cardio workout (1800 feet of vertical climb over about a mile) even with frequent rest breaks. I would not recommend a trip down the canyon for everyone, but if you're in good shape and are pretty fit, it is definitely a fun adventure. I spent my nights camping at the South Rim campground, which was pretty nice. It was typical of a national park campground in that it was nice but lacking amenities of more expensive campgrounds.I'm not sure why this park doesn't get as many visitors as many of the other parks in the area, but I am grateful it doesn't. The stunning scenery with no crowds made for one of the best national park experiences I have ever had.","June 14, 2014","Stunning Scenery, Fun Hikes, No Crowds",26,"Akron, Ohio",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We did the south rim drive and stopped at several of the overlooks. Most had a short walk to see the canyon, but a few were a little longer. We stayed a couple of hours. We had a hard time coming up from Durango. There is a road closure south of Ouray that is not mentioned on the National Park website. We squeezed through at lunchtime when they open the road for an hour. The closure is about 20 miles from Silverton. Even without the closure, the road is very difficult, but it is a beautiful drive.

Be sure to check out the Gunnison Diversion Dam and tunnel entrance (after watching the film) and follow the footpath along the river. When you're back up top again, take the South Rim Road.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The scenery here was very impressive. There are several observation points where you can get amazing views, but I would recommend hiking to the base of the canyon if you are in good enough shape to do it. You have to get a wilderness permit to hike into the inner canyon; the permit is free, but you have to listen to a several minute talk about how potentially unsafe it is before they'll give you one. It is a very steep hike with a lot of loose rock. It took about 3 1/2 hours to hike down and back up, with a lot of breaks for taking pictures.

For anyone who has visited the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, or Canyon de Chelly, to name a few - Black Canyon is a remarkable contrast. More like an immense gorge, brooding and haunting, it's like no other national park. We took a pleasant drive in from Montrose, where we stopped to pick up a picnic lunch. (The visitor center offers only water and trail snacks). Every stop along the south rim drive provides spectacular vistas. We watched a golden eagle soar while rock climbers made a daring ascent on the opposing ridge. The powerful waters of the Gunnison were quite audible even up high! We were so energized by the raw, natural beauty and peacefulness here (not as crowded as other parks) that we took the Warner Point hike at the end of the south rim.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We took a daytrip from the town of Gunnison to the Black Canyon. This was our first big mistake. It is a VERY long drive and there are several places where extensive road work is being done with long waits. Because of the terrain, there are no alternate roads and this construction is going on for most of 2013. The better idea would have been to stay closer to the park. Then, there are barely any services along this road - especially gasoline. Once in the park, there are NO services at all except for a visitors' center. Aside form poor planning on my part, I still must say that this site is not quite as spectacular as I have read. I'm not sorry that I got to see the canyon, but there are many amazing canyons, cliffs, mountains and gorges throughout Colorado that would easily equal this site.

We were able to walk to the very front at the look-out points we chose . We drove down the East Portal Road, which is steep but not too scary.The area around the dam is pretty.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,I will be brief since I reviewed this national park two years ago. We were on another road trip in Colorado and were close enough to Black Canyon to stop again. The views into the canyon are both so magnificent and spooky at the same time. The drop is around 2000 feet to the Gunnison river that flows below and the views are often straight down. Fortunately there is usually a fence that keeps you from falling into the canyon. There are several viewpoints from which to peer into the void below. From parking places you usually had to walk for a couple of minutes to get to the canyon's edge for the views. One that was perhaps the most popular was just in back of the visitor's center. The name comes from the fact that the canyon is both so deep and also so narrow that it is often so dark that you cannot see much from some points. As a result be there at mid day for the best views when the sun is as directly overhead as possible. There is a very nice visitor's center with a really great film that deals with the human history of the place. It was very worth watching. We drove on to follow the river toward the east where a dam has been built which brought you right down into the canyon floor and next to the water. It had several picnic tables and bathroom facilities.,"October 7, 2013",Just as unique and wonderful on a second visit,766,Minnesota,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This National Park is like a mini-Grand Canyon.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,Did not expect such a beautiful place. The visitor center is very nice. The rangers helpful and exhibits good. Watch the film if you have time. Then you step out on the back patio and it is outstanding. So many places to take breath taking photos. On the drive there are several pull offs and walks out to the drop offs. Take water with you. It can get hot. My only down side was the restrooms. They were awful. No water to wash your hands so take wet wipes with you. If you have a National Park Pass for seniors use it here for admission.,"October 1, 2013",What a Nice Surprise,61,"Kansas City, Mo",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,This park is very beautiful and magnificent. There are many trails to hike all the way to the edge of the cliff. Soon you will learn the reason it is called Black Canyon because the peak are so steep and canyons between peaks are so deep that sun never shining into and it remained dark most of the time.The park is small enough that one to two hours are enough to drive through. I will recommend to spend more time and follow some of the trails to admire some of the scenery.,"September 20, 2013",What a park,26,"Hollis, New Hampshire",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We have been traveling the midwestern and western US for many years now. Somehow we never got to the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. So this summer we decided to give it a go.Our host Jim, at the Four Mile Creek B&B (Reviewed by me separately) made us promise him to do the North Rim first, which we did.It was one of the best recommendations we have ever had!!The North Rim of the Black Canyon is at the end of a good firm dirt road and is signposted on Rt. 92 slightly south of Crawford. As promised by Jim, we were there all alone. We first drove to the Chasm lookout point which was absolutely magnificent!! So were the rest of the lookout points along the rim drive.The canyon is deep, cut into black rock with pink granite veins running through it, creating beautiful painted walls. The following day we did the South Rim Drive. It is also amazing, but the views from the North Rim are indeed more spectacular. Also, the South Rim is where the tourists go.....The visitor center is definitely worth a visit. Be sure to see the short video describing the early adventurers and prospectors exploring the canyon at the turn of the 20th century.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,Breathtaking scenery awaits you at The Black Canyon of the Gunnison. We spent an evening and half a day here exploring the different scenic look out points and then making the drive to the bottom. A full day would probably be enough time to hit the highlights but if you want to hike and take your time then maybe 2 days would be better. We camped here too so I'll review that separately.Definitely see the spot behind the visitors center and see the film shown inside the visitor's center. If you can't stop at all the spots along the drive then make sure you see the Painted Wall - absolutely gorgeous!

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I had been to Colorado once before but hadnt heard of it. While planning my trip i ordered the Colorado Vacation Guide and didnt even notice it mentioned. Planning my route on the map i saw it, looked it up online, and realized i should stop here. The first few people I talked to had never been there before and had no idea how amazing it was. Just goes to show how amazing Colorado is that this place is way down the list of attractions, where if it was in my home state of PA it would be #1We drove the south rim in the morning, so the lighting wasnt great for pictures, but just a variety of spectacular views. Wish i had budgeted more time but the couple hours we spent was enough to at least get to all the lookouts. hope to return to Colorado when my kids are older and more into hiking to expand our adventure.","August 29, 2013",This place needs to hire a public relations firm,28,HAVERTOWN PA,5

Enjoyed the Movie also. The next day we explored the canyon on the Gunnison River on the NPS Morrow Point Boat Tour. We had another fabulous day. The steps were fine. We expected them to be more difficult. It was a lovely walk to the boat ramp along the river. The boat tour was awesome. Fantastic scenery & a very informative presentation by the ranger.

I live in South East Texas about 25 miles from the Gulf of Mexico...there are deer around here, but you are more likely to see an alligator.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"If you are anywhere close to this park, you must see it. We were on a driving trip near Gunnison and almost returned to Denver without seeing the canyon because it was somewhat out of our way and would add a few hours to our trip. Luckily, I came to my senses because of course you never know when you will pass a place like this again.We drove to the north rim near Crawford, on a rainy summer day, then ambled down the somewhat long, isolated road that take you on a gravel road for about six miles. It was absolutely worth the time and effort. The ranger's station here is small but there is a nice campground and a short nature hike with amazing vistas of the canyon that literally took our breath away. We also went on the driving loop, which has five overlooks of various geologic features. You cannot drive to the canyon floor here--only the south rim route--but I didn't want to drive down a steep grade anyway. The view from the top was awesome and offers spectacular views of the river.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"On our way to Montrose, we have passed the signs for this NP several times. This trip we did some research online & made up our minds to visit. We took the South Rim route, as it was more accessible & close to our destination. We stopped at the Visitor Center, where the staff was helpful in giving us some pointers if we wanted to see only a few viewpoints. (Our time was cut short due to road construction delays on US Hwy 50.) There was a lot of information on the walls, a video presentation, a scale model of what the canyon looks like from the air with all the viewpoints both N & S rims indicated. I particularly liked the wall mural that gave the details about the feet per second counts as the water travels through the Canyon. Plus the changes in elevation & how far the water level drops in the short distance of the canyon & how much Faster than by comparison to the Much Longer,1,500 mile length, Mississippi River, from headwaters to the Gulf of Mexico.Upon leaving the V.Ctr. we decided to drive out to the Sunset View first before making any other stops on the way. Then we could choose which stops we wanted to make on the way back, & better gauge how much time we would take after each one. So we saw different portions of the canyon as well as widely different topography. We stopped at Dragon's point, where the walk was 100 yards. Here we could see some of the Painted Wall landscape, as they told us would at the V. Ctr. The opposite wall has varying color striations of Black, Grays, Pinks, Creams in a sometimes zig-zag pattern. You can imagine why they call it the Painted Wall.Next we stopped at The Chasm pull off, but opted for the nearby Painted Wall view for 2 reasons. 1) The walk was shorter (it was getting quite warm) & 2) we were just in time for a Ranger Talk. He was describing the explorers who took tourists on rides in the Gunnison River through the canyons. Taking more photos of the scenery as he spoke, we were glad we had stopped at this location, again as suggested by the V.Ctr.Lastly we stopped once more at the V.Ctr to use restrooms, before departing from the park. One more stop at Tomichi point allowed one last look at a very different view of the Canyon. Also great photo opportunities looking both directions.We were able to get a good cross section of views in about 1.5 hours. The FAQ's suggest one should give themselves from 2-3 hours to do just the South Rim. Should you desire to do the N Rim, be advised there is no CROSSING of the Canyon & you would need to Allow an additional 2-3 hours to travel to the other rim & see it's overlooks.See the NP.gov website for detailed information about this very interesting & different Canyon & River system. If you are going to be heading on US 50 anywhere close to Montrose, CO -- I would highly encourage you to make plans to include time to visit this NP treasure!","August 2, 2013",It's Worth the Trip...,69,"Tupelo, Mississippi",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I agree with most of the reviews in that this is a great National Park. It is like a smaller version of Grand Canyon, and I was satisfied with my 4+ hour tour of the park. The signage in certain places can be poor (i.e. I thought I passed the visitor center because of the way the signs were displayed). Also, it would be nice if the trail heads were marked a bit better with distance and difficulty. The best and worst of this visit was the drive. I cannot believe they do not have people driving off into the canyon when it seems that budget cuts in our Federal Government seem to not want to pay for guard rails. The views are incredible, but the person driving better not look at any of them!!!I took my family (includes 3 teenagers) on the Warner Point Nature Trail. This was a very nice trail of moderate difficulty. The views are excellent, and change drastically depending on which side you are meandering through. I would say that this would be a good trail for children 8 years and above.","July 29, 2013",Excellent Views. Crazy Drive.,86,"Mebane, NC",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Approach either from the South side near Montrose or take the beautiful back roads to the north side outside of Crawford, either way is spectacular. The South side road is not too clearly marked so a little attention is needed. There are a few tourists who know about this edge, but I think it is more beautiful then the Grand Canyon. You can see more and get closer and really experience the magnificence. There are ways down to the river, on foot, that take about 4 hours down and 6 back up. I'd recommend taking either a guide or another experienced rock climber with you. Don't try it alone. Fantastic picture opportunities everywhere.","July 29, 2013",Worth the trip from any direction,15,"Colorado, United States",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We took about 3/4 of a day to do this National Park. We stopped at the visitors center first, which was very informative about the history and geology of the Canyon. It's not just another canyon, by the way, it's very different in geology and it's history with humans. The south rim road is approx 12 miles one way and has lots of stops to look at different views of the canyon. The views were all amazing and rich. Because it is smaller and somewhat out of the way, it wasn't too crowded or difficult to navigate for a national park.Considering the money goes to the Park Service, I didn't complain about the entry fee. I consider it money well spent. Seniors get a significant discount with a lifetime pass. If you are nearby, stop and see, it's worth the time.","July 22, 2013",Beautiful and interesting,34,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Don’t miss this National Park on your visit to Colorado. It will amaze you. The surrounding area gives no indication as to how magnificent this canyon looks into you arrive at the visitor center. Before venturing out to all the pull overs, watch the short video in the Visitor’s Center. It’ll give you an appreciation on how the park was discovered and its history and purpose today. Also be sure to take the drive to the bottom of the canyon as well. It is steep (16 %?) but we made it down in our Toyota Camry in a lower gear. Go slow and pull over when needed to cool the brakes. To be at the top of the canyon and look down and then again at the bottom looking up is amazing. Note: We only located pit toliets in the park; no flush toliets.","July 22, 2013",Don't miss this!,75,"Iowa City, Iowa",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"What a scenic place this is, once you get in. The cost of entrance was pretty steep in my opinion, $15. It is good for 7 days, but that won't do us any good. It would be nice to simply see a cheaper day pass. Regardless once in, we started on the scenic overlooks on the south rim. The first few are of the open gorge which was cool. I'd recommend to keep going to the other overlooks because they do get better. My favorite was of the Painted Wall. It is basically a flat piece of the mountain that has all different patterns from molten seeping into the surface millions of years ago! I'd also recommend taking the curvy road down to the water. The drive down is steep, its 16% grade but we managed just fine in a small Kia. There is a visitor center with more information about the park and rangers there.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"In July 2013 I did a tour of National Parks: Great Sand Dunes, Mesa Verde, Canyonlands, Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison and Rocky Mountain.Black Canyon is rather one dimension in it's appeal, perhaps the most one dimensional park in the entire system. It's a Canyon and a rather small one in terms of acreage. However, the sheer ruggedness in which this Canyon carves into the earth is rare. The deepest section of the Canyon is 2,722 feet deep, but it is very narrow and very steep.To truly experience what this National Parks are all about, you must go to the river. If you are physically capable that is. I am a personal trainer by trade and in better shape than your average hiker, though I am not an endurance athlete, more toward the strength side.Anyhow. I began my descent at 2pm after talking to a very helpful ranger who gave me a good background on the hike. Average time is 1.5 hours down, 2 hours back up. You have to fill out a wilderness use permit so they can keep track of how many people are down there. I started down. Quickly you hit a series of exceptionally tight and steep switchbacks. I am 6'3"" and 31 years old for reference and it took me awhile to get my bearings, I was very slow and VERY cautious to begin. Every step I felt like I was going to fall. As I climbed down I looked back up and realized how difficult this was going to be coming up. As I reached the area that has a chain to assist in climbing down, a young man from a nearby town and an older gentleman around 50 passed me (the older gentleman had just summitted 3 fourteeners in the previous week).I had initially planned on only coming partway down since I wanted to head up to Rocky Mountain National Park the same day. However, the further I climbed down, the more I realized this was a special experience. This wasn't something I could find maybe anywhere else. This was a challenge. There was no way I was bailing on this.The young man said he liked to ""jog"" down and it took him about 20 minutes down and 30 back up!! I have to say he was going very fast. Re-energized by the speed at which these two passed me I started moving a bit quicker.After the chain there are large rockslides you walk down with rocks ranging in size from basketball to baseball size, along with alot of loose dirt. With my clumsy footing there were several times a basketball-sized chunk of schnist went flying downward, crunching and cracking the stones below. Luckily they came to a stop before hitting my fellow hikers/climbers who were long gone by this point. The further I climbed down into the canyon the more the view would open up. I was also stopping to take pictures very frequently which did significantly slow my descent. The issue with taking pictures is that the canyon is so deep, large and close it's very hard to get the sky, canyon and river in the frame for perspective.As I approached the bottom the 50 year old man was coming back up and we stopped and chatted for awhile. I mentioned that he better not see me again or he would be going very slowly. (I just assumed he was better up and down than I was, especially with all those fourteeners under his belt).After having some jerky, feeling the freezing giarda filled water and taking numerous pictures from the canyon floor, I started back up. Immediately two problems became apparent. What looked steep upon descent looked unscaleable for ascent. It was at this point I really grasped how steep this canyon was. Next issue is that it was climbable, but now you notice the 60-80 percent grade. Yes, 80 percent grade. This route is full of rocks as previously mentioned that are often just barely at the angle necessary to prevent them all from cascading down into the canyon at once. Back to the problem with the grade. The fatigue sets in. It is a deep fatigue. I just did the Incline at Manitou which is similarly vertical, but even that is not as consistently steep as the Black Canyon. Every movement forward is pretty close to straight up. There is an immediate increase in heart rate even just taking a few climbs up. Every movement forward requires hands and feet. There are few worries about falling now, it's just pure effort.I caught up to the 50 year old about 10 minutes after I started my ascent. He may have beat me down but I was going to beat him back up I thought. We sat on that steep section of loose rock and chatted for awhile again, even at that moment, sitting there relaxing for a bit I realized what a rare experience this was. I immediately felt much less pathetic, especially as I passed the 50 year old.Back to the problems. If those first two weren't enough, the verticality and loose rock, a third quickly became much more bothersome. The ranger had mentioned difficulty in finding the route you took down to come back up and this reared it's head quickly. I walked up false routes several times and was then steered back to the route due to the false path being an obvious dead end. However, at about the half way point I began taking a route I couldn't have possibly come down but with no alternatives in sight. This was serious, challenging climbing over boulders with hand and foot holds necessary. After the boulders disappeared, there were no paths at all to be found, so I went straight into the brambles and forest that clung to the side of the canyon.I wandered left and right, up and down, is poison ivy the one with serrated edges or smooth I thought... no matter I was going straight through both... for what seemed like an hour. Eventually I looked at the photos I had taken on the way down to see if I could get my bearings back. I decided I had drifted too far right on my ascent and needed to go back left. After cutting through the undergrowth to the left for awhile I came up upon a sheer cliff.This either meant I was sure to hit the path going to the right or I had gone so far left I needed to go back down and around this cliff. The prospect of going that far back down to circumvent the cliff was defeating I'll admit. I was running very low on energy at this point having already done a hike in Arches National Park earlier in the day and driving down to Gunnison, all powered by a haphazard hotel breakfast and a Burger King milkshake (my first in 15 years!!). As the sun dipped a bit lower I started to think about the very real possibility I may be sleeping in the canyon for the night. Only another t-shirt and jerky, close to out of water, not great.I started right up and over boulders and through all types of stuff. Through the trees I saw what looked like a route, but as I mentioned earlier, alot of things look like the route. This time it actually was the route. I had bypassed several of the larger rockslide areas and the climbing area with the chain, it was only a bit further up until I hit the switchbacks again. I quickly exchanged relief for fatigue. The rest of the climb back up seemed to be the hardest yet, though it was largely less vertical, especially after I cleared the switchbacks. By the time I got back it was 6pm, not a ton of time to be out, 4 hours, but I was probably on pace to make 5pm if not veering drastically off course. I found the ranger and she said ""Hey!! You made it back! Now we don't have to go looking for you!""To sum it up I'd say this is exactly what I was looking for. A sense of wilderness, danger and excitement that is not completely under your control. Loved it.","July 18, 2013",Gunnison Route to the River and Back,6,"Nashville, Tennessee, United States",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"It's another one of our fabulous National Parks ~ what's not to like? Absolutely spectacular views from every viewpoint. I loved the setting of the visitors center which is a cool log building and it overlooks the deep gorge. Short walk to a viewpoint of the gorge from the visitors center which was beaufiful. Lots of overlooks that offer a different angle of the gorge than the one before it. Spent quite a bit of time at the Painted Wall overlook. It was very peaceful listening to the Gunnison River below and watching all of the different birds that inhabit the park. If you are into camping, the campground is decent but a little rugged probably more of a dry camping experience. Saw deer munching on the bushes at a campsite.

But read everything on the rim stops and you understand the geological importance of the area, especially the painted walls view. Plus the history about exploration and building of irrigation tunnel and railroad is fascinating. The visitor center is very nice and be sure to watch the video. They also sell one of the nicest mugs I have seen in a national park - black, blue, or green with very nice design. I hiked down to the river from VC - they issue only 15 permits a day for this. It is a hike only for the fit and prepared - 1.65 mile one-way, 1800 foot vertical drop, 35-40% slope. But a great payoff at the river! Took me 4 hours round trip, plus I enjoyed the river for a few hours of rest. The Mark Warner trail at the western end of the rim stops is nice but you could not see much from its end point. You do get great views from sections of the trail. It is longer than you think so take water. There is no food for sale so bring your own. There is also a boat tour in the Curecanti refuge - go to web page for information. A nice hike down to the boat and then a tour of one of the reservoirs. This is maybe 20 miles east of the park. There is summer construction on rte 50 so allow plenty of drive time. If Ranger Curtis is your guide, you are in for an excellent guided tour.","July 14, 2013","Soaring views, deep-down hike",55,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"It was absolutely amazing and scary at the same time. I never knew that I had a fear of heights until we hit the first look out in the park. By the end of touring the park, my fear of heights subsided, and I was totally over come with the beauty and expansiveness of the canyon. It was $15 to get out. You pay on the way out of the park. The day we went was 103 degrees. We brought plenty of water to drink and hats with wide brims. The sun was hot, but not unbearable. Because of no humidity you dont get thirsty, but you need to drink.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon of the Gunnison is worth a visit if you are around the area and have at least 2 hours to spare. Before you start hiking, I suggest going to the visitor center first to watch the documentary film about the history of the black canyons. It will give you a much better appreciation of the black canyons. The Painted Wall and the Black Canyon are great sights to see but they don't show as well in photos since they appear monochromatic. The canyons are much more menacing and impressive to see in person.","July 12, 2013",Worth a short trip,48,"Seattle, Washington",4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We added this site to a Colorado National Parks trip that included Arches, Canyonlands, Mesa Verde, and Black Canyon of the Gunnison. I didn't have much expectations for this park, but ended up enjoying the entire vacation experience for this portion the best of all. We stayed at a Day's Inn in Montrose that was exceptional, including an outdoor pool and hot tub for AFTER the hike! Black Canyon provides relatively easy (less than a mile) hikes to overlooks and the best overlook from above being out the Back Side of the Visitor Center. Amazing over 270 degree view plus a video inside about the area's creation and discovery and positive changes resulting from man's influence (refreshing!) However, the best part, from my vantage point, was the drive down to the bottom of the canyon (3000 feet in about 20 minutes). Make sure you DON""T have a vehicle larger than 22 feet and you have to shift into low gear due to steepness. However, the views of the river and dam are serene, with fewer people taking advantage of this part of the park. Bring a picnic lunch and a towel to dry your feet if you choose to wade into the water! If you are a fly fisherman - it's a great spot, it seems. A nice treat is that it is also cooler in this part with more shaded areas and picnic benches under the trees. It is not listed on the maps of the park, but there is a bathroom facility down there as well. Back in Montrose we discovered wonderful walks along ""Main Street in Motion"" that happen weekly and included music played outside as people were able to stroll, grab a beverage or food, and sit down in the shade to listen to a variety of music styles. It was overall provided a nice bird-watching, canyon overlook to a river below, relaxing, soothing, and refreshing trip! We discovered a great restaurant on the edge of town called Remington's at The Bridges that finished off the experience perfectly with dinner and music on a patio overlooking the mountains and the 18th tee of a golf course. They have music every Friday and happy hour specials 4-6. Excellent personnel that made the experience even better. Sat out in comfy love seats after dinner outside, enjoying the scenery, listening to music, and chatting with locals who absolutely LOVE the area, it seems! I could see why!","July 11, 2013",Stunning Views from above but make sure to drive into the Canyon,1,Penfield,4

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This is a must-see...truly spectacular. You drive through and stop at as many overlooks and you want to. The visitor center has some good exhibits and we really enjoyed the movie there. We were amazed at how the canyon was discovered/explored. It gives you a different type of appreciation as you gaze down into the canyons. Each stop affords a slightly different view. It took us several hours, but we wanted to keep stopping to take pictures at each of the stunning vistas. There are some tight turns, but the driving was fine. If you have time, take the Portal Road down to the dam. I must warn you though, use low gear as there is a very steep incline and lots of hairpin turns. At the bottom, you can drive up to the dam, but can't really see much. There is a picnic area by the river, and we stopped there for lunch. It was peaceful and quiet.","July 2, 2013",Spectacular overlooks,62,NJ,5

However, once we got inside it was definitely worth it. Our family spent a good amount of time stopping at the various views and we took the best pictures of our entire vacation from here. The kids loved it too, we just had to watch them very carefully because there are some places where you can get very close to the sheer sides. The view at the Painted Wall reminded me of scenery from the Lord of the Rings. Pictures don't do this place justice.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We altered our planned vacation route after tips from friends about this Canyon. What a great decision that was! The drive along the south rim was easily accessible, with many places to stop to see the gorge. There is a very good visitors' center with video presentations, many explanatory displays, gift shop, and rest rooms. We also discovered a very knowledgeable staff of national park guides who were quite helpful.The canyon itself is phenomenal, with sheer cliffs that drop away at your feet. Even with protective railings, we still felt an incredible adrenaline rush as we looked down 2300 feet! This place is a photographer's dream. Abundant wildflowers line the roads and walkways. Take a picnic lunch and plenty of water and enjoy the scenery along the way.This attraction costs $15 per car to enter, and it is worth every penny. As a bonus, for the stout of heart, there is a road which leads directly to the canyon floor. One should allow at least half a day to wander through this park and see all that is there.

There is a great film at the visitor center that explains how the park was explored, developed and used. There are plenty of bathroooms but no eating facilities. bring a picnic-lunch and eat at one of the tables available.

The visitors center was well done and the ranger staff so helpful and informative. The film about how the area was formed is also well done. We walked out to every overhang and enjoyed seeing how the schist of the area is almost impenetrable--wearing away only 1 inch per century. The depth of the canyon is inspiring. We saw two red-tailed hawks soaring on thermals as they searched for food, and we spotted the Dragon's Tongue at one oversight. Lunch at High Top at a lovely picnic table out of the wind was perfect for this brisk day. Also, the wildflowers were at their glorious peak with arrowroot, lupine, larkspur and others providing wonderful welcomes to many of the trails.","June 18, 2013",Black Canyon of the Gunnison River,67,"Richmond, Virginia",5

This place is totally out this world and is a must see. The park has a small visitors center with a informational movie and the usual souvenirs. The real magic is on the south rim drive. This is a short 5mile or so out and back drive. But, there are numerous points of interest with spectacular views that will take your breath away. Black Canyon is also the native home for Peregrine Falcons and it you are among the lucky and if you have a good spotting scope or high power binoculars you may get a glimpse of a pair in their nest high on the cliffs of the painted wall. Once you are out of the park head east on US 50 to Colorado 92 and make the 50 mile drive up the north rim for even more spectacular views.

It's pretty much a smaller Grand Canyon but even so, standing at the edge of the viewpoints and looking down I still got that dizzying feeling. It's good to see the river running along the bottom of the canyon too. There are loads of viewpoints to park at and plenty of hikes to do, some even go to the canyon floor.

They're grand, they're big and there's lots to do and see. As much as I treasure having the Black Canyon of the Gunnison in my own back yard, I don't think it hits the National Park status. National Monument, you bet. It's good for a night or two if you're not a serious rock climber or an avid fishermen willing to hike to the canyon floor, but for most I think it's a great overnight stay in the park campground and a drive or a bike ride down the rim drive.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Great way to spend the day - beautiful canyon, nice views! I think it was $15 admission (per car) to the park.Plenty of advice in previous reviews, but I'll add:The walk to the canyon is challenging but rewarding. We did the Gunnison route which is supposed to be the easiest option. 90 minutes down, about 2 hours to come back up. 1.2 miles each direction. You are scurrying over rocks, but no technical skills needed. Not recommended though unless you are in good shape. We went in May and we didn't see anyone else during the entire journey. 1) Ensure you bring enough water and good shoes.  2) The path isn't marked.... I appreciated having GPS tracking on my phone... I'd recommend as it helps with """"do we go left or right here?"""" 3) Bring some just-in-case items. We didn't need, but in hindsight, should have (Flashlight, bandaids, etc) 4) Consider taking your rings/watch/bracelets off.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon Of the Gunnison is different from many of the other national parks of the west in that it's smaller size makes you feel that you are more in touch with the canyon. Being so narrow in most places, you have a sense of scale. There seem in be starting and ending points in most areas. Not the vast expanse of the Grand Canyon or Bryce Canyon. You can clearly hear the river down below. As deep as it is, you sometimes feel as it you can touch the opposite side. At one spot the canyon is only forty feet wide. Visiting in early May, I was often alone on the South Rim drive. Whether sunny or cloudy, you will be treated to an inspiring vista. Clouds wrapping over the rim of the canyon are mesmerizing. My first day was up on the south rim, my second day was done on the canyon floor via the East Portal Road. Don't be scared off by the steep grades. I never felt uncomfortable or near the edge of control. Take the opportunity to see the canyon from above and below. During my visit to the floor, I encountered only a few fishermen and a park service truck. The visitor center is smaller, but does have some interesting exhibits and the 18 minute video is entertaining and informative. The ranger on duty was extremely helpful and outgoing.I would have loved to visit the north rim, but that is reached via another entrance and time did not permit me to make that drive.","May 12, 2013",Get Close,1,"Darien, Illinois",5

There are so many short hikes along the rim of the canyon, with dizzying drops of more than 2,000 feet to the Gunnison River below. It is possible to drive down to the bottom of the canyon on a well maintained blacktop road, but the hiking is not easy and there are places where scrambling over scree slopes are necessary. April is a good time to visit. The park is almost deserted","May 7, 2013",Inspiring experience,53,Hudson,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We visited the north rim. Until you are right at the canyon rim you don't really have any idea what is in store. There are narrower and bigger canyons but the combination here is visceral. Go to the edge and look down and you'll feel your stomach tightening. We walked along the Northern Rim and went down to the river via the Long Draw route. Be sure to space out the folks in your group as it is easy to inadvertently kick rocks down on those farther below. Footwear with ample ankle support is highly advised as well. Apparently there is a lot of poison oak as well so long pants and sleeves are recommended. Coming back up wasn't as hard as expected but going down was harder than expected. The perspective from the river is quite different so I definitely recommend a trip down if you have the time/energy.I would also recommend walking to viewpoint of the Painted Wall. It is very impressive. I'm not sure this is a multi-day park but it certainly has that ""jaw-dropping"" quality too it.","April 18, 2013",Look down and you feel it in your stomach,134,"Santa Cruz, California, United States",5

The visitor center is fairly new, has informative rangers and offers a short video on the history of the park. I recommend you watch the video first, then do the drive. If you are up for a great hike, take the one at the end of the road. However, it is not a flat trail but doable for most people. Go to Sunset point at sunset....the canyon lights up. We spent about 4 hours in the park and felt we did it justice. We were there in September and the park was not crowded and could easily get parking at all the lookouts and visitor centers.

There are also picnic tables at some of the overlooks. We spent about 3 hours here on our visit and didn't stop at every overlook.This uncrowded park is definitely worth a visit; photographers will find many options for photos.There is a steep drive down to the river (which we didn't take) as well as hiking opportunities for those in excellent physical condition with much hiking experience (which doesn't describe us).We loved seeing God's handiwork so magnificently displayed.","September 24, 2012",Completely Different from the Grand Canyon,7,"Fairway, Kansas",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I fond it hard to decide how to spend my time here, so, here's my experience, I hope it helps...I approached the canyon from a couple of different hikes and drives:1-North Rim - Hiking from the Ranger's station to Exclamation Point (1.5 miles, about 30 minutes, not too strenuous) is a lovely hike but frankly it is not close to the rim, so you are walking through the woods without much of a view. The view from the point is super, though, and worth the trip.2-Continuing up to Green Mountain (another 2 miles, aprox 1 hour) is a little strenuous but not too bad, but frankly I didn't think the payoff was worth it. You get a broader via of the length of the canyon, but I wouldn't bother. There are jaw-dropping views elsewhere.3-South Rim, Visitor's center is worth a stop. The view from there is panoramic and amazing. You may feel like a cheater, because it doesn't require a hike, but this is awesome.4-South Rim, Portal Drive - takes about 20 minutes to drive to the bottom of the canyon. Since the canyon is very steep, there are very few points in the drive where you get a broad, amazing view. And there's not much going on down at the bottom. If you have been to the bottom of Zion or Grand Canyon, it is a totally different story. I know this sounds jaded but again, I did not think this was worth the drive. Those are the four approaches I took. If I had more time I would drive the South Rim Drive, I suspect there are great views and hikes to be had there. I hope it helps you!","September 17, 2012",A Few Different Views,72,new york,5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We did this in a half a day, and it was not enough time, so we stopped in the main building and bought the video. There is lots to do. You can take a 5 mile trip down to the river, and where we didnt take it, I wished we'd had time. There are pull off places as you go along the south rim where you can take pictures, some with several hundred yard hikes, but be careful, as many of these places have steep sheer drop offs with no guard rails. The altitude is 7-8,000 foot, and it can be a challenge to do even a short hike. None of these things good if you have young children. One of the hiking trails had descriptions of the botany nearby, which was amazing. there is something called 'Mountain Mahogany' which has seeds that have tiny hairs on each seed pod. Very cool. We met people from France, Germany and other countries which made it all the more interesting. One of the things that i found most amazing is that the surrounding area is very boring, with nothing much more than high plains desert and tumbleweed. I kept imaging what it must have been like for the first people who found this canyon. They must have totally blown away!!

At first I thought that at my age that I would not be able to make it to river, but I did. There were no steep drop offs if you stay the trail.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"I spent two nights tent camping on the south rim. The canyon is a beauty with steep walls carved into dark rock. The views keep changing with the light over the course of the day. I got a permit to go down the steep trail to the river. This was not my best decision. The trail drops 1800 ft in one mile. The descent involves extreme use of the (under used) muscles on the front of the thigh to keep upright. The ascent is easier. Time: 1.5 hrs down, 2 hrs up. However, for nearly a week after I was stiff and sore. Considering that I can walk up and down an easy Colorado 14er with no difficulty, this canyon descent should be carefully considered.","September 11, 2012","Spectacular, but hike to bottom is difficult",30,North Carolina,5

We visited both North and South Rim (not doable in one day), The North Rim is much less developed but I would say that it offers nicer views and better trails although the trail to Warner Point on the South Rim is also very nice.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Having visited most all the main attractions in Colorado, we decided on the spur of the moment to visit this park. About three hundred & fifty miles from Denver by way of Tennessee Pass, this is a wonderful relatively not well known Nat. Park. The South Rim entrance is a short drive from the main hwy.& what a surprise. Similiar to the Grand Canyon in depth, but the magnificence of the sheer walls of multi colored rock far surpasses anything in the Grand Canyon. Very well kept roads, very clean restrooms throught out the park & Rangers who were very helpful with information. You can drive down to the bottom of the Canyon, but the drive is posted as 16% grade & it looked to be more than that in several places, its not for the faint of heart as my co-pilot said.. There are plenty of Motels in Gunnison & Montrose to accomodate any size party & reasonably priced. We were told the view from the North Rim surpassed the South , but the 92 miles around to the North Rim will be for another long weekend.","September 5, 2012",Worth the trip,25,"Centennial, Colorado",5

The canyon is georgeous...the drop off's made me nervous, straight down rock walls!! Lots of instructional info at the visitor center. We also drove to the bottom to see the river.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We never heard of this Park and so glad my wife found it. We tent camped two nights at the North Rim campground and it was a great little campground. Clean facilities, nice spots and water were available. Some of the sites could accommodate smaller RVs. You may wonder what the Park and campground are like as you are driving there but you will be pleasantly surprised with this gem of a park.There are several trails along the rim although we didn't hike them. We chose to hike to the Gunnison River through the SOB Draw. If the ranger station is open talk to them before you hike any of the draws. A backcountry permit is required to hike any of the draws even if you are just doing a day hike. If you are not in decent physical/cardiovascular shape I don't recommend doing any of the Draws. Take plenty of water and start the hike early. We started around 9:30 am and unfortunately were coming out of the Draw at the height of the sun - it was a SOB coming out. Down and up took us about 8 hours with a lunch break at the river.We didn't visit the south rim but the rangers did say the north rim is much less crowded and the campground is smaller and better shaded than the south rim campground.

The rangers were very helpful and passionate about their park.We spent two nights in the East Portal campground on the Gunnison River. There is another campground up on the main road. However, the camp sites on the river are dramatically better because you can experience wildlife, such as deer, fly fishing in the river, sleep under the trees and be away from the big RVs that are prohibited from going down the tight curves at a 16% grade.There is a store at the intersection of Hwy 50 and 347, entrance to Black Canyon of the Gunnison River National Park, where you can get firewood and cooking basics.","August 12, 2012","Amazing park, a top 10",4,"Houston, Texas",5

Black Canyon is not as big or colorful as the Grand Canyon, but I believe that there are more interesting and varied views of the canyon from its south rim road than from the Grand Canyon's. The bottom of this canyon has been described as one of the last really inaccessible spots in the National Park system, and while that's probably an overstatement, it's what will be on your mind when you gaze the thousands of feet into its depths and try to imagine what a (rarely made) trip on the river through the bottom of this slot in the earth would be like.One warning about photography: I'm not the first person to comment that there is something about this canyon that makes it very difficult to get photographs that capture its majesty and depth.

Camped in the campground and saw lots of Mule deer that also seemed to camp in the campground. Heard them eating nearby bushes at night while trying to sleep.

When we visited (May) it wasn't busy and as usual if you step away more than 200 yards in any national park, the majority of people are left behind. Talk about a step back in time! There's a tricky curving drive down to the actual river but amazing to watch the force and power up close.

It is a loop, but I wouldn't say it is flat. This trail will take you down to the river, but you have to have a permit to go all the way down to the Colorado river.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"It’s mesmerizing. You stand at the edge of the cliff and look past your toes, over 2000 feet straight down into the canyon. You can hear, and sometimes see, the Gunnison river below. This is one of the most unforgettable of all our National Parks. It not only has breathtaking scenery, but there’s a spiritual element to the park. If you just drive through and take in a couple of overlooks, you’ll miss the spiritual dimension, but still you’ll be awed by the scenery. The Gunnison river travels steep and fast through some of the oldest and hardest rock in North America. That’s why this canyon, unlike others, is formed into cliffs, at the deepest point over 2500 feet straight down. There are about a dozen overlooks, each one totally different. One of the viewpoints is called Sunset Point. We got there early and secured our spot. Later others showed up. The sun dropped below the distant horizon and practically everyone left… Then the beautiful colors lit up the sky. Sunset doesn’t mean when the sun disappears. It means the beautiful sky following the event. Most people missed the show.Here are some facts about this magnificent canyon. The deepest spot is at Warner Point, 2722 feet. (That’s well over two Eiffel Towers, or two Empire State Buildings.) The narrowest point rim-to-rim is 1,100 feet across, but at the river it’s only 40 feet across at a place called The Narrows. The total length of the canyon is 48 miles, 14 miles of it in the national park. The eastern end of the canyon is in Curecanti National Recreation Area and has three dams to form Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal reservoirs.The river is steep. In the Grand Canyon the river falls an average of 13 feet every mile. Here it falls 43 feet every mile. In one two mile section it falls a steep 240 feet!.

The park brochure has a quote from the first known couple that adventured way down on the canyon floor in 1901. These 2 traveled down the river on ""rubber mattresses"" and surfed the tremendous force of water descending quickly in a very narrow space. This would be the ""good news"" and the ""bad news"" would be that there was no known way to scale the truly vertical, slick walls and get home! The words quoted in the pamphlet are much different than anything I might have said if I could have talked at all!

It also has trees which makes it different from the Grand Canyon. There is hiking within this park but I would state that it leans mor to the primitive stage. There is a visitors center, though. This was our second national monument on this round trip through Colorado and Utah. Our first stop was the Great Sand Dunes N. M. Out third stop was Mesa Verde N.P. Our fourth & fifth stops were Canyonlands N. P & Arches NP , both near Moab, UT. Our last park to visit was Rocky Mountain Nationa Park. We stayed inBlack Hawk, CO at one of the casino's. The road from Black Hawk let's you drive North and then cross the park to the west, drive South and then East Back to Black Hawk. There was a snowfall before we went to Rocky Mountain N. P but it didn't close the road. We went the second week of Sept. , so yu may want to drive this earlier in case a snowfall closes the Rocky Mtn.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"We visited the north rim back in early September 2010 (NOT 2011 a bit dated I know). We didn't mean to visit the north rim but we took a wrong turn outside of Crested Butte and since we were on vacation and not in any hurry to be anywhere in particular, we explored our way in a 200 mile loop that day and were very glad we wound up seeing the canyon from the north rim. We weren't sure where we were going but were using our GPS and it got us there. We were a little confused on the final road that took us there and we stopped a local lady out for a walk and asked her if we were heading there on the correct road. She affirmed that we were and when asked if it was worth seeing, she replied that she LOVES the view on the north rim and recommends the view from the north rim over that of the south rim. That was encouraging!When we drove into the park, we came to a T-split in the road. It was getting late in the afternoon and we may have had 2 hours of light or less left. To the right a sign indicated was a welcome center and to the left the north rim drive. We didn't have time for whatever was inside the welcome center and drove left to the rim.A disclaimer. If you have a fear of heights, you need to be prepared mentally for both the drive and the short walks that will take you to the edge of the abyss. It is fabulously scary! All four of us are a little nervous with heights. I am by far the worst.So I drove us around a sinuous road that followed the canyon and in some cases there were drop-offs just a few feet off the roadway. This was a little disconcerting and I found myself driving as far to the opposite side of the road as appeared safe to do so as I could.We stopped and at one or two overlook areas. I can't tell you how impressive this canyon was. Our two boys were about 8 and 11 then and they were surprisingly impressed with this canyon. In fact, later on our long loop West that fall, we visited the Grand Canyon in Colorado. When they got their first sight of that timeless canyon, they sighed and said, ""This is nothing compared to the Black Canyon."" What?! I don't know that that was a fair assessment but I guess it does go to show that it is a destination you don't want to miss if you should get the opportunity.At one of our stops we noticed a young man setting up a camera and tripod. We spoke with him briefly and discovered he was on a 2 week vacation from his Camp Lejeune. I told him that this wasn't an ideal place for 4 people scared of heights. Some of the overlooks have no fencing or anything to keep you from falling over! (to one of those we literally crawled on our bellies to the edge!) He replied, that we shouldn't feel bad about being scared to go to the edge and that he had gotten a little woozy on his first approach on foot to the edge, and he added, ""...and I jump out airplanes for a living!"" lol He also mentioned that he was looking for a spot where he could free-climb to the canyon floor. I had never thought about doing that for a vacation activity and I'm sure I never will! Maybe that's your style though.At the best overlook that we stopped at, we could see the great chasm off to our right where it curves and supposedly is the deepest, steepest drop in the canyon. Something like over 2,700 feet vertical from rim to floor (don't remember the exact figure). To our left the canyon continued as far as we see with a view of the river and of vultures watching for something to eat far below. The wind was blowing up the sides of the canyon wall and I had to hold my cap to keep from losing it when peering over the fencing at that location. Sunset was spectacular but we couldn't stay and watch it completely as we needed to drive a good ways to our stay for the week. The drive to Gunnison was the scariest drive I have ever experienced. The 2 lane highway was curvy and with continual drop-offs and of course the wind. I was creeping along (to my family's chagrin at about 20-25 mph on a 30-35 mph road and occasionally being passed by polite locals driving this stretch at 50 mph. Hate to admit it but yeah, that was I who was creeping along like an elderly, nearly blind man! I found that crossing the center-line when I could see the upcoming traffic was a good idea. Actually, for those 40 or 50 miles, I doubt we saw more than 5 or 6 other vehicles in either direction. Other than the goofy fear of heights, it was a marvelous drive. We saw four buck mule deer with their velvety racks right on the side of the highway in that stretch. Amazing.Be sure you have a full tank of gas...and enjoy a few pics from our visit!","March 27, 2012",Incredible,27,"Puebla, Mexico",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"It's a pitty that this NP is a little remote and hidden in Colorado because it is a real treasure. After you managed a very long and steep access road from the next US highway you will take a deep breath when you get a chance to have a first look into the canyon! Wow!, What a view! Spectacular viewing points all along the park road. The Visitor Centre is small but very interesting and also offers great views; I'm sure it would be enlarged if the number of visitors would justify this. It would be nice if there would be more RV spaces with power; this could also increase the number of visitors.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The Black Canyon is a relatively new national park and as it is less well known it is not too crowded. I went with my children in July 2011 and we had a great time. We did the South Rim drive and walked to all the viewpoints. None is a long walk but each is worth doing.The canyon is not the Grand Canyon but is deeper than it in some parts. What makes it so amazing is how vertical the walls are, it just appears as a deep slash in the ground. The rock walls have any varied colourations and are an amazing sight.The weather was mixed when we went and the rain and mistiness can add to the atmosphere. We drove to the picnic area at the end of the drive and actually had a picnic lunch there as the sun came out. The canyon opens out here and you get a gret view of the Gunnison valley as it energes from the canyon proper.Well worth a visit, allow half a day if you just do the drives.","March 24, 2012",Awe inspiring deep canyon,27,"Plano, Texas",5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This canyon is made from Black granite. The sides are very steep with several sharp outcrops on the side. It has taken the Gunnison river 100years to erode 1inch. In winter you have the benefit of snow to help define the outcrops. Unfortunately, they only keep a small section (southern entrance only) open. You can cross country from the Visitor centre to the other viewpoints. It would be safe and scenic. Pity we did not bring our skis. Take warm clothes and gloves as it is cold in winter. Free coffee. Part of the National Parks. Annual Pass $80. They did not charge in Winter.We had a lovely day.

Hiking down to the river is REAL CHALLANGE, so be sure you are in shape. Involves a lot of rock scrambles. Be sure to LISTEN to the rangers advise (you need a free permit before going) because I did get turned around once on the way back up. I have hiked several Rocky Mountain trails in the past but this was by far the hardest I have ever attempted alone. I am a 50 year old male in average physical shape.

Lots of places to stop and look over the canyon...we were here Sept 2011 and temps were little bit warm until you got the cool breezes. Ranger station was nice and the rangers were very friendly and informative. When you leave and are coming back down the hill there were spectacular views of the area.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"This is a relatively new national park. It's just a few miles east of Montrose. There was a good Visitor Center and we talked at length with a Ranger about the park, water, geology, and more. We were lucky it was a slow day. Enter the park and there is a drive of a few miles along the south side of the canyon with about a dozen places to stop and look over the edge and watch the Gunnison River way below you. It's just as easy to hear it as see it. It's called Black Canyon because the width of the canyon is so narrow (but plenty deep) that only noon day sun goes down into the canyon. We were lucky to be there for a few hours at midday for good light. We stopped at seven of the overlooks. Ask the Rangers for which ones you should not miss but if you are there all day then check out them all. There were some picnic tables and washrooms but not much else. After spending some very nice time in the park we stopped at the second of the dams that are farther up stream for a good luck at what man has done to nature.","October 8, 2011",Looking down into the canyon was unbelievable,766,Minnesota,5

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon is a new National Park: it attained NP status in 1999. It's still rough and ready. Camping is primitive and everyone you meet has that pioneer spirit.There's no lodge or restaurant. There IS water in campgrounds and at the visitor center, so don't believe the sign at the tourist trap at the Park's highway entrance. Plenty of water is available in the Park.Campgrounds are great -- as laid out, there's a screen of privacy between each, courtesy of the native scrub oak. Bear boxes are available. Fire rings -- just bus in your own wood.My friend and I did the Gunnison route scramble to the river and back. It was amazing and rewarding, but I don't think we could've hacked it unless we'd brought the amount of water recommended by the NPS at the Park site:http://www.nps.gov/blca/planyourvisit/hikinginnercanyon.htmThe volunteers at Gunnison are great. My friend and I got to look through a solar scope at the visitor's center on our last morning. Ominously, I also saw an SAR guy headed down to the river.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Black Canyon was perfect for us. We need a place to stop on the way back to Denver from Telluride, so we spent a few hours one afternoon doing the South Rim drive. The reason it takes that long is each of the dozen or so stops has a short hike out to the viewing point. The viewing points were all great and pretty distinctive.The best viewing point of all is the Warner Point Nature Trail at the end. It's about 1.5 miles, takes about an hour round-trip. Awesome views of the canyon to the north and valley to the south.Perhaps this next item should be another review, but if you can manage to climb 240 stairs back out of the canyon, check out the 90-minute Morrow Point Boat Tour of the canyon from the bottom, which we did the next morning at 10:00a.You can apparently camp and get permits to hike the inner canyon if you're into that, but if you have just a day, the south rim drive covers some amazing highlights of the canyon.","September 13, 2011",Unexpectedly Awesome,10,"Chicago, Illinois",5

The hike down is steep (2,000 vertical feet in less than a mile) with many sections that require downclimbing, but it is so rewarding for the experienced climber or backpacker.

To get a full view I visited everyone of the different viewpoints on the South rim all of which are within 1.7 miles of the parking spots. To get a better sense of the depth of the canyon I hiked the Curicanti Creek trail from Pioneer Point on the North rim. The hike is 2 miles long each way with a 880 foot elevation change. The views of the creek which cascades down a side canyon are beautiful, and it exits into the main Canyon close to the Curicanti Needle, an interesting geological feature. I spent time reading the various information plaques to learn the interesting story of the geological formation of the canyon.","August 4, 2011",The Black Canyon of the Gunnison River is an awesome place,66,"Stone Mountain, Georgia",5

Please watch your children as there are several areas where they could manage to get close to the side.You can see the Gunnison river below. We made several stops along the way, to take photos. Painted canyon is a good area for photos. Some of the birds (swallows i think) as they soar past you in the canyon sound like jets.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Friends warned us that the park was very small and not very pretty and we could finish in a day, however we found plenty to do in our 3 day weekend and hiked 13 miles the first day doing two different hikes and 10 the next and then 7 the last day. We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express which was adequate, although a bit noisy one night. We hiked the Curecanti Creek trail which was gorgeous - wildflowers, waterfalls, canyon walls. Dillon Pinnacles was a fun shorter and flat hike where we saw some big horn sheep, and then also hiked Exclamation Point trail, North Vista trail and another one that connected. We probably could not have stayed there for a week, but for a short weekend trip it was perfect! On the way back we white water rafted in Buena Vista which was the perfect end to our trip.Twisted Fork restaurant was delicious and catered to my meat eating husband and my vegan tendencies!","July 28, 2011",Nice hikes in the area,31,denver co,4

The fee was very low, 8$ if I recall correctly.Viewing the Black Canyon was easy and did not require a lot of walking/hiking. We drove around, stopping off at different viewing points...like scenic overlooks along a highway. Some overlooks required a small amount of walking, which even a 50+ with a bad knee could do easily. The views deep into the canyon were spectacular! Pictures I took did not do it justice. We spent over an hour watching men rock climb. As per the Ranger they were a volunteer group performing mock rescues..scary and riveting.Rangers were handy, talking about the rock types/history of the formation of the canyon. Lots of restrooms.

Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Although it is easy to gaze across the half-mile or so that separates the South Rim from the North Rim, they are worlds (and at least a two-hour drive) apart. The Park Service charges the standard entry fee to drive along the south rim’s paved road, and has a fully equipped ranger station with displays, vending machines, and a comfortable, wheelchair-accessible deck. The pavement ends 6 miles before you reach the north side. Camping on the South is mostly in the open, and quite competitive. Camping on the north is in a PJ forest (Pine and Juniper) and is limited to 12 spaces. That limitation notwithstanding, one can usually find a campsite. There is no fee to visit the north rim as long as you don’t plan to descend into the canyon (not for the faint of heart). From either side, the sights are breathtaking. The river runs about 2000 feet below—so far down that finding a photo that adequately shows the perspective is difficult. If you have small children, be especially mindful of them. There are places where you can peer over the edge of a red granite rock 1800+ feet straight down without a guardrail. People (illegally) base jump into the canyon because it is one of the few places where one can reach terminal velocity before having to open one’s parachute.In short, the South Rim drive is paved with good facilities at the cost of an entrance fee, and higher traffic. There is a paved road all the way down to the river. The North Rim drive, is well maintained, but unpaved, has more, and in my photographer’s eye, better overlooks. Access to the river is about a five-hour trek that requires preparation, some experience, and a permit. Either is a worthwhile day trip.","August 9, 2010",Which rim to visit?,13,"Cedaredge, Colorado",5

The landscape offers very little shade to escape the heat and we found ourselves making quick runs to the overlooks while one of us stayed in the car with the air conditioning running for our dog. At the end of the loop on the south rim, I believe it is High Point, there were picnic tables with shade. Since this is a new park and funding has been tight, there are no flush toilets in the park. There are a few snacks at the visitor's center, but nothing substantial. If you are very prepared for the starkness of the services, I'm sure it would be very worth it.

The Visitor Centre at the second stops is excellent. Each overlook tells you the distance you have to walk, and it is worth noting this as sometimes these are a fair walk from the main route. Whatever you do, do not leave without taking the road down to the floor of the canyon. This is a dirt road, but relatively wide and easy to drive.

You cannot go to this park, drive over the hills, pay admission, and leave after seeing it from one overlook. It just would not be a sensible visit. You should go to each of the overlooks. The view of the deep gorge is almost different from every one. It's really amazing to see how a river could have forced a gorge that deep. I would make it a must-see stop if you're in the state of Colorado.","June 13, 2008","Totally worth it, a must-see",16,"Shelby, Nebraska",5
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"Take the guided boat tour of the Black Canyon. You will want to reserve for this trip ahead of time to get a spot. You can do this at the visitor center. The trip itself was a nice one on a pontoon style boat. You must be prepared for stairs. Walking down is the easy part. There's over 200 stairs to climb back up. But it's well worth the trip if you can do the stairs. Then it's a bit of a walk, it takes about 10 minutes to get there to the location where you board the boat. It's a flat walking trail (once a railroad there). Along the way are excellent covered over picnic table niches that are very nice if you bring your backpacks down for after the boat tour. We took a morning tour, the first out. It was perfect. I forget the exact length of the trip. I'd say it was at least/around 1.5 hrs. in length. Go to the nps.gov site for the Black Canyon area to find out more details. Bring your cameras lots of picture opportunities here! The whole family enjoyed it. Our boys were six and eight at the time of our trip in June of '07.  One thing we didn't do but you should do is to get a up above view of the canyon. MIL/FIL came back with the best pic of them with the view of the canyon below and behind them! Ask at the visitor center and I'm sure they'll be able to provide that perfect locale for an up above pic like our in-laws got.","March 4, 2008",Fun tour with spectacular views,106,WI,4
Black Canyon Of The Gunnison National Park,"The one thing I took with me from my visit to Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is an appreciation for the sheer force of running water. It's amazing when you think that this giant canyon was formed by a river, far down below. The park has pleasant stops with lots of photo opps. We brought along a picnic lunch and ate underneath the trees. Roads were good, trails well marked. Great view of surrounding towns. I loved listening to the river running swiftly below. Great stop. Worth the trip.","January 8, 2007",Worth the trip,47,"Brewton, Alabama",5
