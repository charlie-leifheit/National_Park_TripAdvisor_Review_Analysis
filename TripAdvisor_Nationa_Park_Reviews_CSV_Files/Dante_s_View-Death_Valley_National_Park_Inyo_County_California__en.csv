Dante's View,This is fantastic. Go here and enjoy a view out of another world. We had seen several pictures from the place. Still we nearly lost our breath when we saw it ourselves.

Dante's View,I have been excited about this experience and it didn’t let us down. We went about 6:30PM and watched the sunset over the mountains and waited for the stars. It isn’t very far off the main but it is a curvy road going up the mountain. This was the best part of our Death Valley day trip.

Dante's View,"We stayed in Death Valley for 2 days and one of the things we wanted to do was Dante's View.It is 6,000-7,000 of elevation, so you are heading up and up and up..... Really great drive to the peak, winding roads and great views. It is a drive in itself of pure scenery.Once you reach the peak, there is plenty of parking and temperatures drop by about 10 degrees, so welcome break from the heat below..The views are just amazing, on a good day, which you will be unlucky in Death Valley not to have one, you can see for miles....Literally miles...Take the walk out along the dirt track to the end and you can feel like you are at the end of the world......Seriously so cool thing to do..... I would suggest as well spending a little extra time and do the walks either side of the carpark, they go higher and views even better... If you have time of course, but worth it...Enjoy the views... There was a ranger up there checking you had your passes into the national park, so be warned. There is a fee to enter the national park, but it is worth getting one in case. Not sure if you get a fine, but the ranger was on duty the day we were thereGreat experience.","August 28, 2019",What a view,107,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5
Dante's View,"Tip: Made it here from Stovepipe Wells in an hour driving a bit above the speed limit.Terrific view. Highly recommend taking the 10-15 walk out of the parking lot. It's the only way you will see both ends of the valley floor. A truly unique view of the park.

Dante's View,"If you go to Death Valley Dante's View is the best spot to view the entire area. Especially in the morning when it's not too hot yet. It takes a bit of a drive to get there and as you get closer to the top it gets a little steep, but in the end it's worth it. Once you get to the top, there are 2 trails that are very easy to get right up to the edge. You might want to get there early because as the day progresses there are more and more travelers and as it gets hotter, even way up above the heat will affect you.

Dante's View is on such a high vantage in Death Valley that the temperature went down from mid 40s (Celsius)/100s (Fahrenheit) to mid 20s (Celsius)/ 60s (Fahrenheit). The view of the Valley from this point is just amazing.

Dante's View,"Beautiful view of Death Valley. Great overlook of the entire valley. This is also where a famous scene in the original 1977 Star Wars movie was filmed.

Dante's View,"Up here, like 5000 feet above the desert (below sea level) floor, people below look like ants to the naked eye. Up here you find a dramatic 360 view of the entire ecosystem. In clear weather you will see the peak of Mt. Whitney. And at night, it's a spectacular star gazing affair. Or how about the sunset as it drops in the West? The drive is an easy one on a freshly revamped roadway. Except trailers are not permitted to the top. The road corkscrews around for the final mile or so to the top, but that should pose no problem. But be careful driving down after dark. There is also some hiking to be done here. One trail follows the ridge south a bit, the other goes north. But don't try either of them in water shoes. Don't miss this spot if you're never coming back.","May 29, 2019","Not Just Dante, But Everybody's View",677,"Henderson, Nevada",5
Dante's View,"Just an amazing valley, with such a dramatic drop from the mountains to the salt lake, yet so colourful despite the barrenness. Didn’t have many visitors though (it’s a bit of a drive but a good sealed road) so was nice and quiet and you can walk out along a ridge for a while.

You can visit the Badwater Basin at sea level, but personally it’s a waste of time. We went early evening and there were quite a few people about, if you can get there in time for sunset, then I think it would be a vision of loveliness.

You have an expansive view up the valley and across to the mountains on the other side, and you are looking down on the lowest place in the US just below you. There are benches to sit and enjoy the view and a couple of information plaques. There are side hikes off either end of the main area that you can do if you want different perspectives. The road up to the view is a pretty drive -- the last little bit is a few tight curves, but if another car is coming, you can stop and wait so you don't have to meet them right in the tight curves.

Dante's View,"A must if you have just done Badwater, since you can look down and see the 5,000+ foot difference from where you just were. People at Badwater appear as mere specks in the white salt flats from here. The road is winding but there is plenty of parking when you get to the top. Be VERY careful if you are leaving the official overlook (which is fully accessible and has guard rails) to walk around a bit; the ground beneath your feet can be uneven and unpredictable, especially if you are bent on the perfect selfie.

Dante's View,"Definitely worth the time it takes to drive up the climbing, steep at times, road to the top. At more than 5,000 ft., the temperature averages some 20 degrees cooler than on the valley floor so you might want a light jacket. You can see Death Valley's lowest and highest points (Badwater and Telescope Peak), and the shimmering expanse of the white salt flats. You can see across most of the 110 mile long Death Valley.

On a clear day you can literally see the entire valley. Where as it was 100+ down in the valley it was only on the 70’s with a nice cool breeze. If your planning on Death Valley National Park then Dante’s view is a must stop. Highly recommended stop.

We actually stayed in Vegas and wanted to find something away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I’ve always have heard about Death Valley, and I always pictured it as a boring desert. I was COMPLETELY wrong. Everywhere we looked here amazed us. It’s such a phenomenal park, we wish we had the tome to explore it all. Plan a couple days here if you’re true National Park enthusiasts.

Dante's View,"Dante's View provides a panoramic view of the southern Death Valley basin. At a height of 1,669 feet, it is located off Route 190, about 30 miles south of Furnace Creek in Death Valley National Park. To the south, the Owlshead Mountains can be seen 19 miles away. To the north, the Funeral Mountains are 31 miles distant. To the west, the Panamint Range rises dramatically to Telescope Peak. To the east is the Greenwater Range. Death Valley straddles the California/Nevada border between the Great Basin and Mojave deserts. It is the largest national park in the lower 48 states with 3,373,063 acres and attracted over 1.6 million visitors in 2018. It is the hottest, driest and lowest of all national parks in the United States. The visitor center in Furnace Creek on State Route 190 offers a 12-minute introductory slide program and displays dealing with the park's geology, climate, wildlife and natural history. Sightseers can navigate the park by automobile, four-wheel drive, bicycle, mountain bike and motorcycle. They can hike, too. State Route 90, the Badwater Road, Scotty Castle's Road and paved roads to Dante's View and Wildrose provide access to the many scenic viewpoints. More than 350 miles of unpaved and four-wheel drive roads provide access to wilderness hiking, camping and historic sites. Death Valley also is a popular destination for star gazing with one of the darkest skies in the United States, especially in the northwest part at Ubehebe Crater.","April 9, 2019",One of Death Valley's most popular scenic attractions,4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Dante's View," Dante’s View will literally take you breath away, for after a quiet drive through the desert, you suddenly view the entire valley spread below you. You can look down to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America and then, if it is a clear day, you can get a glimpse to the North of the Sierra Crest, which hosts the highest mountain in the lower 48 states. You are standing on the Funeral Mountains, looking 20 miles across the Valley to the Panamint Mountain Range. It is very difficult to judge scale in a desert. To get a good idea of what it means to be one mile above the valley, look down and see the road, a little line going along the curve of an alluvial fan. In the middle of the valley you can see a white layer which is make primarily of halite, or table salt. It is the Death Valley Salt Pan, and we will see it up close when we go to Devil’s Golfcourse or Badwater Basin, which is directly below us. ","March 20, 2019",best view of Death Valley,8,,5

Never saw that before, but bc there was a road sign they were putting up, I assume this must be at least a semi common occurrence.

If you look you can see where sediment runs out in a fan shape from the valley walls and where minerals pool on the valley floor.We sold this to the kids as a place they filmed Star Wars.

Dante's View,"We had just completed a two week road trip of 10 national parks so I did not expect Death Valley to impress. It did!. Pictures do not do it justice. It has to be seen to really appreciate the vastness, the lack of vegetation, the amazing rock formations and the subtle colour changes everywhere. We drove from Pahrump to Furnace Creek and back to Las Vegas in a day (8 hrs) and stopped at all the significant (signposted) features on the way in and out. The unexpected hightlight was a gorgeous lunch at The Oasis. Wow what a surprise that was! None of the significant areas, Dantes View, Zabriski Point, Artists Pallette, Devils golf club, etc were difficult to access, just park and walk (or drive Artists Pallette). I will be writing this review for everything we saw in Death Valley. It is SO worth a days visit. Next time we will drive on through hopefully.

Highly recommend that the drive ask passengers to close their eyes for the final turn and then step out of the car to open them. They will be totally amazed!It's best here for photography in the morning, when the sun is at your back. In the afternoon you have a lot of sun and it's harder to photograph the stunning views. Sun sets a bit early because it is going down behind massive Telescope Peak across the valley. Get out of the parking lot and walk just a little ways north on the obvious trail, and you will get more views but get away from the crowds for a little peace.","April 6, 2018",Wonderful morning views!

Dante's View,"Such an incredible panoramic view of Death Valley National Park! We had just a day to spend in Death Valley in late December 2017, & we felt Dante's View was well worth our time & drive there (it's a little off the beaten path). Definitely one of our top 3 stops while we were in Death Valley (the other 2 being Badwater & Zabriskie Point). Dante's View was a great first stop after we entered the park as it allowed us a great overall view from above of where we were headed down to Badwater & northwards into the park. We spent probably 30 minutes enjoying the amazing panoramic views of miles around & taking a lot of pictures. Including the drive there/back & our time there (especially if you'd like to take a few minutes to enjoy your time there), I'd allow at least an hour for Dante's View. Definitely bring your jacket, especially if you're visiting on a cooler &/or breezy day. It wasn't extremely crowded on the morning of our visit in late December 2017, but there were a number of tour groups who stopped at Dante's View when we were there. December seemed to be a good time of year to visit...obviously due to the cooler temps but we also didn't have to fight for parking anywhere. Mornings were a bit cool, so we needed our jackets then, but daytime temps were in the 60's & sunny...perfect for walking around a lot of the amazing sights!","March 2, 2018",Incredible panoramic view of Death Valley National Park!

There is a decent-sized parking lot at the end of the road. We visited the overlook on a Friday morning in November, and it was not crowded. Although it was hot in the valley (79 deg F/26 deg C), it was windy and chilly at Dante's View (63 deg F/17 deg C). Be sure to bring a light jacket. The panoramic views of Death Valley were great.

No bathrooms at the top so make sure the kids go before you get there!Upon arriving, there were lots of people set up with tripods and nice cameras ready to capture the sunset. The view is an overlook of the Badwater Basin and the rest of the Valley below. There are several peaks you can hike to, to hang out and watch the sunset.

It is an unbelievable view of the salt flats and the valley stretched out across the distance with mountains rising on the other side. Have never seen anything quite like it. Starkly beautiful, interesting textures and colors- resembles almost what you'd think of as the landscape of the moon. You can view the area directly from the parking lot or take a worn-in slim trail to the left which takes you over a few hills to get a closer view of the valley - not really a trail easily traversed by strollers or wheelchairs. Really gives you an appreciation of the diversity and the beauty of natural Earth.","December 14, 2017",Surreal,61,,5

Dante's View,"The best time would be by morning light to early afternoon when the sun lights every detail of the landscape. By dusk, the cold wind will kick up in earnest although it always seems windy there. It's higher in altitude, and it's much cooler up there. Windbreaker would be advisable. You have the best sweeping view of Badwater and valley below that I know in the park. It's a bit of a drive which is accessible without 4-wheel drive from HWY 190. There is a length limit due to some narrow turns up near the top. Coming down, I was driving in the first and second gear and riding the break for a good part. If you have a stick shift, this will be a breeze. Allow yourself some driving time.There was a family of three strolling down a steep pitch, mom and dad with a 6 year old girl in between, back down to the parking area from a tip top. Sure footed like mountain goats... There is a hiking trail (8 miles and good deal of altitude gain) that could be great if you are fit and have all day to spend on it. I have never seen anyone doing that, though. Vault toilet which has my vote as ""The Most Scenic Toilet"" in the area is located on the flat pad right down from the top.

Dante's View,"This view point offers the most unique view of the Badwater Basin/Amargosa Valley, some almost 6000ft above sea level. The expansive and meandering salt flats are most appreciated from this vantage point. The park fee is $11, and well worth it. The drive up to the point is at times a bit scary-the lanes are narrow, steep, and with oncoming traffic, it can be nerve wracking, but the views as you drive along to the point are just as breathtaking as once you're at the top! The bathrooms along the way were outhouse style and not very clean, though for a park, it's pretty average. Once you arrive at the top there is a large paved parking area and foot trails to the left and right that lead you along the top of the mountain for a more panoramic view. The trails are easy to traverse and require very little effort. ","August 25, 2017",Best View of the Badwater Basin ,8,"Ottawa, Canada",5

In any case, that probably won’t happen to you so get there full of expectations and once you get there be prepared to be amazed beyond your expectations. It truly is a sight to behold.

Each time I go, I find something new, or I see something amazing. The area gives you a true feeling of peace and you will see that you are but a speck on this planet, the Valley can kill you, if you are not careful and it will also hug you and give you a feeling of calm better than any drink or drug you have ever had.Dante's View is spectacular with views as far as the eye can see. You will drive a while to get there and it is worth it. Make sure your car is in great shape--you do not want to break down in Death Valley-and take water, ever if you have no intention of leaving your car. Be prepared, it can be hotter than anything you can imagine and it can catch up to you and your car fast.Dante's View is at the top of the Black Mountains and it will take your breath away. All of Death Valley will. You can drive up and park and take photos or a break or you can hike and if you decide to hike make sure you know what you are doing.If I were you I would go to the Official Death Valley web site and check weather and closures, flash flood can harsh your entire mellow and if it is close to 120 degrees (considering the heat index) , this is information you will need.You can also go at night and the stars will just send you into another world.

There are signs about bees on the lookout point but we did not see any at all. Great for looking at the sky at night as well. The only problem is that the smog of Southern California casts a fairly heavy haze over the area most of the year. If you are lucky the wind may be blowing and slow for a crisper view.

Seemed like dozens of cars were coming down after sunset, which I am sure was pretty but I felt like telling them the real show was still to come. Sure enough once the sky started to get dark your eyes were welcomed to an amazing show. Stars lined the sky from one horizon to the other. As it got darker and darker you actually began to see the clouds of the Milky Way galaxy, just as clearly as pictures from NASA.

The road to Dante's View is relatively steep and has some sharp turns, if I remember correctly. The road is narrow too so follow the speed limit. We got there a little late so it was a bit dark, but the view was still fantastic (see photo). It's significantly colder up there, especially at sunset. It's quite windy too! I had to leave my cap in the car as I was afraid it would blow away. There was a man there who lost a bunch of papers/documents because of the strong wind. I hope they were not too important. Dante's View is also a great place to look at stars; we saw a ton of them on our way back home.A few general tips for Death Valley:- Death Valley holds the record for the highest reliably recorded air temperature in the world (134°F / 56.7°C). Therefore, make sure you have lots of food and especially water. Wear breathable clothes.- If your car doesn't have a GPS, use real maps or offline Google maps since you won't be able to connect to the internet.

First two parks were pretty cold. And what I saw was stunning. It reminded me of the Mars planet. We have passed several abandoned villages, train stations, cargo trains and more. We drove through the dessert to reach our hotel that reminded me of an oasis (see my review of Furnace Creek Ranch hotel). Next morning we had a guided individual tour which is a must if you want to take the utmost of the park within one day. We visited several places like Zabriski point, sand dunes, art passage with different color mountains, salt lakes and more. And all of that was definitely worth many hours of driving.

I beleive this is the highest point you can drive to in the valley and the Temps are like 20 or more degrees cooler then down below. Also, your cell phone will light up because there is aonly 2 palces you can get a signal and this is one of them.PS: If you like Star Wars, primarily Episode IV from 1977, this is part of your SW tours.

A very enjoyable and amazing drive. Very quiet and peaceful.This is also one of the best locations for stargazers.Tips:1. The nearest gas station is about 60 miles, in Pahrump, Nevada. Last 35-40 mils has no civilization at all. Make sure you car is topped up. 2. Carry enough water and food. If you are planning to go there during summers, carry plenty of water and food. There's a reason why this place is called the ""death valley"". The area around this place can get really hot (111F)3. No cellphone reception - plan to spend the drive n complete communication darkness. I had a few bars at the location but i had no coverage for the most part. If people would be worried about you, let them know you are going into communication darkness. If you are planning to rely on you phone's GPS, don't.

Much props to him as that was a pretty strenuous ride for him, i'm sure. It's a short walk/hike from the parking lot and really you don't have to keep walking even when the trail keeps going as the views are the same, but depending on your activity level i'd say it's a moderate in difficulty. It gets pretty windy but the weather was pleasant at the time of our visit. There are restrooms in this site.","April 29, 2017","Simply beautiful, not to miss",21,"Dallas, Texas",5

The drive up to the view is somewhat lengthy and uphill all the way. It's almost like driving up to a mountain pass. Watch out for cyclists! The temperature up there is also at least 20 degrees cooler than down below in the valley and very, very windy. The view is amazing though, and you can see for miles and miles.

The view from Dante's Peak is very expansive and I place it in the ""interesting"" category because the valley floor below is splotched in whites, greys, and browns creating bizarre patterns.

It really is the WOW spot in Death Valley and it would have nagged at me forever if we had not make the trek up that mountain to get that view!

The drive out to the point is long and winding, if you are going for the sunset be sure to allow plenty of time, it is at least 30 minutes from the turn off 190 to the end of the road at the point.

We didn't want a tourist trap like we've read in reviews regarding the Grand Canyon and are so happy we came here! I cannot imagine the Grand Canyon being anymore beautiful than this place!I had no idea that Death Valley consisted of mountain ranges higher than my home state Rocky Mountains. If you are in Las Vegas - this is a 2 hour drive (to get to the park - and we drove about another hour into the park) and saw many beautiful areas- The next time we go to Las Vegas, we definitely plan on going through the entire park! It was so interesting being in Vegas for several days before and seeing all of the ""excess"" of everything (lights, people, money, gambling, etc.) than going to this desolate land of emptiness. We only saw 12 cars and maybe 20 people tops on our visit to this park. It was a neat experience to say the least! There are parts of Death Valley that have absolutely no life form in it...sort of reminded us of what the planet Mars would be like.

This also puts in perspective how tall the mountains on both sides of the valley are once you get to the valley floor. I know the view would be spectacular if the mountains on the far side were lit up by the sun.You can see a lot from the parking lot, but there are two short paths to take. One takes you to a higher spot with a path that will not work if you have a fear of heights. The other path descends a little to a point that is at the very edge of the mountain.

Dante's View,"We've been stopping in Death Valley almost every December for a night or two. This was our first visit to Dante's View and it was truly incredible. The 13 mile drive to the parking lot was interesting and not too bad. Once at the parking lot, it's well worth the quick hike to the farthest spot to the south of the parking lot. The trail is well-traveled so it's not hard to find. From the highest point on the walk, we realized that we were at about the elevation of Denver, Colorado, looking at the lowest spot in the continental U.S. - from a mile high down to almost 300 feet below sea level. Bring binoculars and a good camera (my cell phone did well). It's a great spot to take a panorama pic too!There's a wonderfully informative sign at Dante's View which helps explain what landmarks you can see. The sign alone is worth studying to get some perspective on distances.I hope we go back to this spot as the view is truly worth the effort.","January 1, 2017","Spectacular, worth the 13 mile drove off the highway!",53,"Santa Cruz, CA",5

You will go right by Zabriskie Point so you can take in that view or the longer hikes on the same drive. Both are very unique so do both!Hiking to the top of the mountain is a great way to extend the view. Not terribly dangerous but not a great hike (10 min) for those with a fear of heights.

I have a bit of a fear of heights and up here I got a bit of the old ""weak knees"" kicking in. I didn't have that problem at Zabriskie Point for some reason, although its not as high up.

Both trails have a variety of rock formations and plants and they go beyond the 1/2 to 3/4mile I hiked on each... I saw a few a couple of rodents, some different types of lizards and birds. While the one leading south is fairly easy and expanses are visible fm the parking lot, as with any hiking exercise caution. Even if you dont have a desire to leave the parking lot area, it's worth the trip (make a picnic (the elevation and low humidity makes it comfortable).

As you would imagine, it can be extremely hot and it is not an attraction for those afraid of heights. For the rest of us, it is a rather unique viewpoint in that it allows visitors to see Mount Whitney and Badwater, the highest and lowest points in the contiguous US from the same location. The very flat aspect of Death Valley can give a false impression of it's size when within it, and Dante's View is an excellent place to gain this sense of scale.","August 29, 2016",Remarkable views of one of the most desolate places on Earth.,8,"Burnley, United Kingdom",5

Dante's View,"Dante's view is reached by a long road that ends at the view. The last quarter mile is very steep and winding and if you're in an RV you will have to park up and walk the final bit. As we were approaching a large group of Harley riders were coming down and one of them cover cooked the sharp descent and bends, hit the gravel off the side of the road and almost had a bad crash. Up at the top there is a small circular car park. You can get great views here but the best views are gained by walking the three hundred yards or so out on the jutting headland. It's rocky and rough underfoot so if you are not stable on loose surfaces, best leave this to the more able walkers. Walk to the end and you have a breathtaking vista of the whole of Death Valley and if you have visited Badwater first, you can look right down on where you were so far below sea level. This is where to take your panorama shots and if you go at sundown, you'll get some awesome pictures as the sun dips below the mountains and the last light hits funeral mountains across the valley.There are big drops here so be sensible, don't run or push past others and don't get too close to the edge as the surface is rough and loose. You can enjoy this completely safely though with common sense and even with relatively small children that are supervised.One word of caution though, it seems to have attracted a colony of bees up there and if you leave car windows open or wear very bright clothes, expect to be harassed by the bees and if you make like a windmill and aggravate them you might get stung. Get in and out of the car quickly and you'll be ok, take your time and expect to leave with 8-10 buzzy travellers sharing your cabin!","August 26, 2016",Stunning views of Death Valley and it's features,129,Cheshire UK,5

Once you get to the top of Dante's View you will be able to see where you were and it's mind blowing. You have to be at the basin first to appreciate the scale from above. The big bonus is that you're face won't melt off at Dante's View. It's much cooler at that altitude. It was something like 30 degrees cooler. Keep a close eye on your vehicles temperature.

On a very clear day you can even simultaneously see the highest and the lowest points of the USA.It’s also pleasantly (relatively) cool there in comparison to the rest of Death Valley, given the altitude; so if you’re able to then it’s absolutely walking the short distance to the rocky outlook on the opposite side to the parking lot’s entrance, for even more impressive views.

Dante's View,"I found Death Valley to be enthralling. The hottest, lowest, driest point and yet home to high mountain peaks. We entered the park from the east and drove all the way across, exiting to the west. We walked on the salt flats of Badwater Basin, saw the sand dunes, then drove up through the cooler mountains. If you drive it this way, when you exit the west side you will be directly facing the back side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range which is truly a heart stopping sight. I love this park for its sheer, stark beauty.","June 27, 2016",Possibly my favorite National Park!!,143,"Louisville, Kentucky",5

Dante's View,"09/06/16 – 10/06/16 – Death Valley National ParkThis National Park has many sights to behold and will take time to discover them all…we only went to a few key areas as we were on a very tight time schedule touring around, but what we saw was breath taking and quite hot!When you enter the National Park, you will be required to pay $20 per car from the automated machines. I am not sure how regular vehicles are checked though.This National Park is massive, over 5700 square miles, so it is highly recommended that you do your research first and plan your trip as to what you want to see and do.There are several routes into the park and we were using Beatty as our base but we first entered from Merced.We visited Rhyolite Ghost Town (there are more and probably better than this one), Mesquite Dunes, Stovepipe Wells, Father Crowley Vista, walked to the Salt Flats, Mustard Canyon, Furnace Creek, Zabriskie Point, Dante’s View, Artist’s Drive & Artists Palette amongst others.Save for the particular ghost town we visited, all are definitely worth seeing. I do regret not being able to get to the dried up lake bed called the Racetrack Playa…you will have the opportunity to see the ‘sailing stones’ and the tracks that they leave when they move…fascinating and it is not magic either…but physics.I would imagine that at night the sky is not at all polluted by artificial light which would be perfect for stargazing and some long exposure photo opportunities…we unfortunately did not have enough time. I would strongly suggest that you get here early so as to try and avoid the soaring temperatures that we experienced during the day…up to 119.Make sure that your vehicle is in good working order and this includes the brakes for when travelling down the mountain roads. Extreme heat may cause your brakes to fade...if this happens to you then you will need to stop the car and wait for them to cool down on their own before starting off again.We only saw a fraction of what was on offer…please see the details of the park’s website for further information.The park’s website will tell you important things about the weather at the park and which roads are closed.I would also suggest downloading the Chimani app prior to your visit when you have internet. You will also need to load the map when you have internet access; once this is done you will then have access to the map offline as you will probably have no mobile coverage when in Death Valley.Most points of interest can be driven to nearby and so long as you can park, you can hike the remainder.Allow plenty of time for each point of interest and to find the best spot for capturing the sights on camera.There are general stores located at Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek so you can get snacks and drinks. Alternatively you can bring a picnic to the park or even try frying an egg on a rock!Please bring plenty of water with you and do not underestimate the importance of keeping hydrated here…also taking high energy snacks for hiking is a must. Plan for when things can go wrong…Rangers do patrol the roads (so do not go off-road) but I do not know how regular they do this.Oh yes, take more water with you.There are many marked trails which take you to some various named viewing areas; all are spectacular in their own right. Some are several miles long.Please check the weather before you set out and dress accordingly and always protect yourself from the sun… a hat is usually a good item of clothing that people tend to forget.Please also note that in certain areas there are risks of sand storms which we had to drive through on one occasion.Temperatures were around 48 °C (119 °F) during our brief stay at the Death Valley National Park.","June 21, 2016",The view is spectacular from here...,124,"Bicester, United Kingdom",5

The views are breathtaking and many visitors appear to be extremely pleased when they experience the ultimate views you can take in while there. I have seen no dissapointments in my many travels there.There are several routes up to different levels of this attraction, one of which takes you to the very edge of the overlook area.Bring plenty of water as you walk /hike up to the various points of interest. Even though it doesn't seem like much of a trek, it is and you can get dehydrated quickly if you're not acclimated to the arid conditions.Other than the actual fee charged to be in Death Valley, usually a single fee for 1 car, this attraction is free of charge.","June 10, 2016",Overlooking a vast valley of salt water basins and Southern Death Valley.,92,"Fort Myers Beach, Florida",5

Dante's View,"My husband and I decided to just do a day trip to Death Valley when we were staying in Vegas. It was only a 2 hour drive and at least half of it was very scenic. Because we were strapped for time, we planned out just a few highlights of the park and Dantes View was our first stop. It's about a 15 minute drive off of the main road to get there so it worked out perfectly for us to drive in, hike around and take pictures, drive back and then head further west to get to the visitor's center. We then drove to the badwater basin, then artists drive and then went to Zabrieski point to watch the sunset. We spent maybe 7-8 hours exploring and Dantes View was one of our favorite spots, though it's hard to rate the spots against one another because so many parts of this park seemed so different! But whether you're visiting for a day or a week, make sure you do hike up to the top of the cliffs at Dantes overlooking badwater. Pictures don't do it justice.

Dante's View,"An ideal destination for the sunset, Dante’s Ridge has spectacular panoramic vistas. From the salt flats below, a wide expanse of varied mountain landscape to the bellowy, fast moving cirrus or nimbus clouds, DR is another must be destination for the professional or wannabe photographer. The windy road climbs up to a vantage point. From the parking lot, you can hike down below on your left or ascend to your right. Tie down your hat so it does not get blown away. Bring (and wear) your layers as it gets very cold. For the trail, you can summit at half mile on a moderate 320 feet climb. There were more wildflowers along this route; perhaps because of the cooler temperature during my visit. Location is 17 miles off the main road. NOTE to the hiker or visitor of DV: Always come prepared when you visit the desert. Carry in your person ample water, bug repellent and first aid, layers of clothing, hat, sunscreen, and maps. Bring cell phone and GPS but do not rely on them to rescue you during emergency. Hike during the day and leave plenty of time before darkness arrives. Let someone know of your whereabouts. Never underestimate the dangers in the desert. There are many more tips in the visitor center.

Dante's View,When planning our epic road trip from Albuquerque to Los Angeles my 15 YO daughter asked if we would be anywhere near Death Valley. Really only because Fall Out Boy sings a song about Death Valley so she wanted to check it out. While a little out of the way I humored her and boy was that a good call. One of the most spectacular and memorable stops on our trip. Trip Advisor had Dante's View on the top of the list so of course that is where we headed. Had to stop at visitor center as we were a little confused on how to actually get there. Visitor center was very nice and staff very friendly. Took a pic at the digital displayed temp of 103. As we drove through to get to Dante's View all the views were spectacular but none compared to when we got there. Magnificent!!! On our way out we kept spotting dust devils swirling in the landscape and stopped to watch one form right in front of us. Another memorable spectacle that yielded my fave photo of the trip. I would have loved to see the other sites at this park but our road trip had us on a tight schedule. I hope to make it back there when we have more time to spend. All in all it was at the top of our list of stops on our trip so thanks again Fall Out Boy!,"April 6, 2016",Thanks Fall Out Boy :),8,"Orlando, Florida",5
Dante's View,"We'd had a fairly long drive from Vegas and I was a bit tired in the driving seat, but my wife convinced me that it would be worth the short detour through the desert to see Dante's View. I had imagined Death Valley to be flat, bland and monotonous... I could not have been more wrong. The Death Valley National Park is so, so beautiful it is hard to describe. There were coloured sands, huge mountains, lonely hills and one long strip of road stretching out in front of you... it was an important part of our perfect road trip. Dante's View was so worth it, it was beautiful, stunning and every other superlative for a view you can think of. Do no miss this treat if you're passing through Death Valley, and don't let the desert or the heat put you off. We had a lot of people tell us scare stories before going to the desert, and that's fine fas a gentle warning but so many people told us various things that their warnings became bleak omens of the horrors of the hot, dry death in the desert we were about to foolishly submit to. But I needn't have worried, if your car has air con (they all do) and it fairly new (they all are) and you take plenty of water with you (just in case) then you have nothing to worry about. It's basically the opposite of LA; there are no people, no amenities, no restaurants... in short it was brilliant. We even saw some coyotes on our way, they were wild but they stayed still for us to look at for quite a while.","April 5, 2016",Spectacular!,14,"Warwick, United Kingdom",5

At one point you are at a 14% grade at a windy road. There is plenty of parking at the top. You can hike on either side of the parking lot to see different views. It's amazing to see the white in contrast with the mountains. I think I could have spent a whole day just admiring the views. I can see why it's recommended for sunrise. If you are fortunate to be when the flowers are in bloom, you will find some stunning and different flowers I found nowhere else. I know I've said in my other views that other places are a must. This one is a must, as well. It's just so amazing. Many people have negative feelings towards Death Valley. One look from Dante's View, and you will know that Death Valley is a wonderful place.

Its a fair drive up the hill but as we ascended the last little bit onto the carpark my wife and I both had a loud audible wow. The view is honestly breath taking. Its just a massive expanse of nothing. We took some photos from the carpark and took a little walk down to the left to get some closer photos of the edge of the mountain. Its ideal place to get some awesome photos for the holiday mountain.

But it is still an awesome sight! We wondered about the white covering on the plain of the valley floor, and it turns out to be the salt bed at Badwater Salt bed, the lowest point below sea level in North America.

Dante's View,"Dante's View is a destination, not a stop along a route. You will go up the same road you come back down. Just keep that in mind - it's a bit of a drive and toward the top, the road gets a bit steep. But the view is gorgeous. I couldn't see the people at Badwater from Dante's View and I couldn't see the people on top of Dante's View when standing near the signs at Badwater. But there is no mistaking the view.The park ranger said there were good views of the Super Bloom on the road to Dante's View (during our visit in late March 2016), but we actually got better views on the road to Badwater. Even still, the flowers were amazing to see - unbelievable anything can live in such a harsh environment. We pulled over on the way down from the View and spotted a bunch of yellow flowers on the side of the road. Upon getting out of the car and walking around (carefully), I also spotted white, purple and red flowers too. It was amazing. But you probably won't notice the different flowers unless you walk around....which I highly recommend.There are other spots in DVNP that I prefer to Dante's View, but it was nice to check out. My favorite spots are Mosaic Canyon and Badwater basin. Just as an FYI....if you are visiting in the late afternoon and are able to do so, plan to stay for star gazing (although I would go to a lower altitude). The night we were at DVNP, the Park Rangers had 2 programs (at different locations in the Park) around 8pm and one was for star gazing. Even though it was nearly a full moon and was super bright, once the sun went down, it took quite a long time before the moon was up high enough in the sky to crest over the valley walls (around 9:30pm the night we visted). So it is DARK and wonderful for viewing the stars.","April 1, 2016",Beautiful view of Badwater,245,"Aldie, Virginia",5

Dante's View,"The weather was perfect in February! The view is amazing and well worth the more than 20 mile round trip windy road there and back off the main drag. You can look across the valley and up to Telescope Peak or down into the lowest points in the valley. Either way, the view is surreal and beautiful.","February 29, 2016",Go in February!,297,,5
Dante's View,Not much can really be said about Dante's View other than it is such a wonderful place to get a proper view over Death Valley. It's about half an hour drive on winding but pretty easy roads from Furnace Creek.There is a car park and one of the most breath-taking views I have ever seen. That's about it.,"February 29, 2016",Such a spectacular view,16,UK,5

Dante's View,"A ""fun"" drive near the end, but well worth negotiating the final few hundred feet of 15 degree grade narrow two-lane road up to the parking area (and down again after your visit). A windbreaker and fleece were useful outer garments for my February visit, as well as good hiking shoes. Quite a different perspective from being down in the valley. It's a 13-mile drive in from the highway, mostly slow, on a winding road, so consider this when planning your visit. Thankfully, the road is paved all the way. I can't overemphasize taking care if you hit the trail to the peak; as noted by others, there are lots of opportunities to slip and fall on the crumbly rock and severely hurt yourself.","February 23, 2016",Stunning views,190,"Cheyenne, Wyoming",5

Dante's View,"Came here for sunset and it was amazing. Photos can't do it justice and it's just something that needs to be experienced. Wish I came an hour earlier than the sunset time I found online because it doesn't account for the high peaks the sun creeps behind. There are a couple of short, moderately steep trails you can climb above the parking lot to view the basin floor. For safety's sake, give yourself enough time so you're not coming back to the parking lot on the gravelly trails or driving back down the windy road in the dark.","February 22, 2016",Don't miss this view!,14,California,5
Dante's View,"This is the highest point in the Park and the view from the top is fantastic, Be careful walking in the trail, the loose rocks/gravel can be slippery.

Dante's View,"It's an easy drive up here and there are walks to do when you get here.Even without walking you get to see over the salt basin in the valley, it's a surprising 5,000ft high so a great view.Keep an eye out for the alluvial fans on in the valley, you'll see these if you visit Badwater Basin.Also if you've already walked out on the salt pan at Badwater Basin you'll realise from up here just how short a walk you probably made out there.Well worth a drive up.","February 8, 2016",Amazing view of salt flats and whole valley...,265,"Reading, United Kingdom",5

If you want to you can walk up a few hills nearby, however there really is no need.It's great if you are in a wheelchair as you can see 360 from the flat car park.It was freezing when we were there but truly worth it.If you look down you will see where people are walking out onto the salt at Badwater.

Dante's View,"This is one of my favorite place. I strongly do this if you go to Death Valley. I really mean it. It took 45 minutes from visitor center and combine with Zabriskie Point and 20 Mule Team (closed at the moment). We didn't have the privilege to watch the sunset and sunrise. Even you don't have time to hike, just go to this place, you won't regret.

Dante's View,The view is incredible. It was very windy even though the rest of the park wasnt so be prepared. We hiked out pretty far but occasionally wind gusts make you feel like you will fall. The view is incredible if you dont hike so you should go no matter what. We were there very early in the morning. We rented a car and drove. I would never pay a tour guide when it's less expensive to drive yourself and you can spend as much or as little time as you want at each viewpoint.,"February 8, 2016","Amazing View, Scary if you choose to hike, Chilly in morning.",54,"Clinton, Ohio",5

This view just took my breath away like no other. I was astonished. As mentioned in the title I would not have been surprised to see the Millennium Falcon scream past with TIE Fighters in pursuit. It had an interplanetary look and feel to it. Very calming and beautiful. I spent hours here perched up on the summit to watch the sunset. I never uttered a word the entire time. Came back the next day for the sunrise.","January 24, 2016",You wouldnt be surprised if the Millennium Falcon screamed past..,23,Australia,5

We made it our last stop but wish we had made it an earlier stop so that we could have hiked out the trail. The overlook is accessible to all. The hiking or trails are easy/moderate but you have to watch your footing and be able to walk up and down gravely slopes comfortably.

Well worth the drive from Las Vegas, and better than the pictures. Have to see it in person to get the full effect. Every corner we turned, was another breathtaking view! Loved the untouched beauty there. We stayed a couple days just outside the park. If I went again, I would stay in the park. No rooms available when we went. Loved it there!

Dante's View,"I am writing specific to the Winter / Spring-season...Leaving Vegas *early in the morning* with family is difficult.So, if you left Vegas around 9:30am or after, and *IF* have seen Grand Canyon, I suggest you skip Dante's view - for the #2 and #3 spots.Also, in winter - the road up to Dante's view is ICED UP!!! Warning, do not try driving on it. I saw many cars (all 2-wheel drive) & even a cadillac SUV get stuck trying to go up the steep curved road.-----------------Fall/Winter/Spring is really comfortable time to visit Death Valley. Do bring a warm sweatshirt.Dante's peak can get really cold..Summer-time offers you crazy hot temperatures (an attraction in itself) + longer visiting (day-light) hours.Otherwise, for family visits, Winter/Spring is great choice, simply because the family can spend more time outside the car - in the middle of the day!WARNING: Summer or Winter... does not matter... the bathrooms are very far away, and have no running water.-----------------If you are looking at a short single-day trip, I suggest you drive DIRECTLY all the way to Badlands (#3 on must-see - it's the Salt Flats below sea level). That is a good 3.5 hrs Drive from Vegas (Non-stop).You will easily spend 45 mins at Badlands - as kids get a great kick out of being under the sea level.-----------------On the way back from Badland, you HAVE to go through Artist's drive - as this is a bigger hit with families than Dante's peak. Drive slow, take your time and enjoy the view.-----------------Independent of whether it's summer or winter... get to Zabriske Point AT LEAST 2 hours before sunset for best photographs (30 mins return trip from Badlands).Sunset is 3:30-4pm during Dec-Jan period.Give yourself about 45 minutes at Zabriske Point. There is some kid-friendly hiking areas nearby this spot (you will see lots of cars around these areas).-----------------Add up the times above: 3.5 + 0.75 + 0.5 + 0.75 = 5.5 hrs ==> 6 hours is not much time during winter. It will get dark quite early (due to the mountain ranges) by 4:30pm.If it gets dark when returning back to Vegas, you can try getting back to Vegas via Highway 95 - follow the official signs to Vegas (the official speed limit if 75 all the way, straight roads, so you have a easier drive back and still take the same amount of time)","December 29, 2015",Planning your day (with family) - winter season,7,"Bridgewater, New Jersey",4

This was one of the disappointments of the trip, but we found so many other things to do, and will do this next time. Taking photos doesn't do it justice but you have to see it for yourself.

It's not on the way to anything else. This means you have to go all the way back down and onto the main road to continue on to other Death Valley sights. I think it was worth it, though. However, it's quite the commitment to make the round-trip from Las Vegas. You have to really want to see Death Valley to make this a trip from Vegas. Do look out for the bees up there! There's a sign in the parking lot warning about the bees. And sure enough, they were all around our parked vehicle. They seemed aggressive.

Dante's View,"Dante's View is one of several places/stops in Death Valley to see. We saved it until last, after driving to see other places of interest in the park and I'm glad we did. We got there just before sunset and it was actually very windy and a little chilly which was a nice reprieve from the 120 degree temps in the park the day we visited, July 29, 2015. I was a little nervous since we waited until about an hour before sunset to visit because its a 12 mile winding drive up the mountain to reach the top. when we got there we were not the only ones, so I felt better. The view was beautiful. Driving down from Dante's View we spotted a jack rabbit! One thing to notice is the quiet when you are in the park...something you don't get when living in the city where there's always noise. Also noteworthy to me was Artists Palette...be sure to drive through that if you visit Death Valley. And if you are visiting many of the national parks in the Las Vegas, AZ, UT area, you might as well purchase the year pass that gets you into all the national parks for one year from date of purchase.

I wouldn't, nor is it allowed, to bring any towed items to the top, nor any large vehicles like a large camper. The last 1/2 mile is steep and very windy.

Make sure you take plenty of drink water though. If I were to do it again I would aim to get to the RV park early/late evening so you can experience the night sky and out of the searing heat. Also would recommend that if you intend to visit a lot of national parks buy an annual ticket because it works out cheaper, or keep you receipts from each park and the Rangers will refund or tot them up so you don't overpay.

Since it is one of the first places we visited, we were not familiar with the other attractions that you can see from above. It would have been better if we knew what Badwater Basin, etc. were before going to Dante's view, so we could recognize those from above.

Dante's View,"We only had one night's stay in Death Valley, and our time was limited, but I was determined not to miss this, and I'm glad I didn't!It's an incredible view. Personally, I found it more impressive than the Grand Canyon. We went not too long before sunset and there were only about 4 other cars in the car park at the top.If I went again I would go earlier in the day, as I think the view would be even more impressive when the sun is higher in the sky, and there are fewer shadows on the valley floor. It would mean there'd probably be more people up there (I'm guessing) and that you would have to take care in your car to give way to people coming the opposite way to you (the road narrows near the top), but it's well worth the effort. We passed people on the way back who must have been going up there specifically to watch the sun go down.","July 5, 2015","Fantastic view, well worth the drive!",92,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",5

Dante's View,"The entrance to Dante’s View is located near the southeastern entrance of Death Valley National Park on Dante's View Road. This blacktop road is 13 miles long and can be accessed directly off of highway 190. It is also located about 30 miles west of the town of Death Valley Junction. Death Valley National Park is located about 125 miles northwest of Las Vegas. This viewpoint is about 5,000 feet above the Valley floor (but this is not the highest viewpoint in the park). If you enter the park from the southeast this is the first place you should visit (although you could visit on the way out of you are leaving from the same gate).I visited Dante’s View with my wife on a Friday morning in late May and enjoyed the fantastic views from the top of the Black Mountains. Since the elevation is higher it was a little cooler up there and most people were wearing sweatshirts (plus it was a cooler day). After driving to Dante’s View parking area it is only a short 100-200 yard walk to the end of the path (where the vies are the best).Overall the views from the top of this mountain are fantastic and Dante’s View is a must see attraction in Death Valley.

Dante's View,"Death Valley National Park is located east of the Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada. It was established on October 31, 1994. Death Valley National Park is the largest national park in the lower 48 states with a massive 3,373,063 acres (13,650.30 km2). Death Valley is North America's driest and hottest spot and has the lowest elevation on the continent – 86 m (282 ft) below sea level. Dante's View is the most popular attraction in Death Valley National Park because it can be reached by car. It also provides the best panoramic views of the Death Valley. This lookout is on top of the Black Mountains at 1,669 m (5,475 ft).Dante's View was the last stop of our Death Valley trip while we headed to Las Vegas. It can be accessed via CA 190 and then turning right onto the Furnace Creek Rd and Dante’s View Rd to the parking lot. We arrived there around 2:30 pm, and the weather was sunny. After few minutes of walking, we reached a number of overlooks, which gave the best views of southern half of the national park. There were interpretive signs pointing out major highlights in the valley and its surroundings. From the edge of the overlook, the well-known attraction, Badwater, was just 1,699 m (5,475 ft) below. We also saw miles of salt flats, the 3,368 m (11,049 ft) tall Telescope Peak, and the roads that look as thin as strings. The rocks around the overlook were colorful - there were many shades of yellow/brown/gray and contrasted with the enormous flat salt flats and sand in the valley beneath.The drive from the CA 190 is about 21 km (13 mi). The first 12 km (7.5 mi) is fairly level, and the last 8.9 km (5.5 mi) is steep, climbing from 914 m to 1,661 m (3,000 ft to 5,450 ft). The last 8.9 km (5.5 mi) does not allow trailers or long vehicles to travel on it. Even with its extremes, the park still receives nearly a million visitors each year. The best time for photography is early morning when it offers the best lighting for photographs at Dante's View.","May 22, 2015",Best Panoramic Views of the Death Valley,666,"Taipei, Taiwan",4

Just about everything you see is pretty cool and there's tons of hiking trails.

Dante's View,"A great first stop for a visit to Death Valley. You get amazing views and a great overview of the area. From the dramatic elevation changes, to the highly varied geology of the area you get a preview of all Death Valley has to offer from here. It was especially dramatic the day we visited as you could contrast the snow dusted Telescope Peak with the salt encrusted Badwater Flats directly under it. A definite must stop for anyone visiting Death Valley.","March 25, 2015",Your First Stop For Your Death Valley Experience,279,"San Diego, California",5
Dante's View,Be prepared for a cooler temperature and a wind that comes up from the basin. The road out to the viewpoint is twisty and narrow at the last 1/4 mile but does not require a 4-wd. The wildflowers along this road were the best this week from anywhere in the park...not amazing but the best. You can see current mining operations far from the road on the way.

Dante's View,"We were unexpectedly stunned by the beauty of Death Valley and Dante's View is exhibit 1 for that. You have to burn some time driving there, but don't pass this place up.We drove in from Vegas and arrived about 10:30am. Hardly any cars encountered on the drive in, and maybe a dozen were in the ample parking area.The views are superb. Also, if you are able, consider taking the scrambling trails on either side of the parking lot. Both go on for quite aways, and each side offers additional 5 star views. Be careful on them though--big drop offs. I wouldn't allow a child on them. There is a restroom in the parking lot below the main viewing area.","March 22, 2015",Loved It,270,"Des Moines, Iowa",5

Dante's View,Although we have visited Death Valley a few times this was the first time we had been to Dante's view. The views up and down the valley are worth the trip but there are also two paths one to the right which apparently goes on for about four miles and one to the left. Neither are recommended for anyone with a fear of heights as they are not very wide and at points on them a slip could send you tumbling down some very steep slopes. That said I managed some distance on both. I was more comfortable on the one leading to the left but managed to get to a viewpoint on the one on the right and we were passed by a group obviously intent on doing the proper hike. If you cannot manage either it is still worth doing the drive for the experience of being over 5000 feet above the valley floor.,"March 21, 2015","Stunning view, well worth visiting",47,Canterbury,5

Dante's View,"Zabriske point was closed during our visit, so we can't compare, but the panorama here, looking over the Badwater section of Death Valley and across to the mountains, was beautiful. Ignore advice that you need to arrive at sunrise, unless sunrise itself is important to you or you're here in the blazing summer. At that hour, most of the view is in shadow. Best view is about two hours after sunrise, when you can see better into the valley and get more light-shadow contrasts on surrounding features.","March 18, 2015",Panorama,13,Chicago,5

Dante's View,"Dante's view is rated as the top attraction in Death Valley in Tripadvisor for good reason. The view illustrates better than anywhere else in the park what Death Valley is ... barren and stark piece of arid valley between rugged mountains but gorgeous in it's own way.It is basically a 30 mile drive to and fro drive from the main park road (CA 190). The drive is easy although it has several sharp bends and the gradient is almost 15% towards the end. There's a parking lot at the top of the peak, rest rooms, picnic tables and 2 short hike trails that takes you towards the edge of the peak from where you can see dramatic panoramic view of the park. On a clear day you can see both the lowest (Badwater Basin) and highest (Mt Whitney) points of continuous US.If you are travelling from east The Dante's view comes before you reach the Furnace Creek visitor center. Try to visit this place as early as you can in the morning if you plan to hike the trails since it can get very hot later in the day. We visited in late Feb when the mornings were still cold and found less than 10 cars in the parking, so we could enjoy this fantastic place and its breathtaking views almost all by ourselves.","March 17, 2015",Fabulous views of a fabulous park,82,Phoenix,5
Dante's View,"It was quite chilly up there. It was overcast and cooler on the valley floor but an expected 20 degrees cooler at the top of the mtn. Well it was downright COLD!

You look directly down on the Bad Water area which is 282 feet below sea level. Be sure and bring your binoculars. Also a must is to visit Scotty's Castle. The National Parks tour is well worth your time and is very informative and enjoyable. I am one who usually doesn't enjoy 'house tours' as such, but the young guides are well informed and sharp. Also you need to visit the Ubehebe Crater, a very unusual sight, which is only a couple of miles from Scotty' Castle.","March 17, 2015",An awesome introduction to Death Valley,18,"Cedar City, Ut",5

From the heights of Dante's View you can see from Badwater (-294 ft) to Telescope Peak (ca. 11,500 ft) and up and down the valley. You can't believe it until you've seen it.

Dante's View,"Death Valley National Park is one of the rawest and most underdeveloped national parks I have been to. One of the reasons is it is the hottest and driest of the national parks in the United States. Fortunately, we went there during winter and I highly recommend it. Hiking is not fun when it is hot hehe!The drive towards Dante's view was around 25 minutes and our GPS was not working well so we thought we got lost because of lack of directions. Fortunately, we saw more cars the deeper we got. I was amazed by breadth and depth of Dante's view! From Dante's View, you can see the lowest point (Badwater Basin) and the highest point (Mount Whitney) in USA! How cool is that!Fun facts:How did Dante's View get its name? Dante's View is named from Dante Alighieri, who wrote the Divine Comedy. In the Divine Comedy, there is a description of the nine circles of Hell, the seven terrace of Purgatory and the nine spheres of Paradise. I guess it is a metaphor for seeing the lowest and highest point in US!What sci-fi movie was filmed in Dante's View? Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope was filmed in Dante's View.

Dante's View,"This was my first stop having visited the Death Valley National Park for my first time. Dante's View was the first attraction once entering the park and was worth the trip. Even on a ""not so pleasant"" day, the view was quite incredible. In addition to look at the view, there is also a hiking path to different mountain top views that you could take and easily spend 1-2 hours walking around and taking in the sights. I was only there for one day so I wanted to see as many sights as I could before it got dark by 6pm so I was there for only 15-20 minutes. One thing I can add to my bucket list is that there were snow flakes flying around. So pretty cool that I went to one of the hottest places in the US and when I was there it snowed. Of all my stops at Death Valley, this was #2 (Sand Dunes #1).","March 8, 2015",Crazy but true... Snowed at Dante's View,37,"Dublin, Ohio",5

Most impressive is the view of the Badwater area. At eye level, it is stark dirt and small ridges.

Binoculars would be useful to pick out details, but the view conveys the size of the valley and the contrast between the salt pans and barren valley floor and the mountains that encircle it.

Dante's View,"The road from Las Vegas to Dante's View takes over two hours, more or less. Make sure to drive a reliable car and have plenty of drinking water, preferably in a cooler. In September, the temperatures were around 47 degrees Celsius (about 118 Fahrenheit). Getting out of the car feels like stepping into a well heated oven, with no mits on! However, with a full tank of gas and all the modern traveler comforts... the trip is pleasant and... different. The highway is very well maintained, a bit spooky though, as you may not see another car going by for a while. Just the hot desert on both sides and the straight road ahead. Getting up to the view point is quite a steep climb, by car, on a two-way narrow and winding lane. However, the overlook offers an awesome view of the valley below, under the hazy, hot air. Old cowboy movies from one's childhood come to mind and yes, it does feel dangerous. I cannot imagine how someone can possibly survive if left in the middle of this land, the hottest on earth, according to what I read about it. It is definitely worth the day trip into the Death Valley National Park. The fee is paid once only, at the road entrance into the park, shortly before turning towards Dante's View. To make the most of your day, go back to the main road and continue to Furnace Creek. There are a few other places on the way, quite unique in their uncanny beauty.","December 11, 2014",Impressive!!!,200,"Mississauga, Canada",5
Dante's View,"From Dante’s View, over 1 mile (1.6k) above Badwater, one takes in an amazing view of nearly the entire Death Valley, salt pan and all, as it disappears into the horizon to the north. Looking directly across the valley, 21 miles (34k) away, one sees Telescope Peak, at 11,049 feet (3,368m) and snow capped much of the year, the highest mountain in the Panamint Range, and an unobstructed view of a vertical relief, from valley floor to mountain top, of twice the depth of the Grand Canyon. It is truly an amazing sight, especially at daybreak or sunset, but any time in the morning when the sun is to your back, and should not be missed by anyone visiting Death Valley. The best views are not from the walk along the front of the parking area but from the obvious short trail to south of the parking area leading to a number of rocky outcrops that offer even more spectacular views. Dante’s view is accessed by taking the 13 mile (21k) long Dante’s View Road which is located along CA 190, 12 miles (19.3k) south of Furnace Creek. After about 7 miles (11.3k) on Dante’s View Road, there is a trailer parking area after which vehicles longer than 25 feet (7.6m) are prohibited and for the final 0.25 mile (0.4k), the road twists up a steep grade to the parking area.","December 10, 2014",The Full Monty,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

You can see the whole of the Badwater basin and the majority of the valley floor. You really get the feeling of the vastness and extent of Death Valley from up here. So many photo opportunities and is the first of the many 'must do's'. Do not miss this experience!!! We went on 4th August and had experienced flash floods on SR 190 resulting in driving through deep water and round boulders washed on to the road.

I decided after reading previous trip advisor posts that I wanted to watch the sunset from Dainties view. I'm glad I did, the sunset it's self was a little underwhelming but it's an incredible place to look out over the park and bad water below. It was also way cooler up there which was a nice break from the valley below. It was very peaceful as well, very few people up there and it was so quiet.

It was pretty awesome to stand on the peak and look down across the southern Death Valley basin (the salt flats on the basin floor were 282 feet below sea level). I think the peak stands at 5476 feet, so the salt flats beneath looked tiny in the vastness of the valley.","July 26, 2014","Not the highest, but beautiful",899,"Lake Forest, California",5

Dante's View,"Dante's view is incredible for many reasons. There is the obvious and stunning vista on offer - a 360 degree panoramic view incorporating the valley itself, the Panamint and Sierra Nevada Ranges on the west side and the magnificent backdrop of endless Canyon Ranges as you look east over the state of Nevada.The view is accessible to anyone with a car. Having a paved road to the summit is actually quite remarkable when you think about the conditions. It's a great drive up to the summit and there's a large viewing area with plenty of parking, a well maintained road, tight switch backs, crash barriers and plenty of signs to share information.On the valley floor, the temp was 115 F and at the summit, the temp as 101 F (mid July). The wind was hot and strong like an industrial hairdryer. You certainly won't need a jacket or a scarf if you go in summer! From the parking area there are a couple of short hiking trails (one south west, one north east). The tracks are steep inclines & declines, the footing is pretty loose gravel and of course in summer its hot so take care. I hiked both ways (about 10 minutes SW and 5 minutes NE) and the view was different enough to justify the exertion.Best thing about this place? Once you have taken the mandatory pictures (which never do justice to what your eyeballs and brain process) put your camera away and take time to reflect on where you are. How long did it take to form? How long was it around like this before people 'discovered' it and how long it will be there after we've all departed? I stayed for about 90 minutes all up. I saw at least a dozen people drive up, get out of the car, take a bunch of pictures by the signs and get in the car again ... sure - they ticked the box and had a trophy picture but they missed the point.Taking time to stop and just 'be' will let you appreciate where you are and what you're seeing. It keep things in perspective, which is unfortunately simple to lose in the hustle-bustle of modern life. When you can recognise that the mountain you're standing on, high above one of the most extreme places on earth, is actually moving (albeit slowly) you'll have connected with a fundamental truth. It's all about the journey, not the destination my friend ...","July 24, 2014",Take time to see beyond the photo opportunity,35,"Melbourne, Australia",5

I came to Death Valley to say that I had been to the lowest spot in North America, but the highlight of my visit was Dante's View. You should go too.Vehicles over 25 feet and trailers are prohibited from the last couple of miles on the road and you should heed that warning.

This is one of the best - if not THE best - views of the valley. You can look far up and down the main valley and across at the range to the west, and it is simply breathtakingly stunning. This viewpoint is best in the morning with the sun still in your back. You can drive up – all paved – to the parking lot, but trailers and very long vehicles – such as those behemoth RVs – can’t negotiate the last part with the very steep and tight switchbacks. There’s a parking lot below the peak where trailers can be left. There’s a good view from right there at the parking look at the top, but a trail to north and south leads to some great spots from which to see what feels like all of Death Valley.

Dante's View,This view appeals to specific groups in my opinion. As a hiker I like going on challenging hikes in solitude and being rewarded with excellent views at the top as a reward for the effort. Dante's view is more of a tourist destination. This is a good place for families or people who are not physically able to go on difficult hikes to get this type of view and the tradeoff is that it is crowded with people. You drive 13 slow miles to get here and park in a parking lot and take pictures of the view down at Badwater surrounded by a lot of people. For a less crowded view you can hike up to Dante's Peak in a few minutes by following the trail out of the parking lot to the right which may or may not also be crowded depending on the physical abilities of other people up there at that moment. If you are a hiker you will be better served by hiking Telescope Peak and getting treated with a much better view of this area and more with less people.

Dante's View,"Dante's view is about a 45 minute (28 mile) drive from Furnace Creek Inn or Ranch with paved roads all the way. Your car will get a work out, as in those 28 miles the road climbs to 5,476 and at Furnace creek your pretty close to sea level to start with. Only the last couple of miles is curvy and narrow but other than the last 1/4 mile you don't have those big drop off's on the side of the road that make some people nervous. DO NOT BRING RV'S OR TRAILERS. Along Dante's view road there are a couple of places where you can leave your trailer. This is highly recommended so your poor little car doesn't have to drag it up 5,000 feet only to turn around and have to keep it from pushing you back down too fast on the return trip. If you have an RV, there is a parking lot about a 1/4 mile before the view point where you can park and then hike up the last bit to the viewpoint. If you have an RV that is longer than, say, a pickup truck DO NOT ATTEMPT THAT LAST 1/4 MILE with it. It is very steep, narrow and very curvy.Once you get to the top there is a very large parking lot with death valley spread out below you. You can see a grand and spectacular view from the parking lot, or you can take a walk. From Dante’s view you can see pretty much the entire expanse of Death Valley from just north of Badwater all the way up to the Ubehebe crater area. At the viewpoint you are directly above Badwater, more than 1 mile straight down. You can’t see Badwater from the parking lot though. Most folks take a walk down the hill at the South end of the parking lot (left end as you look at the valley) for a slightly to somewhat better view. In addition to taking a walk down the hill at the South end of the parking lot, you can also take a trail along a ridge from the North end of the parking lot. This trail takes you to the top of Dante’s Peak where you can see much more of the valley and even shoot a wonderful 360 degree panorama that, on a clear day, can include Mt. Whitney (highest peak in the lower 48 states), Mt Charleston near Las Vegas, Nevada’s Great Basin, and Badwater, the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere.Here are some tips. Well, one in particular. Depending on time of year, when you're in the valley you will be warm. When we left Furnace Creek before dawn one day it was 75f. On another day when we left for Dante's view in late afternoon it was 85f. On both days there was barely a slight breeze. The conditions at Dante's view were quite different. Not only was the temperature in mid to low 50's the wind was raging. I don't have a wind gauge but I'd be surprised if it was less than 45 mph. We're talking gale force. When walking into it I was leaning over at a 45 degree angle to keep from being blown over backwards. The wind was coming straight up from the valley floor and across the ridge we were on. Fortunately we had our winter jackets and gloves in the car, but even so, after about 10 minutes my wife was satisfied to see the view from inside the car while I braved the elements to photograph. I walked down the hill to a place where there was a jumble of rocks. I climbed to the top (about 12 feet up) and found a spot where I could set up my tripod behind the rocks where there was less wind with jut the camera peeking over the top of the rocks (and in the gale) for a view of the valley.OK, so what about photographing from Dante's view. In the morning the sun rises behind you and in the afternoon the sun sets behind the Panamint range on the other side of the valley. In mid day you're pretty much out of luck photographically. The valley is very light colored with large snow white salt flats. The hillsides are also very light colored and the sky is usually cloudless and very bright. In mid day there just isn't any contrast you can use to show textures, patterns or the contours of land forms. .As the sun moves, deep shadows form on one side of the valley or the other making proper exposure impossible. If you get a good (clear sky) sunrise it is spectacular as the shadow of the ridge you’re standing on creeps down the mountain side on the far side of the valley. At sunset, shoot the sunny near side of the valley or if you’re blessed with some clouds the sunset of the mountains on the far side (which will be pure silhouette in your photos)If you're faced with the problem of brilliant brights and coal black shadows, the only option is bracketing and HDR. Take 3 or more shots without moving the camera at different exposures that are at least 1.3 stops apart. 1.7 or 2.0 stops may actually work better. Then combine those shots using HDR software. Some cameras have such software built-in.Even if you don’t photograph, come here in the early morning as well as the late afternoon. The experience is quite different at these two different times.If you found this information useful in your decision making process, you gleaned information you may not otherwise have discovered, or you just enjoyed reading it and appreciate the time I put into writing it, please give me a ""helpful"" vote.

In fact, although experienced hikers, we turned back before the top (just too close to the edge for us), and instead walked the ridge in the other direction from the parking lot - views just as good, and a nice wide path allowing you to stay further from the edge.

It's worth the approx 15 minute drive as the top suddenly opens out into this wonderful vista, showing the salt plains of Badwater stretching out below. You can walk a little but need good soles on your footwear. Great for a picnic and a few photographs. The toilet facilities are not wonderful and are back down the road a short way.

This time we were much more relaxed and so it was top of our 'to visit' list. It is absolutely stunning, a completely different kind of beauty from the likes of the Grand Canyon or Zion or Bryce. Although it was a little hazy, we just stood and looked at the vastness of Death Valley - we could even see the Badwater road below.

Dante's View,"It's a special thing when you can stand over a mile high at the edge of Death Valley looking nearly straight down at the lowest point in America, ""Badwater"" at minus 292 feet below sea level. ""Wow"" was our first impression and it was similar to the reaction we felt when first gazing across Crater Lake Rim and The Grand Canyon. Dante's View is a few miles off the highway going between Death Valley Junction and Furnace Creek. After a steady climb on good paved road you are advised to leave any towed RV's in the parking area a mile below the viewpoint. The final climb is a 15% grade. The temperature at that altitude was cool and there were trails off to the side of the parking area where if you wanted, additional hiking was possible. We did the first leg of the uphill trail and it gave us a dramatic view of the parking area with great additional photo opportunities. I'd be careful with kids along as there are steep areas. There are no amenities at Dante's View parking area. Restrooms are a mile back down from the summit. It's all about the view and as a side trip, oh, what a treat it is.","June 7, 2013",Breathtaking Panoramic Vista,79,"Roseburg, Oregon",5

It was very hot when we went but that made the scenery even more intense.I sat on the cliff edge for a good 10 minutes, slowing the drivel of my mind and soaking up the sight.

Dante's View,"Death Valley was beautiful and a dry, warm, blue- sky tonic to Seattle's wet, cool, grey skies.We rented a Jeep Liberty in Las Vegas which allowed us to travel many gravel roads. The Titus Canyon drive is the most amazing drive of my life; every turn, dip and hill climb was a new feast for the eyes.Scotty's Castle was a historical, informative tour. Darwin Falls hike, outside of Panamint, yields pretty little falls and grotto that serve as the water supply for Panamint Springs Resort (so stay out of the water) and and many birds. Also visited Ash Meadows to walk the boardwalks and spot birds there and by the lake. The springs are gorgeous colors much like the Caribbean or geysers at Yellowstone NP. Mosaic canyon is another beautiful hike, especially if you like viewing marble. Down Emigrant Canyon on a side spur road we saw a herd of fifteen big horned sheep and visited the Kilns and Eureka Mine.The ranch was a great place for us to stay. We loved our patio with the two big rockers and enjoyed our morning coffee there each day. We used the frig to keep things cool and ate breakfast and packed picnic lunches . Dinners were bought in the dinner: nothing special but it was OK. The Ranger programs in the evening around the gas fire pits were fun. The Furnace Creek is an oasis and the swimming pool water is the best!!! I love to swim but often the level of chlorine is offensive. The pool at the Ranch is spring fed and it has an inlet and outlet and I was told that the water is exchanged three times per day with a little chlorine added. That is about as good as it gets. There were always chaise lounges available and plenty of room for me to swim laps too. The towels are not by the poolside but rather at the registration area. My soaked pool towel would dry out quickly on the rocking chair at our unit and so I could conserve and use the one pool towel for our six days there.

I'll be honest, we were nervous about driving up to 5,000+ feet in the mountains, afraid of winding roads with steep drop-offs. This was one of the easiest roads in a national park that I have encountered - trust me! It is a nice, smooth ride to the top, with just the last little bit rising a little more steeply. Don't let some other reviews fool you, it's nothing to be afraid of, the switchbacks aren't anything drastic, and there are no major drop-offs (just when you actually reach Dante's View and you are already in the parking lot). So, if you are visiting Death Valley, you should really find the time to make it up here and soak in the true beauty of this park. The trails to the left and right of the parking lot just take you a little farther away from any crowds that may be lingering in the parking lot and you get a peaceful view all to yourself.

Dante's View,"I have hiked and seen great summits and views; however the stark contrast in elevation and the lack of humidity allow you to truly see forever. Along with Zabriskie and Badwater, this is a have to do. You simply can't find this other places. Also anyone can get here as the view is accesible by car. However the hikes to the south and north will enhance your visit if you can make them. Please note by the pictures, it is cold in March here, probably 25 degrees cooler than Badwater. The kids really enjoyed this as well as the hike along the rocks.","April 1, 2012",One of the greatest views,459,"Pensacola, Florida",5

Dante's View,"This is the best high vantage point vista in Death Valley. The road takes you to a parking lot right next to the look out point so no walking is needed to see the view. That being said, you can walk up a couple of other High points off either side of the parking lot for even more spectacular views. Morning is a great time to see the softer light and shadows cast by the rising sun. Lastly, you can get a good view of the salt flats in Badwater just below...which makes the distance between the peak and Badwater significant since Badwater is almost 300 ft below sea level. Highly recommended.","February 25, 2012",Must see vista...morning is best,31,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

The air is cooler here, so if it is a hot day, it will give you a break from the heat. There are views from the parking lot and then you can walk down and up to the other view point.

It is the private mining town of Ryan. When you get to Dante's View there are two parking lots. The lower lot has a pit toilet. Park in the upper parking and you don't even have to walk far to get a good view. But for better pictures, walk up the hill to your left.

Be careful driving since there are many blind corners and if you go off the road you will hit rocks very quickly. The view at the top shows the valley below with the salt flats and other mountains. The day we were there it was crystal clear and almost no wind but 100 degrees F. A gps is beneficial plus get a full tank of gas before you leave populated areas because if you need gas in the park it is 5.79 a gallon! Bring a gallon or two of water also if you want to leave your car to walk around. The moisture will be sucked right out of you, drink lots. You can take a short hike up from the parking area to be even higher, caution tho since the trail is just a rocky path.

Dante's View,"If you're coming from Nevada through Death Valley Junction on the 190, it's on the way in. Do not skip this. It's a twisty, windy road, especially at the end, but very driveable. It also worth it. What an amazing view of Death Valley. You can see much of the valley from this point. You are almost directly over Badwater, and can see Furnace Creek and beyond. Across, you'll get a great view of the Panamint mountains, and even a bit of the Sierra Nevadas in the back.The geology of the valley make this view amazing, with the salt flats below, alluvial fans across, an oasis or two in the distance. And once you're done admiring the view, look around. There are unique animals and plants around that you won't find in the valley due to the elevation. Oh, and it's a little cooler up there, so bring a sweater.Do not visit Death Valley without taking in this view. Absolutely amazing!","September 12, 2011",Do not skip this!,15,Ottawa,5

Dante's View,"I found Dante's View to be the highlight of Death Valley. The view is superb- you're 5000 feet off the valley floor, and valley is about 6 miles wide. Because of the elevation, Dante's View can be quite comfortable- when I went it was 80 degrees at the View while it was 104 at the valley floor. I repeatedly lost cell signal and GPS signal on the drive up so don't rely on a GPS. Be sure to grab a park map at the ranger station in Furnace Creek or at the Southeast Park entrance on CA-190 (you have to pass one of them to get to the Dante's View turnoff). The turnoff from CA-190 for Dante's view is well marked and easy to find as long as you're looking and not relying on a GPS.The view itself is great, and as impressive as the west view is over the valley, I actually preferred the view to the east of the Funeral Mountains. Be sure to fill up with gas as there's very few options for miles. If you're coming from Las Vegas, fill up in Pahrump as they have inexpensive gas, especially when compared to the gas station in Furnace Creek.","August 25, 2011",Aptly named destination,17,Washington DC,5
Dante's View,"Death Valley is an amazing sight and to feel that heat is something you just can't imagine unless you're out in it! We took a day to drive through the Valley on our way to Las Vegas. Around every corner there is a different landscape and some fantastic scenery that is starkly beautiful. Plan well with water, snacks and gas as there are few stopping places. We stocked up at Stovepipe Wells where we paid our park fee. An experience not to be missed but due to the intense heat we were restricted mostly to driving and 'oohing and ahhing' over the scenery rather than spending time outside.","August 25, 2011",118 degrees - but wow!,26,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",5

Dante's View,"""Wow"" was my wife and my first reaction when we got off our SUV in Dante's View's parking lot. The view of the valley was unbelievable. Badwater, Telescope Peak and Furnace Creek are all within sights. The huge salt pan and the amazing vertical drop from Telescope Peak to Badwater was particularly stunning (almost 2 miles!). Combined with sunset lights and shadows, the endless mountain range to the South of the view point was even more dramatic. It was easily our favorite spot of the National Park.Personally I think evening is the best time to go the Dante's View. At the view point the temperature is considerably cooler (almost 25F cooler than Furnace Creek on the day I stopped by) - I guess it's a great place to escape from the heat during the afternoon too.","July 5, 2011",You haven't been to DV if you missed this vista,13,"Jersey City, New Jersey",5
Dante's View,"We drove in from Las Vegas along the Badwater Basin road so we had walked out onto the saltpans before heading up to Dante’s.It is the best view and my overall pick in the Park available on the paved roads. The Badwater Basin and the surrounding mountains from up here look magnificent.Driving up is scenic and if you don't head up there for sunrise or sunset the road is fairly empty.From the carpark there a couple of hiking trails to different lookouts.One is fairly easy however, the other can be a bit rocky and uneven and if you don't have a head for heights, it may be a little daunting. We did it OK taking our time and the views were worth it for a different perspective. People look like ants from up here as they follow the well-worn track walking to the huge saltpan.It's a view not to miss and even if you go during the day and not early morning or evening it is one of the Park highlights.Enjoy your visit!","June 5, 2011",The views are worth the drive....,674,Australia,5

Dante's View,"After driving from Vegas in the morning to Scottys Junction, We had lunch at Furnace Creek, and then proceeded to Zabriske point, which I must say was pretty cool too. But upon arrival at the junction to Dante's View, I was conflicted as to whether the 26 mile detour would be worth it. Let me say that it was the most awe inspiring views i have ever seen in person. The final 1/4 mile up 4 or 5 switchbacks, and then to the top truly took my breath away! It feels as if the wholeworld dropped out from under the car.Spent about an hour there. Could have stayed all day!!! One of the neat trivia things about it is that if you look hard enough to the northwest, you can see Mt Whitney, and right below, Badwater, the highest and lowest points in the lower 48 all in one stop. Whitney is easier to see with binos, but if you know what you are looking for and where to look, you can see it with the naked eye on a clear dayBONUS... third week in April provided many photo ops of desert wildflowers along this road....

Try walking a bit beyond the car park in either direction for the best vantage points. There are a few picnic tables and primitive toilets near the car park but no other facilities. Carry your own toilet paper in Death Valley, the park bathrooms outside the towns don't provide this! Don't underestimate the effect of wind chill either! In the middle of winter we were warm in shorts and t-shirts down in the valley but up at Dante's view it was at least 10 degrees cooler and with a strong wind blowing it was easily another 10 degrees colder than that.","January 31, 2010",Fun drive and fantastic view but take a jacket!,1175,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",5

There's not much to do once you get up there other than get out of the car and marvel, but that was more than enough.
