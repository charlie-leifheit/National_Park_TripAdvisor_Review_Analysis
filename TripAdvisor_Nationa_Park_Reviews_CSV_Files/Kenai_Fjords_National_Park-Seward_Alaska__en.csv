Kenai Fjords National Park,"Spectacular views, especially if you take a boat tour out to Holgate Glacier. We took the 11:30 - 5:30 tour and saw at least two orca pods, a humpback whale and numerous sea lions. This was our favorite part of the trip to Alaska!","October 16, 2019",Don't Miss this part of Alaska,28,felix15,5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"Nice walk. Saw bears, eagle and salmon. Walk was not too log and was on flat land. Nice waterfall at the Glacier.","October 10, 2019",Beautiful,2,"Palmdale, California",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"I experienced Kenai Fjords by hiking a glacier. So we had the opportunity to see the interior of the park, rather than seeing it from a boat tour. The trip was both beautiful and sad. The beauty of the mountains is hard to duplicate any where in the Lower 48. Every turn in the road brought another breathtaking view. Exit Glacier was spectacular! But this glacier brings the sad part as well. The park has placed signs containing a year. The year denotes the point at which the glacier existed, we some some years in the 1800s. But those signs were so far away from where the glacier ends now! Go see this park as soon as you can so can experience the glacier and its spectacular surroundings!","October 4, 2019",Nature at Work,2,,5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"My wife and I took the bay cruise recently while on vacation. Enjoyed it very much. Saw two glaciers up close plus sea lions, otters and seals.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"As we were driving through the park, we experienced beautiful scenes at every turn. The number of glaciers was amazing to we east coasters who see snow on the mountains only in the winter and no glaciers ever. The Aspen trees were turning yellow while we were there so we saw greens and yellows together in varying hues. The mountains also provided a palate of colors above the tree line which we don't see on the east coast mountains. A really spectacular park. We will be back!","September 17, 2019",Unparalleled scenery,0,,5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"This is a beautiful park to explore. You have options of back country hikes, more accessible hikes such as Exit Glacier, or can explore from the water on a tour or kayak. The landscape and wildlife is exceptional. I saw orcas, otters, seals, jellies, and tons of birds including bald eagles and puffins. The beautiful drive from Anchorage to Seward is also with the trip.","September 17, 2019",Vast with many options,104,"San Diego, California",4
Kenai Fjords National Park,"We all talk and debate about global warming but this place kind of provides an in-your-face documentation of global warming; so real, right in front of our eyes. We visited the park on a hazy afternoon in August and participated in the Ranger led hike to the Exit Glacier view point that starts at 1pm everyday. Along the way the ranger explained a lot about the vegetation and showed us the well documented timeline of retreat. The park has been able to document the195 years of accelerating pullback of the Exit Glacier really well. It was a real eye opener! The Exit Glacier Nature Center from where the hike starts also has a lot of exhibits demonstrating several facts about the glaciers. I would highly recommend this place. Parking is available but it is limited and gets full. So it might take some time to find a spot.","September 16, 2019",Such an eye opening experience!,80,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We visited the park on a boat ride to see animals and glaciers - we were just amazed! We booked a trip with Major Marine because there is a park ranger from the NP on each boat, but the boat broke down so they cancelled our trip and we had to take a trip with Kenai Fjord Tours - there was no ranger on board. So while the tour was good, I didnt' feel like we really got the same experience. Our Capt was nice - actually Captain Jaime was hilarious (like playing Titanic music when we started seeing iceburgs).We saw seals, sealions, puffins, and even a pod of orca. It was amazing!Lunch was a sandwich and that was good. OTher food for purchase.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We went on the Northwestern Glacier cruise with Kenai Fjords Tours, on the Alaskan Explorer with Captain Chris Overbeck. Captain Overbeck and the Alaskan Explorer crew (Jennifer, Sam and Gail) were fabulous! Captain did a great job finding the sea birds and wildlife and manuvered the boat to get some great pictures without chasing or threatening the wildlife in any way.The way he handled the boat though the glacier ice and around the rock islands and how close he could get to the rock walls was amazing to me.I have lived in Alaska for 50 years and I have to say this is one of the best experiences I have had. I would, and have recamended this to anyone. It was well worth the money and a first class operation.Oh and the smell of fresh baked chocolate cookies on the way back into Resurection Bay and being served fresh cookies topped off a great day.","August 19, 2019","A wonderful day, amazing wildlife and scenery",24,"Fairbanks, Alaska",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"The Kenai Fjords National Park consists of the marine portion which is accessible by cruise boat operators. These are the catamaran day cruise boats which are very navigable and able to come up close to the glaciers, as well as search for wildlife to view at a safe distance. Most of the activity in the Park centers around Aialik Bay which has the massive Holgate Glacier. This part of the Park is part of the half-day maritime tours out of Seward. The full day tour would include visiting Harris Bay and the Northwestern Fjord.Kenai National Park also includes the Exit Glacier Nature Center which is accessible by land from Seward. I did not visit that portion of the park.The impact of a warmer climate trend is on full display in these glaciers. There is no doubt that these glaciers are slowly retreating due to more melting.The Visitor's Center is on the harbor in Seward and should be visited before or after a tour to complete a full understanding of this National Park.","August 19, 2019",One of the Truly Spectacular National Parks to Visit to Fjords and Glaciers,44,"Goleta, California",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"My husband and I went to the Exit Glacier Viewpoint as well as to the summit viewpoint of Harding Icefield past the shelter. Along the trail to the summit there were wildflower meadows, snowfields, marmots, and a mountain goat. The wildflowers included fireweed, gentians, monkshood, yellow paintbrush, and campanula. The glacier and nanatucks were gorgeous to behold as the clouds lifted to reveal their full view. A little smoke entered to area later after the clouds burnt off. We also enjoyed the 7 1/2 hour cruise complete with lunch to see calving glaciers, whales (Fin and Orca), sea otters, puffins, sea lions, jellyfish, and eagles. We had a wonderful time at each.","August 1, 2019","Exit Glacier, Harding Icefield, tour via cruise",59,"Woodburn, Oregon",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,Appreciate all national parks. It’s worth the short 2.50 mile round rip hike up to see Exit Glacier. The hike is easy but not wheelchair accessible. It does have a bit of an incline the higher you go and gets rocky. Beautiful and incredible history as markers show the location change in the Glacier by year. One area of trail was closed due to a sighting of a Sow with three cubs in that area with plenty of warnings and precautionary instructions given. ,"July 31, 2019",Worth seeing Exit Glacier,1,"Richmond, Virginia",5

Unfortunately we were unable to hike to Exit Glacier due to bear activity on the trail. There are signs along the road to the park entrance marking how far the glacier extended.

The staff at the park office are very friendly and helpful also. You have the option to go out to the glacier on a guided tour with a ranger. But if you miss those times, no worries, you can walk out to the glacier yourself on a very well groomed path.

We took a nine hour boat tour with Kenai Fjords Tours, and I loved every minute of it. The vistas in the National Park are out of this world.

We kept moving for the most part, except where we were stopped to view wildlife (puffins, seals, sea lions, humpback whales - and babies, sea otters, eagles, cormorants, murres, black bears, etc.). Also, a terrific time viewing the glaciers, with very active calving.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"When we boarded the boat for our trip to Northwestern glacier everyone was asked what we were hoping to see and our guides then gave a percentage assessment of our chances. We only really hoped to see puffins so our expectations were quite low - wow were we in for a surprise!On the way out we saw beautiful rock formations, sea otters, harbour seals, sea lions, a porpoise, our puffins, and many other birds, along with 2 humpback whales that the crew made sure we got a good look at. The glacier itself was stunning and we were told not to expect much calving as it wasn’t normally very active. It was when we were there. We heard cracking and then saw ice falling off the top of the glacier onto a shelf of ice further down, it did this a few times before the shelf became too full and turned into an ice fall.The way back was initially much quieter when suddenly the crew spotted a pod of orcas, we stayed for the maximum time before moving off to give other boats a chance and sailed straight into a second pod of orcas, again we watched for a while and then moved off into a third pod of orcas!!!! Incredible!The crew were great, the day was fabulous!","July 8, 2019",Fabulous day!,387,UK,5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"This is another stunningly beautiful part of Alaska. Seeing the fjords and glaciers and the sea life in the area is an amazing experience. With the climate catastrophe going on, we were especially glad we got to see glaciers. They really are as amazing as the photos we're used to seeing. We took one of the boat tours (Major, one of the companies that works with the Park Service). It was expensive but well worth money to see the glaciers and whales, orca, dolphin, sea otters, puffins, etc. It's too bad that it's so expensive to explore most of the park. Fortunately, there's no cost to visit Exit Glacier, and the best look we got at a sea otter was in the harbor.","July 5, 2019",Unbelievably Beautiful,8,"Ashland, Oregon",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We hiked at Exit Glacier and took a boat tour of the park with Kenai Fjords Tours. The Exit Glacier hike is so beautiful and not too difficult. There are several options of trails and it’s amazing (and sad) to see how much the glacier has receded. Be aware there are no restrooms once you’re on the trails so be sure to go at the visitors center. The boat tour allows you to see parts of the park inaccessible by land. The scenery is so stunning and you get to see lots of wildlife (whales, sea lions, seals, seabirds).

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We visited with our teenage kids and enjoyed very much. We did the Exit Glacier hike to Marmot Meadows and the views were amazing. It was a tough hike though. My husband and son continued on past the meadows and the trail got even more difficult. They are both experienced hikers and it was tough, but worth it for the view. They saw a bear and 2 cubs. The hikes arround the visitor center are easy and offer gorgeous views as well. We also did a glacier tour with Major Marine Tours, which us also a must do.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Kenai Fjords National Park is huge, and unless you have a lot of time, you will likely see only bits of the edges. It is still just incredible!The Harding Ice Field is perhaps the major feature of the park, as it feeds the 40-something glaciers. We visited Exit Glacier by car, and the Holgate and Aialik Glaciers by boat. The glaciers were amazing. During our boat trip, we also saw humpback whales, orca, sea lions, harbor seals, sea otters, puffins, bald eagles and more.I highly recommend a visit to Kenai Fjords National Park, even just the bits around the edges!","July 3, 2019",Just an Incredible Park,128,Florida,5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"Interesting national park. We took the ranger led easy hike, starting at the Nature Center, to Exit Glacier. The ranger was very friendly and knowledgeable. He walked at a leisurely pace and stopped often to inform us about things we saw and about the glacier. Very worthwhile glacier to hike to, even if you do it on your own. We also took the Kenai Fjords National Park boat tour the next day. The boat tour was really scenic and we saw amazing calving glaciers. We would definitely recommend taking the boat tour. Reservations are not needed for the glacier walk but would definitely be recommended for the boat tour.","July 1, 2019",Informative ranger led walk to Exit Glacier - Fantastic boat tour,4,"Wylie, Texas",5

The boat operator, Major Marine Tours, gave us excellent commentary including a park ranger on board, and they left us with a high quality souvenir book. Whilst the sea in the fjords was generally calm, we did spend around 45 minutes in total on the open ocean, and for those not used to it, the swell on the Gulf of Alaska was considerable on the day we sailed. Fortunately the crew offered sea-sickness preventatives and were very helpful to those who felt uncomfortable.","June 29, 2019","Great wildlife viewings, but be ready for some rough seas",13,"Alton, United Kingdom",4

Kenai Fjords National Park,"I was on a photography tour with Backcountry Journeys and we spent four days cruising the Kenai Fjords looking for wildlife photography opportunities. We saw Orcas, Humpback Whales, Sea Otters, Puffins, Common Merrs, Comorants, Bald Eagles, Seals, Sea Lions, and many more species. The Sea Otters were my favorites. They swim on their backs, holding their paws and head out of the cold water. They spin around in the water to accumulate air bubbles in their fur for insulation since they don't have blubber. We also sailed to see two of the larger glaciers, which were impressive in their size, noise, color and texture. The fjords are surrounded by steep slopes leading to snow covered peaks. If you were observant you could spot mountain goats high on the steep slopes.Most of the park is only accessible by boat but there are many cruise options available. I wasn't there to fish, but fishing is a big attraction.","June 15, 2019",Alaskan wildlife in the wild,26,,5

You can also see how the glacier is sadly retreating & has been for over a century.It is a popular destination, so go early if you want to avoid crowds or have the possibility of seeing wildlife (we saw none).","June 15, 2019","Wow, Spectacular!!",3,"Lawrence, Kansas",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Let's be honest - this is not the US's most accessible national park, but then again you didn't come to Alaska for easy accessibility! This park is primarily water and ice, so the traditional mode of just driving around or taking buses doesn't work here. There are barely even hiking trails. If you want to see the park in all its stunning glory, you've gotta get on the water. Thankfully, there's lots of ways to do that, from renting kayaks to organized boat tours to fishing. Just don't plan on swimming. You can take small planes around, but that's crazy expensive. There are 2 hikes at Exit Glacier, and the ice field hike is amazing even if snow prohibits you going all the way up. Don't backcountry hike here unless you know what you're doing - not because of wildlife (though there's plenty) but because it's easy to get lost. An expensive park, but there are no others like it!","June 2, 2019",Takes some planning but well worth it,6,"Terre Haute, Indiana",5

We left Alaska from Seward and passed through Resurrection bay with Kenai Fjords National Park on the right side of the ship. It is billed as the area where mountains and ice meet the ocean and this is an accurate description of the Park. From the water we saw an unspoiled rocky landscape, snow topped mountains, deep inlets, and a score of little rocky islands and outcroppings. Breathtaking landscape to say the least. We saw lots of wildlife especially sea birds.

We are relatively strong hikers, and while very do-able, did not find the hike easy - terrain is rough/rocky, and the climbing is pretty relentless. We also added a mile or so on exploring all the viewpoints on the climb and at the top, where you are looking across an ice field larger than the state of Rhode Island. It's mind-blowing!

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We were with a group, and this was the only day that we could take the tour. This experience was absolutely nothing like the photos which depict a calm sea with lots of wildlife. Before we boarded, they warned us that we were on the end of a typhoon from down south, and that it would be a bit rough around the cape, and that we would take a vote as we set out - if it was too rough and people felt ill, they would forgo the glacier trip and just look for wildlife instead and offer a partial refund and come back early. All of us in our party were premedicated with Bonine just in case. As we set out, the seas were worse, and next thing you know, 1/3 of the boat is vomiting and no vote was taken. We forged ahead and boated to the glacier and then into several more bays to see wildlife. Other tours we talked with later were shocked that the Kenai Fjords tour had not been cancelled and that they took passengers out in that weather. The crew was kind with saltines and ginger ale, but I have never been out in waves that rough for 6 hours. I will not go again and really can't recommend this to anyone unless you have the stomach of a seaman. Several crewmembers said the roughness around the cape was typical regardless of the weather. We did see one humpback whale breach which was amazing, and the glacier was gorgeous. Of course when we pulled back into the bay, there were three otters having a great time.

Some of the tours are only 3 1/2 hours up to eight so you have the choice of one that is right for you. Just touring Resurrection Bay was beautiful. I would recommend a cruise that has an naturalist/park ranger on board to give you information about the history of the area, wildlife, glaciers and the park. We were late in the season but still saw a pod of orcas, raft of sea otters, circus of puffins, sea lions, a mountain goat and more. Even without the wildlife the beauty of the area was tremendous.

Kenai Fjords National Park,This was an accidental side trip. The road leading to Exit Glacier Nature Center is a short distance (careful short distance in Alaska can mean miles away but this was about 3 miles from the city center) from the city center. It was worth every minute. The hike from the parking lot to final viewing area was considered easy to moderate. I suppose if it was raining it would be slippery in spots and thus moderate but all in all it’s easy. There are placards along the way that show how much this Glacier has receded since the early 1800’s. It certainly makes you take notice of the climate change over the last 150 years. If you have the time make the trip. There is an 8.4 mile hike that climbs 3500 feet. We didn’t have the time and my wife couldn’t handle that. But it is certainly a challenge.,"August 17, 2018",Exit Glacier ,23,"Dittmer, Missouri",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"I'm a self proclaimed national park geek so national parks are always on our must see list. If you're in Seward, make time to see both the land and sea of Kenai Fjords. The first day we drove out to Exit Glacier and hiked the Harding Icefields trail to Marmot Meadows. The clouds looked very threatening and we weren't in the mood to hike in rain. The trail up to Marmot Meadows was beautiful. Coming off a visit to Denali, it felt down right lush and tropical with all the different trees, plants and flowers. At Marmot Meadows there are good views of Exit Glacier and you a little bit of the Harding Icefield. After we came back down from Marmot Meadows we took the trails to the glacier overlook so we could the front of the glacier. All in all a wonderful half day. Right as we got in the car it started raining and we were happy not to be caught in it.The next day we took a cruise with Kenai Fjords Cruise Tours to experience the park from the sea. It was very moody (rain, clouds, and gray) but that just made it seem more mysterious! It was great to get a second perspective on the park and the resources and animals it protects.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Kenai Fjord NP was the purpose of our visit to Seward. We were blessed with great sunny weather as we made the most of our three days in Seward. We went out through Resurrection Bay on a long trip by small boat (~30) to Northwestern glacier. See my review for Major Marine tours. The scenery was spectacular and primordial. I could imagine the first Europeans seeing much the same sights .... only even more spectacular as the glaciers were so much larger 2-500 years ago. The park visitor centers, rangers and our guides did a great job helping us understand the magnitude of environmental change through the ages (even before human encroachment, nature was remodeling the area on its own). The earliest photos brought the impact home. What is now accessible was unachievable 200+ years ago.The National Park rangers near the Seward harbor and at Exit Glacier were uniformly informative.The best way to experience the Kenai is by boat.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Living in Alaska for almost 40 years, I can't recommend a tour of Kenai Fjords NP highly enough. It is a place I take visiting friends and relatives. I want them to see it, and I certainly like to see it often. Depending on your time schedule, some possibilities may be too long for you to include. I do recommend a couple of days in the Seward area. One day alone for a 6 or 7 hour boat tour using any of he companies. Each day seems to have different wildlife and different aspects of what to see. In summer lots of sea birds, dolphins, seals, otters, and a variety of whales are common. Possibly most importantly, though, is seeing a glacier up close. The magnitude of either Hubbard or Aialik Glacier is difficult to comprehend. Also, the size is difficult to show in a picture. Travel to Aialik Bay using any of the tour companies in Seward. They're all good companies and take their work and customer satisfaction seriously. The ocean near Seward is not predictable and the reason that glaciers exist there is due to consistently wet weather. Be prepared, and know that even on drizzly days, the sea life is out there to be seen. If you're prone to motion sickness, take precautions before leaving harbor. Seriously, though, you need to keep eating and drinking while on the boat. Don't wait for two hours to put something in your belly! If you don't have a full day to spend on a boat, there are shorter tours, but instead consider going to Exit Glacier. It's a short and beautiful drive from Seward. Take the easy hike towards the face of the glacier. Even if you can't go all the way, getting closer to the face helps you to understand more about glaciers and glaciology. Pay attention to where the face of the glacier was at differing times in history. Some recent history. Yes, the glacier has receded due to global warming and climate change that dramatically in that short a time. If you can get close to hear it moving, to feel the cool wind coming from the ice, and to witness the small changes in the environment in the area, you'll understand more about our world.

It's just a long day on a boat to get there.The next day we did a quick hike to see Exit Glacier-- an easy to moderate hike 1+ mile depending on your conditioning. I would have like to do the longer hike to the top of the Harding Icefield but it's an all day, more rigorous trail.I think the weather dictates how much you enjoy this-- we did not have good conditions.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We started out doing the Ranger Guided hike to Marmot Meadows. The Ranger had some really great information to share about the park and hiked at a reasonable pace for the group of folks on the tour. A word of caution, once you leave the flat, paved walkway it's all uphill to Marmot Meadows. The trail is in excellent shape and easy to follow without a Ranger. It is a moderately strenuous hike.The Ranger's Guided Hike ended at Marmot Meadows. He offered advice for continuing on to Top of the Cliffs Overlook which my son and I decided to tackle. It was another 1,000 feet of vertical ascent to get there and much of it was through snow. However, the trail was well-marked and we made it to the overlook after another moderately strenuous hike. The views overlooking Exit Glacier from there are stunning and well worth the effort to get there! If the trail beyond Top of the Cliffs wasn't closed due to avalanche danger, we probably would have kept hiking to try and see if we could get a peek at the Harding Ice Field. Since the return was all downhill, it was a very easy descent.","June 24, 2018",Exit Glacier is amazing!,1,"Columbia, Maryland",5

Also, some outside companies are licensed to take tours out onto Exit Glacier and in the park in general. We took advantage of this and it was such a great experience! Id highly recommend it. If you want to see more of the actual fjords, bays, and glaciers, you have to take boat tours out there out of Seward, as they are only accessible by water. These tours are very long, most around 7-9 hours. We weren’t able to do one but they looked cool and I wish we could have!

At the visitors center they have Ranger lead guided hikes, however we decided to do this on our own. There is a well Marked Trail to follow that takes you to a viewing of the Exit glacier. It was raining heavy the day we went, so a bridge that led to the glacier was closed due to flooding. Be warned, it rains a lot here, so bring rain gear. There is also a more demanding trail that takes you close to the Harding icefield. To go all the way would require 4 to 5 hours. Hiking sticks would be most helpful. We only went up partway, as the trail became steep and slippery. Since it is the same way back, you should know your ability and gauge how far you should go and turn back.

The glacier is free, and the boat tour is definitely not, but it is worth every penny. We happened to go on a day with perfect weather (mid-60s and no rain. Barely even a cloud), which probably made a big difference, and were able to see a dozen whales, a massive glacier calving, puffins, sea otters, sea lions, dall porpoises and more. If you’re on the fence about spending the money, go ahead and commit. Our boat had probably 20% of the seats still open when we departed, and it looks like there are 3-4 companies right there in Seward harbor you can travel with.

There is one location in the park you can drive to and get out of your car. That is Exit Glacier. The walk is fairly easy to make in order to get a good viewing position. A longer hike is possible that will take you up to the glacier. Much of what you do at this park is based on the time of the year and the weather conditions. The small park cruise vessels had not started when we were there in early May. The Exit Glacier road had just opened, but hiking to the glacier edge was only with proper equipment(snowshoes.)

Most facilities were still closed in early May, although the bathrooms were open. It's an easy hike on a well marked trail to view Exit glacier. It's a rocky, slightly longer hike along the river to reach the terminus of the glacier, but well worth the effort.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"These are the three ingredients that make Kenai Fjords National Park wonderful and you are guaranteed to see plenty of each in any exploration of the park which is typically composed of two popular activities.One common activity in the park is exploring the Exit Glacier area which is the only portion accessible by car and located about 12 miles (19k) northwest of Seward. In the Exit Glacier area, one can hike relatively short, easy trails that takes one to the outwash plain Exit Glacier and to an overlook at the glacier’s edge although there is some elevation gain to get to the overlook. If you have more stamina and time, one can hike longer trails to the Harding Ice Field. It is not uncommon to see a bear or moose in this area.The other common activity, and the one I would recommend if you only have time for one, is to take a guided boat tour. There are several companies providing boat tours, we used Major Marine, that depart frequently from the harbor in Seward to cruise Resurrection Bay and, depending upon the tour, by different parts of the National Park. All but the shortest tour includes a Park Ranger on board providing interpretation and help in spotting wildlife which will almost certainly include sea otters, bald eagles, puffins, other seabirds, Steller sea lions, harbor seals and with very good chances of see whales as well.

So big, so blue. We enjoyed watching a couple little seals peacefully floating on one of the icebergs at the base of the glacier. The ship's captain was quite savvy in locating whales, which he said were easily found by swarmings of gulls and puffins so were able to witness a lot of blow hole spouts and a few whale tails.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"In Anchorage in visitor center and hostel everybody talks about visiting Seward. As I was keen on ice caves I researched online and contacted tour agencies in different places, just some different options I put all together here. Ice caves, no guarantees, after summer many are filled with water, can be very dangerous not recommend by some tours. Mendenhall maybe, if you wanna spend a 200 something to fly there to check it out. Valdez, ice caves kayaking no guarantee, a YouTube video says it collapsed.Between Ancharage and Seward there is a Portage glacier (quite awesome from pic) the cruise is only 39. In Valdez the kayaking among icebergs 145? In Spencer Glacier tour including return train from Ancharage, kayaking, hiking on glaciers is 379? (Don't remember exact price). If you check on their map in Kenai Fjords Tours the glaciers they take you on the boat is quite far away, hence the long hours and 159 price I guess, which I personally feel unnecessary. And I heard from people been on the tour, the water was rough, several people throw up, and got soaked. Since its been cold (Sept), windy, and raining for the past several days, I didn't want to go on this tour, especially after the glaciers in Patagonia. I did jump on a kayaking among icebergs after stacking in hostel for 2 days, but there was some iceberg broke into thousds of pieces floating down the river, the boat couldn't go through the river to reach the lagoon to kayak and we were offered reschedule or refund. And it's a quite expense 299 compare to Valdez.So depends on what you want to do, Seward may not be the best consider other places on your way or where you will be going. And some tours are stopping around mid Sept, and I was told killer whales had migrated, and I'm sure you can see humpback whales in California or Mexico or many places around the world.","September 9, 2017",Different Options,172,"Mount Shasta, California",3

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Just finished our Princess cruise and spent four days pre-cruise in Anchorage so we could take an excursion to the Kenai Fjords National Park. This was a wonderful trip aboard a Kenai Fjords Tours boat from Seward. The excursion was a bus ride with Anchorage Parks from the Eagan Center which was a few blocks from The Hotel Captain Cook. The bus ride was beautiful even though it was foggy and raining and cold. (Kenai Fjords Tours has some great priced jackets if you forgot a warm coat.)The scenery is beautiful. The glacier was amazing. The first tidal glacier we have seen. We saw killer whales, sea otters, and a fascinating school of jelly fish on the surface.Thank you National Park Service for preserving another wonderful piece of the earth for me and in years to come my grandchildren to see and cherish.","September 5, 2017",Excellent pre-cruise excursion,178,"Galesburg, Illinois",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We had upgraded our Holland America cruise on the Noordam to include a 10-hour daytrip that included a 6-hour cruise with lunch aboard a 95-foot Kenai Fjords Tours ship. The adult fare was $179.95 each.The cruise out of Resurrection Bay went well. About an hour out of port, we got about two miles into Kenai Fjords National Park and were motoring up the first fjord. We were getting a distant glance at two glaciers. From what we could see, they looked spectacular.Then, disaster struck. One of the twin engines caught fire. The ship limped back to port. The rest of our excursion was canceled. We had just enough time to dash to the Kenai Fjords National Park Visitor Center about four buildings away from Kenai Fjords Tours building. I was able to get a park brochure, talk to a ranger about the park, get my national parks passport stamped, and buy souvenirs ~ a few postcards and sew-on patch. For those who participate in the Passport to Your National Parks Program, the cancellation station is at the visitor center with a small gift shop/bookstore. There are three cancellation stamps. Two are for the park. The other is bonus for the nearby Turnagain Arm National Heritage Area. They read:● Kenai Fjords National Park - Seward, AK● Kenai Fjords NP – NPS Centennial● Kenai Mountains -Turnagain Arm NHA - Seward, AK That 30 minutes gave me a chance to salvage a scrapped trip and turn it into something productive. We also had just enough time to scurry across the street to Subway to get sandwiches to eat on the nearly 3-hour long motor coach ride from Seward to Anchorage.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Wow how Exit Glacier has receded over the years. My first visit was nearly 26 years ago and the glacier was bigger and closer. The National Park road drive to the visitor center has signs with the year of the glacier's previous location. Once you park, there is an easy (approximate 1 mile loop) to the ""edge of the glacier"" spot where you can get great photos. There are longer trails to explore.The route is paved, gravel and solid rock the whole way. It can be quite wet at times. I'd recommend hiking shoes or something you dint mind getting a little wet. Exit Glacier is ""exiting"" or receding approximately 125-200' a year. I have heard there is no additional plan to expand the trail if the glacier continues to recede out of sight.This is a must-do FREE hike.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"This park is 100 percent work a visit when you are in Alaska. Staying in Seward puts you in a perfect position for all the action. Take a boat tour into the Fjords, its the only way to really see the park. Then do a Kayak tour - being so near the water is pretty amazing. You will not freeze I promise!The wildlife here is SO ACTIVE it's actually insane. I think because a lot of humans haven't really touched the land in the park so all the animals are constantly out and about. I can pretty much guarantee that you WILL see some wildlife while on a boat or kayak tour in the Fjords. Go to a tour that goes deep into the glaciers, that is an experience you will never forget.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"If you're like us, we were wondering if we'd really enjoy the park after visiting Denali and already having done a cruise out of Whittier. Kenai Fjords NP was a highlight. Here are a couple standouts:""A top-ten life experience"" – my wifeWe did the Bear Glacier Kayak tour with Liquid Adventures and it was amazing! They had a custom flat-bottom jet boat built to enable them to access an iceberg-filled lagoon that's only accessible by helicopter or by this special boat that can shoot up a narrow and shallow river. We were literally the only people in this lagoon that was filled with floating icebergs all around us. I'm just guessing but I think it was probably a 4-5 miles across and long, to give you an idea of how secluded it felt. We did the half day tour, which was plenty. If you do the full-day tour, you'll be able to paddle all the way in to where the glacier meets the water. If you've read about it, you'll see that people note how bumpy the ride there is due to having to go through Resurrection Bay in this flat bottom boat. It's true, but don't let that deter you. It was fun and well worth it.NP Tour by boat:We wondered if this would be repetitive having done the kayaking the day before and having done the 26 Glacier Tour out of Whittier (which I highly recommend). It wasn't! It was fantastic. I'd say it was 70% about seeing animals and 30% glaciers, which was a nice flip from the Whittier tour. We went with Kenai Fjords Tours because their cruise time worked best with our schedule. They were fantastic. The captain, Brian, and crew were all terrific and boat was very nice. Prior to booking it, I called them to ask specific questions about seeing sea stacks and they recommend noting that on your reservation and then telling the captain when you get on board. She said the captains are always happy to try to accommodate request. I found that to be exceptional service. Some of the local guides on other tours recommended Major Marine tours because they were more local and thought to have better food. But, we were very happy with Kenai Fjords Tours. For photography buffs:Bring a long lens. If you don't have one, rent or borrow one. I had my brother's 150-600mm and I used every bit of the zoom to get shots of animals. You'll be so glad you did it when you see your photos. We saw tons of animals: orcas, humpbacks, puffin, eagles, seals, otters, sea lions, a bazillion birds.

Anyone with major physical issues (like using a wheelchair/walker or have difficulty walking) I would not recommend since there a parts that are a bit steep. My husband and I were fortunate to take a Ranger-led tour. He was a retired classroom teacher who over the last 18 years has taken students to visit the glacier. He showed us where and told us how much the glacier had receded. It was heart wrenching to see how much the climate is impacting the glacier. When asked for a possible solution, the Ranger said only data was being collected. It was interesting to visit. Personally, a solution will have to involve everyone.","August 7, 2017",Exit Glacier trail accessible and get more 411 by taking Guided Tour from Ranger,183,"La Verne, California",4
Kenai Fjords National Park,"While we did not see all of the park, driving through was incredible! But going to see the Aialik Glacier from the water was nothing short of amazing. I was in awe of the color of the glacier and how peaceful it is there. The glacier is melting, so chunks of ice were falling into the water almost every 10-15 minutes. To see the calving is both amazing, and slightly depressing. Highly recommend a trip to see the glaciers in this incredible National Park.","August 7, 2017",Incredible!,19,"Maui, Hawaii",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"I've never been on a public boat tour that specializes in scenery, animals and marine life until I went on this day trip. Was on the Orca Voyager and I believe Brian was the Captain. This trip was great. I didn't spend a lot of time inside as I wanted to be outside to enjoy the sea air and to use my camera. I saw a lot of wildlife, seascapes and landscapes from the boat, along with a few glaciers, one up close. I also learned a ton about the area and about various sea life or animal life, along with some other bits of information about the glacier. Having learned all of this stuff as I was witnessing it made me truly appreciate what this company is doing along with a better appreciation for Seward and the national park.Our cruise ended with a dinner on Fox Island.

It turned out very ok because we took our time and hiked all over the well-marked trails on our own. We had the best time going up high towards Exit Glacier! You could easily pack a lunch and take a picnic break in many places with amazing views. The winds were strong and cold to me so I would take my jacket and hat off and on during the entire hike. I had read and was prepared for that. Gorgeous views and all FREE! We had children ages 11-18 but we saw young and old making the hike - just go at your own pace and have an experience of a lifetime!!!","July 30, 2017",Wonderful experience!,29,"Toronto, Canada",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"The actual day boat ride was long, cold, and boring. We had never been to Alaska, never seen whales or glaciers. We actually did see whales, but at the time I really didn't think it was so exciting. We saw a couple of whale tails waving at us, and some other birds. The prime rib and Alaska King Crab which is half of the reason we bought this tour was really bad. The Crabs were cold, with some ice still on the inside and the prime rib was tasteless. In fact the Alaska King Crab legs we buy at Costco's was better and the prime rib all you can eat at Golden Corral was better.The only good thing was that they did give me some pills for seasickness. That could be coloring my whole experience. ","July 29, 2017",FOOD WAS HORRIBLE,0,,1
Kenai Fjords National Park,"I visited the Kenai Fjords both by land and by sea. First, I took a boat trip on the Stellar Sunrise, a smaller boat (17 people total) and we were able to customize the trip to look for birds as part of a birding field trip organized by Texas Ornithological Society. The crew knew just where to find Tufted and Horned Puffin; Ancient, Kittlitz's and Marbled Murrelets; Red-faced Cormorants and other beautiful birds found nesting only in places like these northern cliffs of the fjords. We also saw Sea Otters, Stellar Seals and Whales blowing and feeding off of krill. The scenery was so beautiful and the weather was very cooperative with sunshine and calm seas. It was an unforgettable day out on Aialik Fjord, with views from the water of Peterson, Alaik and Bear Glacers. Just stunning!Another day, we saw the park by land, driving a short distance north of Seward to Exit Glacier and taking a ranger led hike (2.4 miles round trip-FREE) out to the glacier. Beautiful, easy walk with explanation stops along the lower portion. Our Park Ranger was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. Yellow, purple and white wildflowers flourished all along the way. The trail was little strenuous as you near the glacier and have some altitude to gain to get to the glacier overlook. So worth it! The views were amazing! There is a trail that actually continues from the overlook to get you very near the ice. So COOL (literally and figuratively!!)

But the star of the park is the wildlife. On a day-long cruise, we saw humpbacks (over a dozen in multiple encounters), orcas, and fin whales. And if you're a bird lover, bring your camera and binoculars—they're everywhere.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We saw Kenai Fjords National Park from two vantage points: the first was on a boat tour to Northwestern Glacier - spectacular beauty and incredible wildlife that never stopped on our all-day tour! - I wrote extensively about this in another Trip Advisor review on Kenai Fjords Tours. Suffice it to say that the boat tour was magnificent! Our second vantage point of this National Park was on Exit Glacier, the only part of the Park accessible by car. The access road is a few miles north of the town of Seward. There is a visitor center/nature center at Exit Glacier - small but informative. There are a couple of trailheads that begin behind the visitor/nature center: the Harding Ice Field Trail - strenuous - and the Exit Glacier trail - easy to moderate. We took the trail to Exit Glacier. Signs along the trail (and signs along the access road to the visitor center) were marked with the years when the Glacier covered that particular area - global warming has had quite an impact on this and all the glaciers in this National Park. You can get pretty close to the glacier itself on this trail. On our return, we left the loop trail and took the outwash trail back to the little pavilion near the visitor center so we could catch the ranger talk on geology of the area. It was an excellent talk plus we got to actually touch the various kinds of stones and minerals that make up the geology of the area. If you visit Seward, you've got to take a boat tour to see the incredible fjords and massive glaciers - and the spectacular wildlife in this National Park! And at the very least, check out the road-accessible and hike-able Exit Glacier.","July 2, 2017",Spectacular National Park!,224,"Bennington, Vermont",5

The most moving part of the experience was seeing the signs marking the years the glacier extended to different areas; a great visual to see the rapid melting of the glacier reflective of climate change.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Kenai Fjords National Park is simply amazing and a must-see if you are in the area. While staying in Seward, we did two hikes at this park. Both hikes started at the visitor center, which is about 15 minutes from Seward.The first hike we did was a short, 30 minute walk to Exit Glacier. This trail was well-paved and marked, and had very little elevation gain. The trail takes you through the forest, with several lookout points to the river, glacier, and nearby mountains. There are markers all along the trail that point out where the glacier has been throughout history. Once through the forest, a magnificent vista of the massive Exit Glacier and surrounding mountains opens up. Depending on the trail markers at the time, you can get pretty close to the glacier. You will see the blue ice and many cracks and crevasses. It was quite an amazing sight! We spent about 45 minutes exploring and taking pictures before completing the 30 minute walk back. This is an easy trail that could be done with families and most ability levels.The second hike that we did was to the Harding Icefield and it was TOUGH! The hike is about 8 miles long, round trip, and has a steep elevation gain throughout. The trail takes you through the forest and up and above the tree line. Here, there are stunning views of the glacier below and the mountains. Then, you continue up to Marmot Meadows (we saw quite a few marmots!) and the cliffs that overlook the glacier. The views here are stunning and well worth the hard work. From there, the trail continues up the mountain and becomes completely snow covered (late June), although the temperatures were pretty warm when we were here. This was the most amazing part of the hike, as you feel like you are in a different world. Finally, we made it to the top with absolutely incredible views of the Harding Icefield- 700 square miles of ice and snow stretching before you with mountains dotting the horizon. I have never seen such an incredible sight! It was awe-inspiring and so beautiful. If you are able, I can't recommend this hike enough. But be prepared- it is a moderate to difficult trail and a long trip, so pack snacks, layers, sunscreen, warm clothes and any other gear you may need for the weather. We did not see any bears, but bears are frequently sighted on this trail.

How else would you get so close to a glacier and to hear and see the 'calving' - when part of the ice cracks and falls into the water was an additioal bonus.Obviously seeing various wildlife depends on the time of day and year but the organisers have experience of where the best areas are for viewing whales, birds, sea lions etc etc. We took the tour which included the meal on Fox Island - sufficient but catering for so many is not easy.","June 29, 2017",Wow!!what an Experience,31,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",4

We so appreciated the time spent making sure we got a chance to see the whales, dolphins, calving glaciers, sea lions, puffins.And then we stopped at fox island for dinner, what a lovely day this was. If you are considering a day on the open sea, this was a great choice. We were served lunch, had access to food/beverages all day and were allowed to complete the junior ranger badge.

We saw five humpback whales - one breaching, and one fit whale, Dall's porpoises, innumerable tufted and horned puffins, Auklets, cormorants, harbor seals, sea lions, and my favorite sea otters. We watch a waterfall of snow and ice break off the glacier into the sea at the Northwest glacier. We had a beautiful day - the staff were so knowlegeble and the bird watchers aboard added to to their commentary. Worth the time and money.","June 28, 2017",I have never seen so many creatures in one day!,24,"Spokane Valley, Washington",5

There are various placards along the way showing where the glacier toe was over the years. It is upsetting to see how far the glacier had receded in recent years.Once in Seward we went out on a kayak trip with Miller's Landing and were able to paddle around in the mini icebergs and approach the toe of 3 glaciers in Northwestern Fjord. To see them from the water was an amazing experience and one not to miss. Our tour guide Chris and boat captain Chance were a wealth of knowledge about the area and animals.

He was so pleasant and enthusiastic and was wonderful with kids; you could tell he loved his job! Buffet was decent for being on a tour boat. All seats were reserved so it wasn't a dash from the dock to get a seat, which made boarding pleasant. Glaciers were beautiful; we spotted several whales, harbor seals, puffins, Steller sea lions, and bald eagles! A few folks got seasick but the staff was very helpful with that. Ranger Chad was extremely good at spotting wildlife and he knew it all. Wonderful trip especially if you have kids-they can even be a junior ranger on board.

The weather was great the day we visited, so the mountain ranges and the glaciers were visible. Sunny in the morning, rain in the afternoon. Expect some rain, that's common in Seward. So dress accordingly. But once you're out on the boat, you forget about the weather! We booked our tour with Kenai Fjords Tours and rode inside the main cabin when it got too cold or rainy to ride outside. We had plenty of room to walk around to different areas of the boat.

We started to do the longer hike but got a little spooked from a bear sighting the day before that was posted just before you entered the trail (there was also a teen killed up in anchorage the day before, so we were kind of cared of that also). We did a small hike off the side of the road on the way back to the main road. We only hiked a mile in and back (also still spooked to be in the woods because of bears). If I ever go back to Alaska again, I will be more prepared/bear spray or something, and definitely hike these trails. ","June 22, 2017","great park, well marked trails",38,"Mesa, AZ",5

One can see the glacier as one approaches the visitor's center. RVs park along the pullouts and several people live off the grid here in the national forest.The parking lot holds a lot of cars and RVs. The visitor's center as a small display of the glacier, clean restrooms, and one can see the markers when the glacier receded, with 1917 closest to the visitor's center, then 1924, 1950, 1961, etc. The trails amount to a nice 2.6 miles, on hilly terrain that is not suitable for strollers or wheelchairs due to steps and a few tree roots. I only walked as far as the upper trail; it was too wet to walk down to the actual glacier which one can legally do. The views are impressive. There were plenty of people on the trail despite the constant rain.I enjoyed a short ranger program on black and brown bears before leaving two hours later.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We stopped in Seward and gathered our lunch for a short hike and picnic to Exit Glacier. It was an easy drive in our rental car to the Glacier entrance. The hike itself is about 1 mile. The terrain is varied and starts out on a paved walkway then turns to dirt then gravel and ultimately gravel and rock closer to the Glacier. It is a gradual climb so no need to worry about elevation and steepness. You need to have sure footed shoes to climb over the rocks and gravel created by the glacier's receding moraine trail. As you get closer to the Glacier it also gets cooler so it's also a good idea to have an extra jacket, as always layers in Alaska. It is an easy hike but I would not recommend it to anyone with foot or knee problems since it does require you to be sure footed. The view at the Glacier is spectacular. When you leave there is another trail that is off the the right if you follow the ropes for a different return view which was very nice. Just keep follow the ropes even when it doesn't look like a path and you will follow the outwash plain.There is also an option on the way up to hike 6 miles to the top of the Glacier which is a quick elevation climb so requires preparations with water and proper clothing and equipment i.e. Hiking poles etc. It's a good idea to inquire as to the abundance of snow on the trail to be ready. When we were there early June someone said they turned around due to the amount of snow still on the trail to the top which gives a spectacular view of the ice fields.","June 12, 2017",Great View of Exit Glacier,29,,5

Kenai Fjords National Park,A wonderful easy drive (about 10 miles) from Seward (apparently they also run a shuttle if you don't have a car). The glacier is a beautiful sight and short walks are available with interesting signs. Part of what is most interesting are the signs which post years of the glacier edge over the last 100 plus years and to see how fast the acceleration of the retreat is occurring.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"I planned our entire cruise/land tour around being able to visit Kenai Fjords and it was absolutely worth it! We had perfect weather and saw just about every animal you could hope to see: breaching whales, porpoises, otters, cormorants, puffins, jellyfish, seals, starfish, sea lions... The fjords would have be beautiful without the wildlife and in any weather though: stunning and serene in sunlight, or mysterious in rain or fog. The glaciers are huge, their size impossible to truly appreciate, but the calving is especially impressive. It starts as a low and rolling distant thunder and then you hear the popping and creaking and suddenly a huge chunk of ice slowly crashes into the water. That is amazing; I could spend an entire day watching it. We also stopped at Fox Island. We didn't get to see much beyond the lodge, but it was beautiful. An NP ranger spoke during the dinner and completed the kids’ Jr. Ranger badges. There are restrooms and a small gift shop. We did have enough time to get our feet wet in the water (as long as we avoided the jellyfish). Our 8-yo had a great time on this trip and didn't complain of boredom even once.We took our tour through Kenai Fjords Tours, which I highly recommend.","May 26, 2017",Hours of Breathtaking Scenery and Wildlife,388,"Grand Rapids, MI",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"Just went on the National Park Tour boat trip with Kenai Fjords Tours yesterday and it was great! I have long lived in Alaska, but had never done anything like that and I'm so glad we did! First off, my husband and I were not sure if we would get seasick, but we took some medicine for it anyway about an hour before departure. Figure no harm in that as the only real side effect of the meds was drowsiness. One of the crew members shared tips about battling seasickness as we headed out, but also informed passengers that they did have medicine available for purchase if you didn't bring any. The water was a bit rough in places, but the captain gave warning and we didn't experience any sickness. As for the tour itself, I was pretty bummed out that it was a rainy day, however that didn't discourage the animals in any way and much of the landscape was still visible! What I really wanted to see was whales and that's just what we got! We saw orca whales and humpback whales, as well as eagles, stellar sea lions, and a black bear! We also visited some glaciers and another very beautiful site, geologically speaking, that had massive rocks with living trees on them seeming to protrude from the sea. The captain always gave enough time for pictures and sometimes even moved the boat around so that people on the side railings could get a good look. There was seating and tables inside the boat and I was very glad that my large backpack could fit under the chair! There was a decent cold lunch included with the trip as well as a fresh baked, warm cookie later that was much appreciated after looking at a chilly glacier. Other food and drinks were available for purchase, but many people brought their own snacks aboard. The crew was kind and friendly and the captain was great at sharing facts and history regarding the land and wildlife. He was also very skilled in his maneuvering to get us as close to wildlife as possible. My only real regret for this trip is that I forgot to bring a hat and gloves! Between it being rainy, the wind caused by the boat speeding along, and the general fact that you are in open water and near snowy mountains and glaciers, they become much needed! I was glad to have at least worn thermals and a fleece lined rain coat! All in all, I would definitely go on this trip again! It was a unique experience for my husband and me and we had great fun!","May 22, 2017",Awesome Trip,7,,5

On the water, we saw otters, seals, sea lions, puffins, bald eagles, humpback whales, and even two Orcas! On the hike, I saw two black bears up in a tree and the glacier was really neat to see up close. Definitely a park worth checking out! I went in May so a lot of the trail I was on was covered in snow. I wasn't able to go much more than a mile and a half as the trail was hard to find but the Edge of the Glacier hike is open and provided spectacular views.

The boat was very comfortable, with coffee, tea, lunch, snacks, beverages, cookies available all day long, though only lunch, drink during lunch and cookies in the afternoon were included in the price, the rest was extra. I recommend you have with you clothes to keep you warm as, even though our visit was in July, when at deck, it was extremely cold. But inside, it's quite warm and comfy.You can see all regional animals during the tour: whales, puffins, bald eagles, otters, sea lions, other sea birds. But, even if there were no animals, we would have the same appreciation as the overall landscape is awesome. Not only the glacier itself but all the rocks and small islands and the mist around them. It's really epic. Witnessing the calving of the glacier is a totally dramatic experience: that thunder like noise, the cracking.... Once in Alaska, this tour is a must.

We were the only ones on it during our visit so we got a chance to really enjoy what the NPS has done to the area. The only negative was the Visitor Center was already closed for the season despite the 55 F temp. The parking lot was being repaved during our visit so getting in and out was like a combat obstetrical course, be careful not to run over anybody. The view from ""down below"" was really something, the route is carefully marked out as to where to walk and where not to go, again great job NPS.","September 30, 2016",Nice visit not to be missed,73,"Worcester, MA",5

We passed by Holgate Glacier We saw one whale, some Mountain Goats and other wildlife. This tour was a highlight of our trip! From our group of 4, no one got sea sick. The captain took most of the waves head on or 3/4's on so we didn't have the side to side motion that can make one queasy.

The crispness of the air and the beauty of the park were inspiring. It's incredibly sobering to see the years marked where Exit Glacier used to extend. Now, it's a mere shell of its former self but still beautiful, nonetheless. The hike was not too difficult. My mother is older and not in the best shape so it was more difficult for her, but we took it slowly so she was also able to enjoy the glacier as well. Beautiful spot and worth the visit to Kenai Fjords National Park.

Every year we can tell who takes Dramamine, because they are the ones sleeping during the tour. The longer tours are fantastic, but use a non sleepy alternative to sea sickness so you avoid sleeping away a wonderful beautiful experience.

No matter what the weather is I would suggest getting out on the water for all age groups! Don't think about the cost, most likely it will be one of the most beautiful places ever visited.

The weather was terrific, the sky incredibly blue, almost no clouds and the scenery was spectacular. I took over 140 photos with my regular camera (bring a good zoom for wildlife pictures because the animals are far away) and quite a few with my IPhone. The landscape is so stunning you want to try to capture it but you can't, you have to go and see it for yourself. We saw almost tame playful sea otters, different species of seals, whales (but they were shy and did not put up a show) and all kind of birds. The glaciers are amazing. Too bad they are melting. This trip brought global warming to the forefront, the cruise ship had photos of glaciers from the early 20th century to today and you can see the toll.

We had hoped to do a 3-hour boat tour, but they were not running this late in the season - that was too bad.The trails to Exit Glacier were quite nice - and very manageable for most people. There were some great photo ops along the way - and the glacier was amazing. There had been a diversion of the flow in the days prior to my visit - so there was a lot of talk among the rangers and guides about that fact.The visitor center is also great - with some interactive exhibits as well as a nice gift shop.I would highly suggest visiting this park if you have the chance when in Seward!","September 7, 2016",Beautiful Park - Great Trails,9,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

We saw humpback and killer whales, otters, eagles, harbor seals, and calving glaciers, just to name a few. Kenai Fjord Tours did a great job of getting us up close and personal to the wildlife. Don't worry if it's a stormy day. The tour boat is comfortable and cozy. It has large windows, if you don't want to venture outside in the elements. It included breakfast and lunch. To be fair, breakfast was a small freshly baked cinnamon roll, juice and a fruit cup, do if you are used to a bigger breakfast I suggest you eat before you arrive.

A pod of 6 or 7 came towards the boat to see us. Another great thing about going on Major Marine yours is that they have a National Park ranger onboard to tell you the history and ecology of the park. Kids can also earn their Jr Ranger badges.

People see moose and bear and mountain goats here, but we didn't. Ambitious hikers continue past the Glacier to the ice fields (we didn't).2) Kenai Fjords Boat Tour - Major Marine Tours, $$, 7.5 hours. This tour is worth every penny. Not only do you see three glaciers on the tour (two up close), but you see TONS of sea life! We saw orcas, humpback whales, puffins, steller sea lions, otters, harbor seals and more.

Shuttle services are available from Seward to Exit Glacier.Our first day at Kenai Fjords we took a 5-hour boat tour of Resurrection Bay and Gulf of Alaska with Major Marine Tours that was narrated by a park ranger. We spotted bald eagles, mountain goats, sea lions, humpback whales, puffins and lots of other birds. We also cruised by Bear Glacier. The dock and boat had wheelchair access, although the ramp onto the dock was steep so assistance is recommended.On the second day, we drove about 10 miles from Seward to Exit Glacier. The entrance road was under construction, but it only delayed us 10-15 minutes. Near the parking area there's a nice nature center and a restroom. No fee is charged here. Trails leave from the nature center and lead closer to the glacier. One is partially-paved and suitable for wheelchairs; it goes about 1/2 mile to an overlook with binoculars and great view of the glacier. Another trail ventures about 1/2 mile further right to the base of the glacier, but it is a footpath with grades and some rough, rocky, slippery surfaces.

Regardless, it was a very beautiful hike to Exit Glacier and the cruise through the fjords was very nice too. It was incredible to learn about how much the glaciers have reduced in size over the years- and a little frightening! We were sad that the National Park sign was down for construction- it is a tradition of ours to take a picture with the park signs. Hopefully the construction will be over soon for other visitors.

The small boats talk with each other to relay sittings of marine animals and the crew also knew what to look for including the behavior of the birds that indicated whales were nearby. We saw Orcas, humpbacks, Eagles, otters, porpoise, seals and sea lions. It is a beautiful trip through unspoiled waters and the proximity to the glacier was incredible.

Its an amazing hike, and goes though quite a bit of terrain. We were there in July and the last 3rd of the hike was over well-trodden snowpack.Driving and hiking only gets to a small fraction of the park, so you'll need to book a plane or a boat to see any of the rest of it. We took a boat tour out of Seward harbor and got amazingly lucky with the weather and water. Its an incredible experience when the weather is warm, the skies are blue, and the ocean is flat.

The bus took us to the visitor centre and told us we had to be back on board in about an hour, no directions or instructions or a map, just a mirriad of paths and a total fear of getting lost and missing the bus!. It was very hard too see anything for trees and folliage so basically it was just a bit of a disorgonised forrest wallk!.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"The tour is amazing, however 8 hours was a bit long. The crew were great, we saw everything imaginable and have some terrific shots. My complaint revolves around the description of a continental breakfast and lunch. At 175 a person ( a family of five ) I thought our nausea was a combo of hunger with the waves. We are a fit family, not looking for an all you can eat menu! But when you get lined up for a small cinnamon roll and some packaged fruit cocktail, for breakfast, things are looking bad. There is a charge for coffee, soda, anything that might help your upset tummy. Anti nausea pill and gum 7.50.Lunch came ...a wrap and a half glass of water. They bake delicious cookies that you get a half hour before you depart. So my advice is to bring food to nosh on and some bottled water. Or you will spend a lot of cash on some bad snacks.

The trail is well marked and maintained, but fairly steep. On June 18, the trail was pretty much snow covered above Marmot Meadows, flagged up to the cliffs, but basically closed above that due to snow and risk of avalanche. There was also bear activity around the bottom of the trail. Check the NPS website or ranger station for alerts before you head up.Views of the glacier and valley were very good.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We experienced Kenai Fjords National Park on land and water; both are highly recommended. There is so much to see and do that it is definitely worth multiple days and return visits. Our ""land"" part was at Exit Glacier. We hiked up to the glacier which was both impressive and sad. Our last visit was in 2003, and it was amazing how different it looked in 2016 as it moved farther up. The trail was well maintained and had helpful signage about how much farther out the glacier used to extend. We also hiked a little of Harding Icefield Trail, which was more challenging and afforded excellent views. We definitely want to return and hike much farther up to see the icefield.For the water part, we took a cruise tour and saw wildlife, glaciers, and more of the fjords. This was equally, if not more, impressively beautiful than the hiking we did. Both were not to be missed.

The other half is a less-than-strenuous climb for almost all ages.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"I can't say enough about this trip. We booked the 8.5 hour trip with the Fox Island dinner. Everyone in our party was nervous about the excursion being SO long. We ended up enjoying every minute of it. We saw humpback whales before fully leaving the harbor! Then another. Then another. The captain actually said that there was so much to do on the trip and that there would be so many whales that he just couldn't stop for every one of them. He was right but if there was an active whale or a whale close to the boat, he would pull towards it so everyone could see. But this trip isn't just about the whales (although it was what I was thinking would be the best part), the glaciers were AMAZING! You are able to pull up super close to the glacier and the crew actually scooped up pieces floating in the water for people on the ship to touch. You will never experience the glaciers like this. Even on our cruise ship when we pulled up close to Hubbard Glacier, it was close but not as grand as the glaciers in Kenai Fjords National Park. We saw baby seals float by on pieces of glacier. We saw hundreds of different kinds of birds. We saw salmon jumping from the water and dolphins glide by the ship. We were fortunate to travel on a sunny day but it was still freezing outside on the bow while the ship was in motion. Be prepared and dressed appropriately. When you first get on board, everyone rushes for the seats on the top deck. No need. Find a great seat below deck. There are plenty of windows and when things are spotted, people will rush outside anyway and, top or bottom, you won't be able to see past them so find yourself somewhere below where it's warm and near the hot cocoa and coffee. We had 3 adults and 2 teens on this trip. Every one of us would give this more than 5 stars if we could.","June 23, 2016",Best excursion out of all excursions taken on 2 week trip!,2,"Bella Vista, Arkansas",5

They even had a Junior Ranger program to try to keep the little kids entertained. That being said, the little kids were bored out of their mind.

A lot of mountain climbing for a couple of old people, but well worth it. The trail to the ice fields is very difficult- make sure you are in good shape before you try it. Couldn't go all the way due to snow on the trail, but had a good view of the ice field. Went on to Byron Glacier the next day. It was pouring down rain, but we hiked it anyway, and glad we did! It is Alaska- be prepared for rain. Get yourself some Gortex rain gear. The visitor center is nice with a good history display of the area.","June 15, 2016",This place is amazing!,22,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Since I moved to Alaska 4 years ago, I've done the Resurrection Bay Tour with my husband on May 2015 and the National Park Tour with Fox Island with my family on July 2015. Both of the tours included free pass to the Alaska SeaLife Center which is a must go place to visit when in Seward. I love that place. Anyways, the Resurrection Bay Tour was about 4ish hours long while the National Park Tour with Fox Island was 8ish hours long. Weather was great both times I did the tours. Both tours I saw seat otters and plenty of birds. I think on the Resurrection Bay Tour, my husband and I saw a few humpback whales, some porpoises, and some dolphins. We saw more humpback whales with my family on the National Park Tour with Fox Island. Plenty of harbor seals and different kinds of birds on both trips. I think on the National Park Tour with Fox Island we lucked out on seeing a mountain goat or was it a Dall sheep? Nonetheless, both tours were pleasant. I would say take Dramamine or motion sickness medication if you get sea sick like I do. Both trips include food. The National Park Tour with Fox Island we get to eat on Fox Island and the stay is just a little over an hour long. Food was great. I had some family members who had the crabs added to their menu. A great thing-to-do when in Seward.","June 7, 2016",A great time in the sea!,2,,5

I really have no words to use in reviewing the breathtaking beauty the Capt of the boat takes you. We sat at the Glacier for 30-40 minutes and we saw lots of calving. Then there is the dinner.... I've done tours that serve a dinner and its been so/so at best. This dinner was great, and I have to say the Salmon was better that the Salmon I had the previous night at a 'higher-end' restaurant. I really feel this one of the best tours I have ever done, and I done my share. This is worth every penny. I do have two tips....get in line early. The other, know where you stand with sea-sickness, but do not let this sway you. There is about 30 minutes of semi-rough area as they approach one area. I use the wrist sea bands, and took a Bonine in the a.m. The rest of the trip is like your local lake.","June 2, 2016",Best Tour Bar-None!!!,60,"Ukiah, California",5

There are seals, as well as dall porpoise that will lead the boat. They're unbelievably fast!! They look a lot like small orcas. You'll see what our naturalist called flying potatoes, the puffin. They are the cutest birds, but when you see one flying toward you, duck. The have very little ability to turn, you could get whacked by one, which I'm sure doesn't feel the greatest:-(. If you look closely on the rocks right above the waves when you slow down, you'll sea beautiful sea stars. There are lots of birds that look similar to penguins, but these fly very well. Then there's the scenery. Simply unbelievable!!! We got to see a calving glacier with a couple of mountain goats climbing the rocks nearby. The waterfalls were gorgeous!!!!

Really put into perspective the rate at which the glaciers are receding. A worth while day spent here. ","September 24, 2015",Stunning National Park!,88,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"One of the big to-do's on my AK trip was Harding Icefield hike. I had read so much about its steep grade incline, change in weather and whatnot that in my head I was climbing Everest!! At this point, I should clarify I am not a climber or advanced hiker but I am moderately fit and stay active through the year. I think the difficulty level of this hike is MASSIVELY overrated. I did the full hike (actually, a little more by going off the trail after reaching the top) and it took it less than 6hrs of walking time. The trail is quite popular in summer so there is a defined route and lots of people. It is slightly steep but quite safe. I ever saw kids, teens and seniors (70+) at the summit. In winter/shoulder seasons snow and high winds might be different conditions making it more difficult. Just a guess... Only saw mountain goats on my trip. But repeat hikers mentioned seeing black bears and moose in the area as well. If nothing, this is still worth it for scenic exercise before Exit glacier completely disappears.","September 23, 2015",Harding Icefield hike - a good day trip,1,"Chicago, Illinois",4

We had a very agreeable humpback who put on quite a show for us! We saw myriads of birds (including puffins) and lots of harbor seals. However, the highlight of the trip was our journey alongside the Aialik Glacier. We got ""up close and person"" with this glacier and watched a good deal of calving being done.

While we had great weather and were quite lucky in our sightings, and there's no guarantee it will be this good for you, it is very likely that you'll see many of these things.

Dress warmly though in september because being outside and going 21 knots can get chilly. we saw hump back whales, otters, seals, sea lions, bald eagles, puffins, lots of other birds i cannot remember the names of. food was served for lunch not long after we departed and it was better than i thought it would be. i really cant say anything bad about this tour. will definitely do the longer one where they stop along the way and offer buffet style food.","September 11, 2015",Much Better than i had expected,16,"Savannah, Georgia",5

There were a lot of beautiful little islets and islands among the fjord waters that looked amazing. The tour also brought us into Aialik Bay to view the Holgate Glacier at a fairly close distance.I visited the park in mid-July, and it was pretty cold when outside the boat, especially when we were traveling in the colder waters to Holgate Arm.","September 11, 2015",One of the favorite parts of my Alaska trip,214,New Jersey,5

On the boat ride to the lodge in the park, we saw lots of puffins, sea otters. At the lodge we kayaked up to calving glaciers, saw salmon spawning, bald eagles, more sea otters with their babies, and seals molting on the icebergs, a black bear eating blueberries.

A park ranger gave a talk about the park using photos that were shown on individual TVs hung at various points around the huge room. Afterward, there was another person who brought an owl and another bird from a bird sanctuary and gave and educational wildlife talk.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We drove to Seward from Anchorage, a lovely journey. We chose to drive rather than take the more-popular train because it was our first full day in Alaska and we wanted to walk along creeks, breathe the cool, fresh air and stop for mountain vistas. We left about seven a.m. And arrived in Seward four hours later. We stayed in town for a two-hour self-guided tour, then headed back to Exit Glacier. The hills are glorious and the trail up to the national park standard. As glaciers go, this is a sad one, having retreated significantly over the years. There is none of the deep blue you see in other glaciers, but rather a dirty slush like you see on the street side after the snow has been shoveled. You do get marvelous views of the valley and outwash so if you like hiking, it's a great hike. If you like healthy glaciers, then the cruises are a better option. If you arrange your time carefully, you can drive to make the cruise then hike Exit on the return so you'll have the benefit of both views, but this would require strict discipline to scheduling and would easily be a 12 hour day.","September 4, 2015",A somber walk in the woods,86,"Jerusalem, Israel",4

Kenai Fjords National Park,"This review is in regards to booking through TripAdvisor / Viator. Do not do it. I suggest trying to book directly with Kenai Fjords (CIRI). I can't see any benefits to booking with them, only additional risk.We booked through Viator, got confirmation, credit card was charged. A day later they informed me it was overbooked and not available, offering me the same cruise 2 days later. We also booked and paid for transportation the same afternoon to the airport in Anchorage - also not refundable as many of these excursions and transfers are.I sent in my complaints and all I got back was a pretty generic email that the refund is processed in full and they're sorry for the inconvenience. No future discount or any discount for anything offered to make up for their mistake. Not to mention it'll take up to a week to get the funds back on my credit card.They've left our party with a gap in my itinerary .. boat docks at 5AM, bus leaves at 6:30PM.

The lunch (chicken or hummus wraps) were quite delicious, and the catamaran quite smooth. Only a few folks felt a bit sea sick, but that can happen to anyone. The captain was amazing, and we saw quite a few whales and other animals in the water! He was good at showing us birds as well nesting in the rocks, and also a huge huge shoal of jellyfish migrating, we were right on top of it! They usually enter the Aialik glacier, and if weather does not permit, Holgate.

Stellar sea lions, many Puffins and amazingly how sea gulls nest on the smallest of crevices on a seemingly flat surface of a rock face. The seemed like thousands of Gulls. We were also taken to yet another Glacier where the crew brought a good sized piece of Glacier ice onboard so we could all have our photos taken with the ice.

The ""hike"" to exit glacier is easy and the glacier a wonder to see. Pay attention to all the signs showing the years of where the glacier used to be...this if anything shows the effect that global warming is doing to the environment. We never did the Harding ice fields as the rain was too much for the 12 year old with us but many people did leave with the ranger. My only suggestion would be to have the ranger lead hikes at least two days a week during the season as many families want to go but do not, as they do not feel secure in bear country without company.","August 18, 2015",Even in th rain,78,"Westborough, Massachusetts",5

Captain was a hoot, dry sense of humor but very informative. Doesn't really matter where you sit since you go running up on the deck, wherever you find an opening, and watch the critters from there, once their position is announced by the captain or other people who spot them.Dinner was ok, you wait in a line to get served steak and salmon and side dishes.

A lot of the guides say this is an easy hike to the glacier. And perhaps one day it was. But not anymore. A few years ago the hike was mostly on level land. But has the glacier has retreated, it's a more difficult hike over some rocks and with some elevation gain. Our 12 year old had no trouble but one of party (with a sore foot) did. Still, the glacier is good to look at. It is not wheelchair accessible.","August 8, 2015",Exit Glacier is a nice hike,99,michigan,5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We'd taken this tour sixteen years ago with our brother. A marine mammal biologist from Anchorage, he said this was the best tour in the area. He was right. So, when we returned with our son and grandson, we took them to see the fjords, the glacier, and all the critters. We understand, of course, that seeing critters depends not on the tour but on the whims and vagaries of animal migration, mating, and feeding. However, because our guide was knowledgeable and because the company's guides communicate frequently with each other, they were able to maximize our tour. We saw a pod of orcas (more than we could count), several humpbacks came close the the boat and breached nearby, sea otters, Stellar's sea lions, bald eagles, cormorants, puffins (both kinds), mountain goats .... and that magnificent but shrinking (alas) glacier. Lunch was fine (chicken caesar wrap) and, at the end of the tour, freshly baked cookies. If you wake up in the morning and it is raining or overcast, don't be dissuaded. The critters are plentiful and don't seem to notice the weather at all (whales, as you know, are already wet). Please, if you are a the least bit prone to motion sickness, take a dramamine. Please. I've sailed on sailboats in bays, on lakes in the ocean; I'm pretty immune to seasickness, but once passengers start hurling on the deck (sheesh, at least try for the rails, people), everyone on board feels queasy. Personnel, because of cutbacks, are overtaxed. They are still pleasant, but tourists can help by taking care of themselves a bit, pick up their own trash, and not be too demanding. Remember, you are on a real boat in real waters with real water dangers. No Disneyland ride this. Be kind. ","July 30, 2015",Whales galore.,7,"Reno, Nevada, United States",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Very difficult. Take your time. Try to get to the top of the cliffs at least. I did it to the end of the trail and it s great but top of the cliffs is pretty good too.I would recommend it to everyone - I am not very good at hiking myself but it was beautiful day, clear , didn't rain and while I personally didn't see them - I met hikers along the way who had seen marmots and call sheep and bear.There s a valley of flowers once you get above the Marmot meadows in July-August and it s beautiful, juxtaposed against the snowy peaks, green alpine meadows and the exit glacier. Make sure to get good hiking shoes or your feet would be soaking wet. And, cannot stress this enough. Take your time - sit down and take pictures. The 6-8 hours time factors in the time you would take to sit down every 15 mins and take pictures.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"I knew I wanted to see a glacier after being in the wilderness of Alaska. I needed to see the coast. I made a reservation for the six hour tour and arranged to take a bus from Anchorage early in the morning. Perfect timing. Got to Seward, checked in at the Kenai Fjords Center and was told my boat would be leaving slightly early since there were two boats going out that day. OMG, was I glad my boat left early. We came upon a huge number of humpback whales working together to catch fish. I know that sounds difficult to imagine but I have the pictures to prove it. Our Captain was a female who not only had a great voice but was extremely knowledgable of the animal activity and life in the waters in which we travelled. I met several people there who were in awe of the whole experience but I also met many who were seasick and I'm not sure why. Inexperience? Must say the lunch was fine. I was not there for the food particularly. It was the perfect amount of time. I would not have wanted to spend longer on the boat, but that's just me. I saw more than I expected to since mainly I wanted glacier, everything else was icing on my Alaskan cake. Our weather was very good but it does get cold when the boat is under power so you need to have a jacket or to go inside when it picks up speed. They sell stuff for seasickness on the boat so don't worry about that. It is a must see activity while in southern Alaska. Do yourself the favor, spend the money I believe you will enjoy.","July 21, 2015",Perfect Ending to My Trip,14,"Tampa, Florida",5

They are longer hikes up to the icefield up top if you want. Good place to spend a couple hours to see part of the park without going in a boat or plane.","July 21, 2015",Worth The Drive To Exit Glacier.,852,"Bolingbrook, Illinois",4

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We took the 8 hour tour / cruise which included a stop at Fox Island for dinner. Even though it was raining most of the day, we had a great experience on this cruise. The boat is very nice and spacious. We had approximately 100 folks on our cruise. I think the boat will accommodate up to 150 people. There are plenty of places to sit (with a table) all beside huge clean windows. You can sit outside on the bow, the top or the stern if you prefer. Or you can stay inside the very comfortable cabin. The crew working the tour were very friendly and knowledgeable. They worked hard to make sure everyone was happy, safe, and saw the wildlife. The tour/cruise included lunch (chicken wrap) served on the boat for lunch and a wonderful buffet meal of fresh salmon and prime rib served on the lodge on beautiful Fox Island. On the tour we saw all kinds of sealife including orca (killer) whales, humpback whales, a couple other types of whales, otters, seals, sea lions, dall's porpoises, puffins, bald eagles, and all kinds of other birds. We also saw several glaciers and the crew even scooped up some ice off one of the glaciers so we could all hold it and look at it. The scenery was absolutely amazing. We saw Dall's sheep on the snow capped cliffs and mountainsides. We learned alot about the history of Alaska, sea life, and glaciers. This tour/cruise is a must do if you are visiting the Kenai Peninsula. This tour is a bit pricey but they have sales throughout the year.

The highlight was seeing close to 20 humpback whales indulging in collective feeding behaviour which had them bursting out of the water with mouths agape to scoop up all the little fish they had apparently corralled with bubbles. The swarming squealing seagulls and the grunts of these magnificent cetaceans made for an unforgettable experience. This was National Geographic stuff right before your eyes and I almost looked around for David Attenborough. Not 15 minutes after that the orcas made an appearance on both sides of the boat.

A third trail, rated as strenuous and taking up to eight hours, goes up much higher. If you take that one, be prepared for cold winds and weather generated by the glacier. The trail is marked with signs indicating the rapid shrinking of the glacier. Take the ranger led hike on the medium level trail for maximum benefit. Don't miss this one; it is fast disappearing!

We took a wildlife boat tour (separate review) and saw eagles, otter, humpbacks, puffins, goats, sea lions and glaciers! We saw Ailek glacier calving! On land, we hiked the Harding Icefield trail. WATCH OUT FOR BEARS. We started the hike early on a rainy Tuesday morning, around 7:30 am. Not even a mile up the trail, we came around a bend and hubby saw a momma bear with cub just 30-40 feet off the trail. We stood quietly and hoped they would keep moving since at that point we were too close. We hadn't been making much noise and with the rain I'm sure it would have been hard for the bears to hear us. Baby spotted us and without a second thought, momma started charging us. We did what you're supposed to do in that situation- get big, stand your ground, and yell like hell! It worked. But I wasn't too interested in finishing the hike that day, so we returned to do it on Saturday morning, once more folks had been out, and it was SO WORTH IT! Hike to the end! AMAZING! We didn't see any bears that day but others we passed on the trail said they had seen black bears. BE PREPARED! Know what to do! Wear a bear bell! It's the best $4 you'll spend.

They only charge $10 per person, round trip, to get a ride to the Exit Glacier hike. All you need is a comfortable pair of shoes, a water bottle, and layered clothing to take this easy hike.

We were lucky enough to see orcas, dall porpoises, sea otters, several different birds, sea lions, and a humpback whale breaching out of the water. We were also fortunate to see and hear Aliak Glacier calving. It was incredible! During the cruise KFT served a tasty caesar chicken wrap with chips and a bottle of water for lunch. About four hours later we stopped at Fox Island for a prime rib and salmon dinner. The prime rib was very good. The salmon was just mediocre. The sides of tossed salad, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables were all good. After dinner we had about twenty minutes to explore the island a bit. We stayed on the beach skipping the perfectly round and flat rocks. It brought out the kid in all of us (even my 81 year-old father enjoyed skipping stones)!

Kenai Fjords National Park,"A visit to the park by way of one of the tour companies in Seward is a must, I lived in Alaska for 16 years and still go almost every summer. I recommend the Glacier cruise with the stop at Fox Island for lunch. The food is ok, stop somewhere else for great Alaska seafood. On the the Glacier cruise you'll see lots of wildlife but spend more time looking at the glaciers, which are breathtaking. The reason I'm not fond of the wildlife cruise is that you spend a lot of time looking at birds. Especially different types of seagulls, you'll see them everywhere. The puffins are cool though, but they are all over the place, as are the sea otters. Whales can usually be seen on any of the cruises, but they aren't always very active. The last glacier cruise I went on, I saw 5 whales. Bring a telephoto lens, and binoculars for sure. Dress for cool weather in layers, and possible rain. Warm hat and gloves, in case it gets nasty out. You can always sit inside though, but when you stop to view something it can still be cold. Don't forget sunglasses.

The glacier had pieces big and small falling off into the bay and the sound was like thunder. Even though it was long, we were never bored and it was the best day of our trip in Alaska.

It seems obvious but I will say it anyway the more time you spend on the water the more likely you are to see wildlife.. Glaciers calving…. And all the other things that that you go on one of these tours to see. We spent three weeks doing a land tour on our own and this was one of the highlights. We saw so many whales that the captain stopped trying to go from pod to pod. The fjord in glacier were very impressive as was the entire tour. Bring lots of different layers of clothing….

It's 7 miles in to Lost Lake and 7 miles back out. There are other options, which are longer, but this is the one we chose.Get a picnic lunch and have a picnic at the top of the mountain before heading down again to Lost Lake.We went through alpine forest, meadows, mountains, streams, and the scenery was magnificent. It was Fall in Alaska and the colors were beautiful. When you get to the top, you can see Resurrection Bay on one side and Lost Lake on the other side of the trail. Mountains and glaciers on the other sides.Wear layers and good walking shoes or boots. We started out cool, got very warm, and then when we got to the top it was cold... there are no trees to stop the wind. We saw very few people and thought we would see some wildlife and birds, but they were not to be seen this day. I would recommend this hike if you have 5 or 6 hours to enjoy the scenery and views. There are a few areas of rocks and water to cross which are manageable for most folks.

The end of the road is the parking area to walk out to the Exit Glacier, part of the Harding Ice Field. Pretty remarkable to get that close to a glacier. We were here about 8 years ago, and see the difference in glacial recession since then. You'll see the year markers posted along the access route, and see how the glacier moves. It's a 1.5 mile hike out to the glacier, be prepared for rocky, and uneven terrain. There are easier paths out to the flats.

The chances of that happening are great. Someone did get sea sick on the boat and the staff was gracious about cleaning it up without any comment. The staff also was quite accommodating to the more mature people on the boat, helping with carrying plates of food or lending a steady hand. Jen was the National Park Ranger who led the narration. She loves her job and it shows. We did both Prince William Sound and Kenai Fjords. Kenai was the better of the 2 if you are pressed for time or money. Marine wildlife we saw was Orcas a whole bunch, one breeched like you see on tv. We got to see it in person. Spectacular site. Humpbacks and Dall's porpoises. Holgate glacier was calving like crazy and this time I did hear the thunderous sound of it and got amazing photos. I also saw the ripple of waves created from the calving. I got the glacier ice margarita this time. It's only 3.00 for no alcohol or 4 with. Soo worth it. This tour was the 6 hour tour. The rugged coast line of this part of Alaska is like no other.

They really lived up to every positive review! We were fortunate to have the perfect day, which always helps, but I think it would have been a great trip regardless. We chose the 4.5 hour cruise with stop on Fox Island because we have kids and felt the longer cruises would be too much, and this was ideal for our purposes.

There are sign posts along the way that tell you what year it was the last time the glacier came to there, before it receded further in. A handful of the signs are from fairly recent history and are stunning reminders of how quickly the glaciers are melting and receding. Waders/waterproof boots are a good idea if you want to walk across the outwash plains, as there is a steady run-off, but it is not neccessary to cross and you can stay dry even if you want to explore a little and walk just part of the field. We wandered and explored for a few miles and were done in under 3 hours.There is good parking, and un-plumbed toilets (port-a-potties) available, but you should be ready with your own toilet paper just in case they run out.","September 2, 2014",Gorgeous,15,"Clayton, California",5

I also helped out keeping them talking and their eyes focused on something (never close your eyes if you are feeling sea sick).

As we started up to Aialik glacier we began to hit ice and fog, which we thought was normal, but it ends up it was not normal at all. Even with two captains we almost didn't go to the glacier. The glacier was calving. This was 1000 times better than our Norway fjord trip. We had a nice buffet dinner at fox island, everything was well tuned. There was a great talk by a lady ranger.

The mother and calf smacked the water with their fins and one of them jumped repeatedly out of the water. It was breathtaking. The water was absolutely calm and the boat ride was smooth, which made the boat tour outstanding.Had I known the water would be so calm (NOAA reported 3 foot seas that day), we would have done the 8.5 or 7.5 hour tour instead of the 6 hour one.

This park is huge, no wait, MASSIVE! There is something for everyone here. There are glacier experiences at Exit Glacier, hiking in the park, fly overs in bush planes, and my favorite; glacier and wildlife cruises through Major's Marine Tours. The Marine boat tours are probably the best way to see the park even though you will only see a small portion of it. From the boats you will see wildlife, glaciers, mountains, eagles, whales, sea lions, and possibly so much more. The tours are not too expensive and are a great way to rest and relax, especially if you spent the previous week hiking like we did. We love this place and want to go back again. You will also want to hike the Lost Lake trail outside of town for spectacular views of the park and surrounding area. Beautiful trail but be prepared to overnight or deal with weather as thing change fast on the trail. My favorite trail in all of Alaska.

It was very rough sea but we saw lots of wildlife. It was wonderful to experience the calving of a glacier.The second day we went to Exit Glacier and Harding Icefield. It was a saturday so we could join a free guided rangerwalk. Rangers Joey and Debby took very good care of us.It is a strenuous hike (roundtrip 8.2 miles) but worth every drop of sweat.(you can always go back but I would recommend at least going to Top of Cliffs)You can do the hike on any day you like but as it is bearcountry I felt more safe during the rangerwalk.","August 17, 2014","Glaciers, wildlife and hiking",99,Belgium,5

Only bad thing this year is that the river is running such that you can't easily walk up to the bottom of Exit Glacier. My son just HAD to touch the glacier, so there was a complicated way to get around the river and to the glacier which involved climbing through some bushes/small trees growing up against the rock. It's not as dangerous as it sounds and worth the effort. Only need about 2 hours to see most of everything...except the Harding Ice Field hike, which is an 8-9 hour hike and not for the casual hiker.","August 8, 2014",Great Exit Glacier hiking for family,28,"Pearland, Texas",5

We are from Florida and were glad we wore layers for this small hike as once we got close to the glacier, the winds were VERY cold. We did meet people from Colorado who were wearing shorts, but they must be accustomed to freezing temps all the time.

Between the sightings of many marine mammals, such as the playful Dall Porpoise to the Northern Sea Otters chopping their urchin meal with a rock, I got exactly what I came for...as many Alaska wildlife sightings as possible. The longer you are on the water the more chances of seeing life. Harbor Seals, Steller's Sea Lions, Mountain Goats, Puffins, Bald Eagles and Cormorants graced us on our adventure.On our boat route we observed many glaciers, such as Bear and Porcupine and we learned a lot about the geology of the area before and after the 1964 earthquake in Prince William Sound. Quite the scenery, where mountains, ice and sea are together in one place.My teen nephew had a blast working on the Jr. Park Ranger program on the boat, and as participated with him as he went through the pages.

We chose the 6 hour version (even though it sounded long - it was not). We wanted to get the fullest experience of Resurrection Bay and still be back out of the boat by around 2 PM as we were travelling to Soldotna that day. You DO need to arrive a bit early as parking on the pier is limited and you need to take a free shuttle bus from the approved parking area. Our boat left at 8 AM and returned at 2 PM. We loved our Captain – Brian and our crew. They were incredibly knowledgeable. The chicken wrap was yummy and they surprise you with home made chocolate chip cookies too. Because it was iffy weather we chose to sit inside and I was happy we did. You can always move around. We had a window seat right near the galley and were able to easily move about the boat.

We saw many wales (humpback and Fin) frolicking and breaching, tons of birds including Bald Eagles, the adorable puffins and cormorants and gulls galore! We witnessed the glaciers calving with huge chunks of ice falling off and crashing into the sea. The mountains and rock formations rising out of the sea are beyond words in beauty. WE experienced several pods of Dahl porpoises chasing and racing our boat - jumping and diving within a couple of feet from the boat while steaming full speed - it was AMAZEBALLS!!!

There is another trail that's an easy hike to the ""toe"" of Exit Glacier. It's worth going out to, but you can't touch or climb on the glacier from this trail. The visitor center is small, but worth exploring a little.The biggest challenge to this NP is that it's not very accessible.

I suspect that it works out to about one foot a day - unprecedented.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"First, let's clear up a bit of confusion; Kenai Fjords National Park is part of the US National Park system and includes Exit Glacier and the Harding Ice Field, in addition to the miles and miles of coastal area accessible only by boat. The Kenai Fjords National Park boat tours are operated by a privately owned Alaksa Native company. They do an absolutely wonderful job of getting people to see the abundant wildlife of the area. We saw whales,puffins, seals, otters, sea lions, eagles and also saw a glacier calving into the ocean. A truly magnificat sight! The captain did everything possible so that people on both sides of the boat could see the wildlife. Be sure to dress in layers and bring rain gear. Bring binoculars if you have them. It was not really a rough day, but one passenger was sick, so if you are prone to motion sickness, take precautions before you go. If your small kids have trouble with a 6 or 8 hour tour, bring some toys or books for them. Lunch is not bad and they also sell snacks, soft drinks, etc. at reasonable prices, but you might want to bring your own snacks and water.","July 8, 2014",Our best experience in Alaska!,34,"Orlando, Florida",5

It was quite enjoyable to hear her knowledge of the wildlife, glaciers, mountains etc that we passed. She was also great about pivoting the boat so you didn't have to walk back and forth from one side to another to see!

This is an easy hike (there were people pushing baby strollers on it). Seeing the glacier was amazing! 2of us also hiked to Harding Ice Field. It was a strenuous hike but absolutely worth it. We also visited Aialik glacier by kayak. This was breathtaking. We watched the glacier calve and heard it as well. There are many ways to see this glacier (tour boats, kayak trips) so anyone can do it. Aialik glacier is not to be missed. Please note that even in the summer it is not warm here. You will need several layers of clothing to stay comfortable. As they say in Alaska, there is no bad weather, just bad clothing.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"See a glacier before they all disappear! At Exit Glacier you can get close to an actual glacier-- although not as close as you apparently used to be able to get. We hiked to the gravel outlet and enjoyed wandering around watching the river rush past before hiking up to the face of the glacier itself. It's a straightforward hike (my two kids <6 years old did it with no problems). My kids loved the Junior Ranger program at Kenai Fjords. They learned a lot by doing the activity booklets. The NPS rangers are so nice and so happy to humor them.

We went right up to the face of a glacier. It was strange to hear all of the cracking and then a delay before the ice tumbled into the bay. Leopard seals followed by puffins, sea lions and many other birds made this probably the best full day tour I have ever taken.Be sure to reserve ahead and go even if the weatehr is cloudy. Any of the tours will be enjoyable with the trip to Northwest Glacier the most spectacular. Those prone to seasickness should use precautions but anything up to 3m swells seemed like a smooth ocean.

Every minute of the way there was something exciting going on in the water from Dall Porpoises and Orcas skimming alongside the boat to Humpback Whales and a Fin whale. The scenery was breathtaking but the absolute reason to go was the experience of pulling practically alongside the glacier, having the boat motor turned off and spending about half an hour LISTENING and watching the glacier calf.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Kenai Fjords National Park has 2 areas. One is the coastal region available via boat tours leaving from Seward, exploring Resurrection Bay and beyond, depending on the trip option you select. Major Marine and Kenai Fjords tours are the two operators serving the coastal park. Choose from shorter or longer tours, smaller or larger boats, with fancy meals or basic ones. I chose to spend a day with Major Marine exploring Northwestern Fjord and would do it again in an instant. I'll write my review of that trip separately, but I chose it because it was longer with more time on the water (I wanted to see sea life and glaciers, not fuss with salmon or prime rib or a stop on an island) in a smaller group. Obviously, taking a cruise is going to cost you something.The other area to explore is Exit Glacier. A short drive out of town, this area allows you to get close to a land glacier (doesn't end in the sea) and choose from a variety of hiking trails that meet different skill and time levels. There's a paved trail, handicapped accessible that gives you a view of the glacier, a slightly longer unpaved trail to the toe of the glacier, and then the Harding icefield trail that will take you to several different viewpoints. I'd recommend taking the Harding Icefield trail as far as marmot meadow if you are up for a bit of a climb, to the cliff top if you have some additional time and energy. The climb occurs over numerous switchbacks, so except for a few spots with steeper steps, it is quite manageable. Whatever you choose, its worthwhile and free!","June 12, 2014","Two distinct areas, both a treasure",115,"Boston, Massachusetts",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,Went to the Exit Glacier nature park center for some advice and then on to the trail to Exit Glacier.

The hike is 4.2 miles up nearly 4,000 of elevation, with about 45 minutes of the hike through snow, which was challenging. After two miles, you get an amazing view of the glacier. The next two miles are above the tree line with amazing views of the ice field and surrounding mountains, plus numerous marmots scampering about. We loved it because the views were breathtaking and the hike was physically challenging, so we were proud of ourselves for having completed it.

We were a little apprehensive on taking the full day tour, however, we enjoyed every minute of it!! We were here, in the first part of June, and the temp was in the upper 60's. It was a little cool, so dress warm and in layers, you can always take it off if you get to warm. While at the glacier the temp dropped about 15 - 20 degrees, so was nice to have the extra warmth. The Captain and First Mate were very friendly and very knowledgeable about the marine life and the area. Lunch was provided, as well as drinks and an afternoon snack. I would suggest sunscreen as the glare off the water is pretty intense. Also binoculars were pretty nice to have and make sure you have plenty of space on your sd card!

Our naturalist John shared alot of information about different aspects of animals, weather, history, etc. And the staff is all quite good at spotting the various wildlife on the shore and in the water - with plenty of opportunities to take photos, or idle and see if the whales would surface near the boat.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"*My review is gonna be useful for those who are visiting Seward in General. I drove Homer-Seward and the driving is an attraction by itself. Take your time and stop at all the viewpoints! I went to Seward last summer, so it was a very hot day. The bugs and mosquitoes were so annoying at the Park. Bring some bug spray! The views are breathtaking. The only thing I regret was I couldn't hike all the way to the top of the Exit Glacier. It's a 8 hours hike but I believe it must be really worth. I took the short hike till the glacier. I think it took me 1 hour or less. When you're getting closer to the glacier the bugs go away. I spent just the morning at the park because I had to catch a Kenai Fjord Cruise. One good thing about summer in Alaska is the days are super long, so you get to do lots of things. My friend and I spent the night camping in a decent campground with a wonderful water view. Taking a shower is not an easy thing in Alaska but we found public but not that clean bathrooms for $2,50-10 min hot shower. We left early the morning after to go to Wrangell. This place is gorgeous! Take more time there instead of spending lots of days at Denali!","February 25, 2014",Absolutely spectacular!,101,"Fortaleza, CE",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"We have been to many national parks. This one is mostly coastal and icy. It is absolutely gorgeous in every respect and is one of our favorites. There are many opportunities to see animals, both land and ocean. There are many species of birds for those who are birders. It is especially appealing if you like boating or kayaking. The glaciers are amazing and you're sure to see some calving take place. The hike to Exit Glacier is well worth the time and effort. It makes you realize how tiny & insignificant we really are in this world.","February 10, 2014",Absolutely beautiful!,50,"Little Rock, Arkansas",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Exit Glacier is easily accessible by foot on a well maintained trail and is definitely worth the time to get an up-close look at a glacier. 2 hrs should be enough time. Next time I go, I will plan more time (6-8 hrs) and hike the trail to the Harding Icefield if it is passable. The Exit Glacier trail is easy but the Harding Icefield trail is strenuous, plan accordingly.However, to enjoy the rest of the park you need a boat or a plane which can be expensive for a family. The NPS has a link to Major Marine Tours and Kenai Fjords Tours on their website. I took the Northwestern Fjord Tour with Kenai Fjords Tours and truly enjoyed the park. It was worth every penny to me. We saw lots of beautiful scenery, glaciers, marine mammals, and marine birds. We were also blessed with beautiful sunshine but it was still quite cold on deck on the boat in the first week of June. Dress in layers and be sure to have an wind proof and water proof outer layer if you want to be on deck.","December 30, 2013",Of course it is great - It's a national park,23,"Fairfax, United States",5

We were astonished by the unusually beautiful water, rock formations, blue glaciers, waterfalls, whales, otters, seabirds, sea lions, just the prehistoric grandeur of the entire day. Getting to stand still on the boat and watch a glacier calving was thrilling beyond words.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We initially viewed the Kenai Fjord National Park from one of the cruise tours out of Seward. But later we decided to check out the hikes around the Exit Glacier area near Seward There are a numerous short trails there, but one fairly long and strenuous trail is the Harding Icefield trail (8.2 round-trip, 4,000 foot climb). It climbs from the valley floor up to the Harding Icefield. Much of the trail follows the Exit Glacier and it's full of beautiful views. My wife and I started too late in the day and only made it halfway. Yet it was my favorite hike of the three weeks that I spent in Alaska (including 8 days in Denali). The Exit Glacier area also has a really nice Fjords National Park visitors center. ","December 5, 2013",Kenai Fjords National Park,20,"Cary, North Carolina",5

A large group of orcas swam alongside our boat for a long time. A humpback whale took special interest on our boat and started circling us. There were so many whales at one point we did not even feel like going out to the deck to see them! The glacier was active, we saw it break. Our captain fished out glacier ice for us. But beware!! Apparently it is said that if you touch the glacier ice you cannot go back to Alaska again!!Even in the beginning of may it was too chilly to stand at the deck.

However, there are higher mountains right there. In Alaska, everything is big. We also took a boat to go to the Fjords. Got to see a lot of sea animals: Otters, sea lions, lots of birds, dolphins and humpback wales. Also got to see a glacier caving. It was fantastic.

We came close to the top but we would have needed about another hour of daylight to safely make it.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Highly recommend the trip out to Northwestern Fjord and Glacier. We've done it twice now once on a small boat and once on a larger one. Both trips were spectacular! The marine life is incredibly abundant. Whales, otters, sea lions, seals, Dall porpoise, jumping salmon. The scenery breathtaking, even on the bigger boat the captain took us to some special places he had discovered while kayaking and showed us some cool caves, waterfalls, etc. And the big boat was able to get amazingly close to everything, every bit as close as the smaller boat...which was a concern of ours when we booked the trip. Finally the fjord itself is beautiful. It's fairly narrow so you will be able to check out both shorelines, both on your way in and on your way out. The terminus at the glacier is as beautiful a destination as you could imagine. It was pretty misty when we were in front of the glacier and the mist coupled with the blue, blue calving ice was really special.We went with Kenai Fjords Tours, which was the only company running trips out to this location this time around. Captain Dan was exceptional. REALLY knew his stuff. As I mentioned, we went on this same trip ten years ago on a much smaller boat and at that time thought it was one of the best days of our lives. (Bear viewing in Katmai has since surpassed it but there's no shame in being number two to that!) The combination of a bigger boat and high expectation made us a little wary this time...and yet it did not disappoint. Still one of the greatest days of our lives!

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Some of our best experiences in Alaska were at Kenai Fjords National Park. The boat tour to see marine life and two glaciers was fabulous (see separate review for Major Marine all day tour). The time that we spent at Exit Glacier was fantastic. We only spent two hours at Exit Glacier on the short trails, but we would have tried part of the trail to the Harding Ice Field if we’d just had more time. Whatever the time available, be sure to spend time at Exit Glacier. The glacier is impressive, and Edge of the Glacier trail will yield good views and photos.","August 17, 2013",See It By Boat and On a Trail,1064,"Nashville, Tennessee",5

One thing to look at a glacier from a boat, or at the toe but standing on the top looking down at it is awesome! I recommend bring hiking/trekking poles if you have them. You can hike without them but will have a much better time with them since there are steep and rocky areas. It took us around 7 hours for the roundtrip and we did make lots of stop to take pictures and spent about 30 minutes at the top. Bring lots of water and snacks and/or lunch.Great views and definitely worth the hike.

Not the biggest by far (though the ice field above is) but the fact that they have crafted a beautiful and safe path up to the edge of the glacier (and beyond if you have time) is exceptional. Fell the raw power of the wind as it whips, nearly frozen off the glacier. You can jog the glacier circuit trail in about half an hour round trip. There is a paved path to close up views of the glacier, and a slightly rugged climb a bit further to the glacier side.Trips up top take significantly longer, but I expect would be worth the time invested.","August 12, 2013",Walk on Ice,85,"Lake Havasu City, Arizona",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We spent a day with Major Marine Tours on their 7 1/2-Hour Kenai Fjord Tour. It was a very rewarding tour! This was the first tour like this we did in Alaska--the other was in Valdez. We are still debating among ourselves which was the best. They were both great, but this one seemed perhaps a notch above since it was our first. We saw humpback whales, Orca's, sea lions, lots of birds, and glaciers. During the remaining 20 days of our Alaska trip we did not see humpback whales any better than we saw here at Kenai Fjords. We also saw Orca's breaching a couple of times, more than we saw any other time while in Alaska. Oh, yes, there were a couple of glaciers and the magnificent Kenai Fjord's National Park as well.The Major Marine Tours boat was as comfortable as most others. They assign you to a table but you are free to wonder around the boat. Eventually other people took over our assigned table space since we were largely on the top deck or on the bow. The bow was open all of the time and afforded excellent views of the wildlife and scenery. Be sure you dress warmly in layers. It was a bright sunny day with temperatures in the 60s or even higher on land, but over the water it is much cooler. The water temperature is below 40 degrees. Also, with the boat motion plus the wind over the water there is a strong wind chill. At the glacier the wind patterns brings winter like air roaring down the glacier right at you when you are near it.If you are not that much into nature 7.5 hours may be a bit long. But we may not have seen a good part of the wildlife and a second glacier were it not for the time available on this length of cruise. You have the option of purchasing the hot lunch they provide. Since we did not buy the lunch we didn't pay too much attention to it, but they kept encouraging you to come back for more food, so you had no excuse to go away hungry.This was a unique and wonderful experience.","August 7, 2013",Very Rewarding Tour,40,,5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"We looked forward to our visit to Seward mostly for the Kenai Fjord cruise. Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate and we had rain, fog and clouds the three days we spent there. The morning of the cruise the fog started to lift and the grand mountains started to become visible. I was optimistic about the boat trip. When we arrived at the terminal we were told of a weather alert and that we may not be able to complete the trip. Not paying attention to other recommendations to cancel the trip (which was offered with a full refund) we decided to press on and try our luck. We were told that we would receive a partial refund if we weren't able to complete the whole tour, roughly 45 percent of the cost. As soon as we pulled out the fog lowered and the clouds and rain started. We got to the entrance to the Alaskan Gulf and the captain tried to cross into the next safe inlet. Other boats had tried and failed and we did too. We did see some marine life but very little on land. They still had our morning snack ready and we stopped for lunch instead of dinner on Fox Island. The food was good and it was warm and a nice stop. We still stayed out until around 3:00. When we returned to the dock I expected a huge mess and hours waiting to work out everyone's partial refund. Instead there was a full crew waiting for us with paperwork ready to sign. We received a prepaid debit master card which was issued in seconds with my signature. Although we probably should have cancelled the trip, I didn't want to miss out on any of the beauty and we took our chances. The company was more than ready to deal with the bad weather and appropriate compensation. Kudos, I wish every company did this level of class act when mother nature doesn't cooperate.","August 6, 2013",Watch the weather - still a class act,13,"Tampa, FL",4
Kenai Fjords National Park,"We took the 6 hour trip with Kenai Fjords. Fantastic captain who detoured to find whales bubble feeding and stayed there, even though it meant not getting to a third glacier area. Fine with everyone!! We saw those whales, a lone humpback whale breaching over and over and slapping dorsal fins against the water, calving glaciers, puffins, seals, and an otter. Lunch served is more than adequate (nice to have a vegetarian offering), and leftovers were free. They freshly baked chocolate cookies before we returned. Make an effort to take a tour than gets out of Resurrection Bay, as you will likely see more. If you're worried about making the 6pm train to Anchorage, since the tour ends at 5:30, don't! One, they ran two 11:30 tours the day we were there, and we got on the 11:15 one. Two, if you return at 5:30, you have only 3 blocks to walk to get to the train. Just take your luggage there early. We took ours at 10am.","August 5, 2013",Fantastic Boat Trip,172,"Chapel Hill, North Carolina",5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We took the 9-hour tour to the Northwestern Glacier. For me it was the highlight of our 2 weeks in Alaska (1 week cruising the inside passage, 2 days in Seward, 3 days in Anchorage, 2 days in Denali). The scenery was fantastic but what pushed it to the top was the wildlife. We saw numerous whales (orca and humpback) including a juvenile humpback that breached from the water 3-4 times, sea otters, sea lions, harbor seals and numerous birds including many puffins. The captain said we had an exceptionally good wildlife day, so you might not see as much. If we had seen only half the number of whales we would have been well pleased. The captain and the crew were also fantastic. Captain Dan provided lots of informative and entertaining commentary. The food was much better than expected. Continental breakfast was a fresh baked cinnamon roll, fruit cup & juice. Lunch was a wrap of chicken in Caesar salad served with a granola bar & fresh carrots. They even baked and served chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon. Yummy! Coffee, soda, and snacks were available at reasonable prices (coffee was $1 a cup). You can purchase a souvenir travel mug (choose from 2 styles) that you can refill throughout the day with the beverage of your choice for $8 (as I recall). The boat was clean and comfortable.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"After spending a week on a cruise, we decided that we didn't want to take a boat tour of Kenai Fjords. Instead, we opted to spend a few hours at Exit Glacier. Exit Glacier is approximately 11 miles from downtown Seward. It is an easily drive or bicycle ride from the town. The road is mostly flat. No entrance fee is charged at Kenai Fjords Nat'l Park. There is a visitor's center which was staffed by helpful rangers. A small gift shop/bookstore is located inside of the visitor's center. The rangers can provide you with a trail map. There was a guided walk that was leaving as we arrived that went to the edge of the glacier. We decided to do a self guided hike to the edge of the glacier. There is a 1 mile accessible trail that makes a loop from the parking lot to view points of the glacier. A 1/4 to 1/2 mile trail that leads to the edge of the glacier connects to the accessible trail. There are information boards along the trail that explains about the glacier and the National Park. There are also signs that show where the glacier was located in past years. It's really sad to see how much the glacier has receded in the past few years. At the end of the edge of the glacier trail, you can get fairly close to the glacier. I thought that we would be able to touch it, but it has receded too much. This area is definitely a beautiful place to visit. Unfortunately, I believe that Exit Glacier will cease to exist in 10-15 years. Visit before it's gone. We would love to come back sometime and hike the trail to the Harding Ice Field. We were unable to this time because not everyone in our family was able to hike such a strenuous trail. We didn't see any bears in the park. Overall, this is a nice place to spend a few hours and enjoy nature.","August 1, 2013",Gorgeous National Park,192,"Chula Vista, California",5

Lunch on board was great and all the staff on board were very nice. We got close enough to Aialik glacier that you could actually hear the glacier grinding and we saw several chunks break off.

There is a small Nature Center (including restrooms) with good exhibits and ranger-led activities. A relatively easy hike will take you up close to the glacier and a much longer, harder hike will take you up to the Harding Icefield. There is also a visitor center in town near the docks were you can get information on the park. The rest of this vast park is accessible only by boat or air. There are numerous companies offering everything from kayaking tours to 9-hour cruses on large catamarans that will take you along the shores of the park, or you can take a flight to land on a glacier. I would recommend doing at least a cruise to see the shores of this amazing park and get up close the glaciers and wildlife. Do dress in layers and bring warm clothes, including gloves and hat. Even if is very warm on the land, once you get out on the water in the wind next to a glacier, it will be cold.

This has to be one of the premier day hikes in the park.","July 14, 2013",Beautiful Glaciers,14,"Everett, Washington",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"We took the 11:30Am tour by the Kenai Fjord Tours and it was really awesome. Of course, we did have good weather, but the animals and birds really cooperated. We saw Orcas, Humpback Whales, Sea Otters, a bald eagle, porpoises and, of course, the highlight, the glacier itself.","July 13, 2013",Stunning,218,"Curitiba, PR",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"We did the 9 hour Northwestern Kenai Fjord cruise and the views were fabulous. We saw hump back whales, sea lions, porpoises, birds, jellyfish, water falls, and of course the Northwestern Glacier. Make sure you bring a good camera and wear several layers, including a coat (it's a must). I would recommend you bring your own drinks/snacks and especially get a good breakfast from somewhere in town as they only serve cinnamon rolls and fruit cup ( in other words - sugar) for breakfast. Take Dramamine before getting on the boat because you might get sea sick. We got sick but the staff was terrific. They gave us ginger ale and saltines throughout the trip and continued to check on us to see how were doing. This trip is definitely worth the money!.","July 13, 2013",A must do in Seward!,14,"Wapakoneta, Ohio",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"The hike to the glacier face was not very strenuous at all and worth the time. Because of the melt water covering the trail, we were unable to ""officially"" go to the toe, but followed others on a goat trail to the toe. Again that was worth the effort. It was a very interesting day. Also went on the ranger hike and enjoyed that ","July 13, 2013",Good hike,11,"Ocean Park, Washington",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"I worked on these boats 27 years ago when there were only two boats and tourism had just started in Seward. We were essentially all from the commercial fishing industry at that time and did not have extensive training in dealing with tourists. LOL. Suffice it to say Seward tourism has matured and provides an excellent Alaskan experience.I was very, very impressed with Kenai Fjords boat charter. Our captain was a young women (Capt Rene) and she provided a very informative dialogue throughout our excursion. My daughters (17 and 14) and I enjoyed a beautiful day seeing the tidewater glacier calving, humpback and orca whales, sea lions, sea otters, puffin, eagles, and many other birds.Great trip. great crew. highly recommend.","July 13, 2013",Impressed,5,"Jamaica, New York",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"Four years ago, my daughter (at the time 13 years old) and I attempted the Harding Ice Fields climb but didn't make it---little to much for her. At that time we made it a little more than halfway. We attempted it again on July 11th and succeeded. There were sections that were by far the most challenging hike that I've ever made due to the incline. However, we both soldiered on and agreed that it was well worth it once we got to the top. Pack plenty of fluid and food because you're exerting yourself all the way up--elevation change is about 1000 feet per mile (4.2 miles tot the top). Sat at the top and ate our lunch and made it down without a problem. Start to finish took 5 hours and 15 minutes. The landscape at the topics indescribable and I have to write that I'm very proud of her determination to see it through to the end! ","July 13, 2013",Challenging Hike,11,,5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Kenai Fjords National Park is mostly inaccessible, the best way to see anything is to take a boat cruise out to see the glaciers. We signed with Major Marine for an all day boat ride that took us out to Holgate and Aialak glaciers. We paid $409 for two people. This includes an all you can eat salmon/prime rib dinner. The food is okay, what is exceptional is what you will see from the boat.I did not anticipate seeing so much wildlife on this tour. We saw humpback whales feeding. We saw a pod of killer whales surfacing and diving. We saw dall porpoises as they raced ahead of the bow wave of our boat, surfing on along and diving. We saw sea otters. We saw a few harbor seals. We saw sea lions. We got a few distant glimpses of bald eagles. We saw sea birds: murres, kittiwakes, gulls, and puffins. The boat stopped at each of these animal sightings to allow the tourists to snap pictures. It was really terrific.In addition to spending 20 minutes in front of the Holgate and Aialak glaciers, we also saw the Pederson glacier, the Bear glacier and few other glaciers without names. The boat sat silently and watched for calving ice at both Holgate and Aialak - we did see some ice fall. It is hard to appreciate the scale - the boat got no closer than a 1/4 mile, but it looks much closer. When the ice falls, it makes a loud noise. Very cool to see, but it happens to fast to capture on film.We went with Major Marine tours, and it was an excellent way to explore the Kenai Fjords. I highly recommend this tour, it may well have been the best adventure we enjoyed on our Alaska vacation","July 9, 2013","Expensive, but worth every penny.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"If you stay in Seward you must take one of the 5+ hour boat tours into the Fjord! Please do not take anything less than this length of trip or you will not get out of the bay! It is one of the larger boats and travels quickly to many places. I have heard the smaller boats allow you more access to some areas but this was not an option for us due to a couple members of our party that get seasick rather easy. On the larger boats this is slightly diminished (neither of the 2 got sick on the trip)!We used the Kenai Fjord tour company. The service was great the snack was good and the hot chocolate chip cookies after battling the weather was amazing. The trip was taken on a cool rainy afternoon. We saw 8+humpback whales, seals, sea otters, puffin (multiple species), and porpoises. We also saw amazing views of water falls and the best closeup of the Akai Glacier! We spent 40+ minutes at the glacier watching it calf and looking at the amazing colors.The meal provided, an extra charge on the other major outfitter was good. The other provides a buffet of prime rib and salmon for an extra $20. The meal provided was a chicken wrap, carrot packet and granola bar (and the warm chocolate chip cookies on the trip in).Overall I would say if you are in Seward don't let the weather turn you away!

Just know that the emergency hut close to the top can be camoflauged well, we didn't see it the first few times we looked up the hill.

We moved from the outside top deck to a table on the inside lower deck as the inside top deck was full. In six hours we saw marine animals for a total of about half an hour and spent about half an hour at a glacier. The ""wraps"" served for lunch did not taste very good and were not filling. Bring your own lunch if you go. I slept during the two-hour return to port. To avoid too long a day, we spent the nights before and after the boat trip in expensive Seward. The total expense was not worthwhile. The Portage Lake glacier boat trip near Girdwood was a much better glacier experience. It was much less expensive and only an hour from Anchorage.","July 2, 2013",Make sure you'll have good weather,96,"San Lorenzo, California",3

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We went there on our last day as a recommendation for Ranger Chad on our Major Marine Cruise. We took the 10:00 Ranger led hike to the edge of the Exit Glacier. Our Ranger was Ranger Lew. Wow how knowledgable! I learned so much from him or our 2 1/2 hour mile and half hike (may be it was three miles, but it didn't feel like it). Usually he said only five or less people attend the Ranger lead hikes, but for some reason this day he had a group of over twenty. They were people of all ages. Ranger Lew did an excellent job of engaging the entire group of people, paying special attention to the kids in the group and asking them questions to make sure they were learning. Lew taught us all about the park, the glacier, they history of the land and vegetation. Ranger Lew had been volunteering at Exit Glacier for 9 seasons. What a gem the park service has in Lew. The hike was on paved and gravel trail and was not difficult at all. Ranger Lew went slow enough that there was really no difficulty involved. I would strongly suggest and encourage everyone to take a Ranger lead hike. This hike got us up extremely close to the glacier's edge. It is unbelievable how large the glacier is until you get up close to it. Deceiving in fact. Once you are that close you can gain a small perspective on how these forces of nature carve out the landscape. The whole family was in awe! Nature is just magnificent and everyone from the young to the old are never to young to start exploring or learning.

Loved this cruise and would like to go back to explore the Fjords. they were magical and mystic. ,"March 24, 2013",Kenai Fjord boat tour,88,pennsylvania,5

Kenai Fjords National Park,"I saw the National Park as part of a 4 hours tour from the Seward Marina conducted by Kenai Fjord Tours. We saw sea otters playing in the water, pods of Orca whale, humpack whales, porpoises, and harbor seals. Two highlights of the trip were seeing and hearing the glacier calve and the bald eagle we were lucky enough to observe on the return trip. The waters were calm for the most part, but there was a 10 -15 minute period in the Gulf of Alaska where it got really choppy and bouncy. Ginger candy and a bonine pill before getting on board was what was suggested to me before the trip, and that worked beautifully. That being said, I would eat lightly before the trip. The scenery is magnificent. I highly recommend seeing the park from the water!","January 6, 2013",See Marine Life & Glaciers Up-Close,57,"Palos Hills, Illinois",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"I love the Kenai area! It has the two mighty rivers, the Kenai and the Russian, the beautiful Kenai Lake, rustic cabins, good home-cooked meals at the mom and pop restaurants, and the fjords are breath taking.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We spent a whole week in the Seward/Kenai area and enjoyed kayaking, hiking, fishing, spotting wildlife and visiting the glaciers. We were shocked to see the lush vegetation, which we learned is due in fact to this area being categorized as a coastal rainforest. If you take a boat trip you will experience the Kenai Fjords which are like nothing I have ever seen. The raw beauty of the peninsula, and all of Alaska, is astounding. While there are plenty of pay-as-you-go activities, you can get just as much enjoyment by hiking the countryside/terrain, enjoying the quiet and undisturbed beauty of your natural surroundings, and it's free!!","November 4, 2012","Not to be missed, worth a trip south from Anchorage",69,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Kenai Fjords National Park,"This place is great! I've been on all-day boat tours through this park twice, and both times made life-time memories. On our first trip (June), we watched humpbacks breaching, tail-flapping, and obviously playing. We saw humpbacks on our second trip also, along with a pod of orcas. Both trips included excellent scenery - incredible glaciers flowing into bays, seabird rookeries, sea lions, seals, sea otters, incredible ocean vistas, and more! I also spent a day fishing in Resurrection Bay, and caught a bunch of silver and pink salmon. I would like to spend a month there.","October 22, 2012",One of my favorite National Parks,61,"Bismarck, North Dakota",5

The water, glaciers, whales, birds and peace make this one of our favorites in Alaska and a must see for all visitors. We spent 8 hrs. on a tour boat with only 125 people aboard and saw 3 glaciers, orcas, humpbacks, sea otters, sea lions, beautiful sea birds, and so much more...we would highly recommend seeing this park as it is a nice alternative to a big ship cruise with way to many people.

I called directly and asked and Linda who answered told me that is shouldn't be such a problem if we stayed outside and also told me that ""ginger candy"" which is sold everywhere in Alaska should help! And so I did, and although it was freezing cold outside because it was raining, it worked! We took the 8am 6 hour national park tour, booked online using the discount. We were fortunate enough to spot the whales several times! It is a much different view to see the fjords/glaciers on the ocean, and thought they looked different from the ones in Norway.

We saw whales, seals, sea lions, bald eagles, jellyfish as well as numerous other birds. The day was chilly, but we were dressed appropriately and thankfully had taken Dramamine prior to the trip to ward off any motion sickness. (Some folks weren't so lucky.) The staff were all very accommodating, food was good, and the main tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and pointed out sights along the way. The best part was taking time to actually watch and ""hear"" a glacier during the journey.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"Having done Kenai Fjords tours six times, the most recent being late August 2012, that pretty much tells you something. I never get sick of seeing great scenery and Kenai Fjords consistently offers terrific marine wildlife encounters.Have done all of the larger tour ship companies, and can recommend them all without hesitation.However, this time we went out on a small boat excursion through Alaska Saltwater Lodge & Tours. We had done a small boat whale watching trip out of Gustavus (southeast AK near Glacier Bay NP) back in 2009 and enjoyed the experience very much.Being late in the season, many of the humpback whales had already departed for Hawaii (who wouldn't like to do that for the winter?). However, we did see a few humpbacks, as well as the usual great sightings of sea otters, sea lions, puffins and other sea birds, as well as the stunning scenery and glacier views.The best part of this particular trip was something that we'd never experienced before, because it takes place late in the season. This is the time of year when the various pods of orca (killer whales) gather together so the bulls can ""mingle"" with the ladies from other pods.At one point in the day, we were fortunate enough to be surrounded by 4 pods of orca that numbered around 50 individual animals! It was incredible, and a definite highlight among all of my trips to Kenai Fjords NP.Every time I visit Alaska and spend time in Seward, and every time I speak with someone headed there and looking for things to do, a day on a boat in Kenai Fjords NP is always on the ""must do"" list.","September 29, 2012",Always an Incredible Experience,120,"Granada, Nicaragua",5

The crew did the best they could to help the ill, but not much could be done in the rough Gulf of Alaska. We had to skip the lunch buffet. Once we got close to the glaciers, things were better and we recovered some. Going back across a part of the gulf was almost as bad.

The ranger provided plenty of useful information along the way. An easy, paved, self guided walk is available to view the glacier as well.

First of all, we really lucked out because it was gorgeous-blue skies and sunshine. It was pretty nippy but we had dressed for that so it was not a problem. The boat had a ranger from the park who did an excellent narration of what we were seeing. You could sit inside or you could sit outside. I spent most of my time outside because it was so pretty. We lucked out again because we saw a pod of orca whales, then we saw humpbacks-WOW! We saw sea lions and otter and puffins, too. Lunch was prime rib and salmon and was so good. I will say that the water was quite rough -it rolled like the last car on a roller coaster-and some folks got seasick. The crew explained that this was common and not to be embarrassed about it. They had seasickness pills, candies and plenty of ginger ale for those who needed it. The crew was friendly and concered about the safety of those who were on the trip.

Kenai Fjords National Park,"We took the 9-hour Northwestern Fjords boat tour offered by the Kenai Fjords National Park. 9 hours might seem like a long time, but the scenery was always changing so it was well worth it. It was a cold, rainy day but the wildlife was out. We saw porpoises, puffins, sea lions, seals, and the highlight was a pod of killer whales. They were especially active that day, Aug. 30th, jumping out of the water. The Northwestern Glacier was incredible! The boat paused long enough and close enough to get a terrific view of the glacier. Our boat crew was very nice, and they provided plenty of food. We had a continental breakfast, caeser chicken wraps for lunch, and warm chocolate chip cookies later in the day. All day long they had free coffee and hot tea and there were additional snacks and drinks available for purchase. The seats are first come first serve so you'll want to get there early if you want a window seat with a table. The Northern LIghts coupon book has coupons for several different Kenai fjords boat tours including the Major Marine's tours. This was one of the best things we did on our trip to Alaska so I would highly recommend it. If you get sea sick then you might want to bring some meds with you.

In fact, we saw just about every creature we had hoped to see except whales who didn't feel like making an appearance that day.

We didn't give ourselves enough time here and would really of liked to hike all the way to the top of the glacier. My sister and I are in good shape but did not come prepared so we hiked up halfway to an amazing view spot instead and found it well worth it. It only took us maybe an hour to get up there however the whole hike is supposed to take 6-8 hours if you go to the top. The visitor center is very educational and we learned a lot about glaciers. Be careful though, there are a lot of bears and moose along the trails. We came across a black bear only half a mile from the visitor center. Park rangers were doing a great job making visitors wait until it was safe for the animal and humans alike. Other people saw moose on the trail as well.

We saw whales (Humpbacks and Orcas), sea lions, sea otters, Dall porpoise mountain goat and several different types of birds. The glaciers are amazing and you can get pretty close. We saw and heard them calf while we were eating the lunch provided. You will not starve on this trip. They serve food throughout the day. One note, if you are a vegetarian, tell them the day before and they will provide a vegetarian option (which was wonderful). We would also recommend to layer your clothing.

We enjoyed a salmon and prime rib dinner on the island. Our boys enjoyed relaxing on the beach after dinner skipping rocks. What a wonderful day in Alaska. It was certainly a highlight of our trip.
